2020-11-25,"Our feelings are supercharged today with our ambitions and our courage behind them. We can make brave moves if we put our minds to it. A powerful conjunction between the emotional Moon and warrior Mars in Aries at 6:39 pm EST can turn us into one-person powerhouses as we express ourselves through competitions, exercises, and debates. We have a strong need now to either defend ourselves or those who are weaker than us. We can rise to any challenge, but we must retain control of our tempers!","You’re the picture of courage as the Moon and brave Mars meet in your sign, but you could end up sticking your foot in your mouth if you’re not careful! Your rebellious nature can go overboard if you let your ego get control of your tongue, and you will want to avoid retaliating harshly if others offend you. Outbursts are likely, but you can also present yourself as a leader and a protector if you channel the energy correctly. Be a friend and a defender instead of a bully.","You may have dreams or possibly daydreams today that allow you to connect with your inner warrior, even if you’re normally a shy or reserved person. Everyone has a hero inside them but some are less showy than others. Where some heroes may use force or speed, others operate through faith, grace, and consistency, and this is where you can shine. Even if standing up and speaking up for what’s right feels intimidating, do what you know in your heart is right.","Your friends may get you excited or passionate about an issue or a new interest today. It's like you can feel the adrenaline pumping in your interactions with the people around you -- either in a heated debate or in vigorous agreement. Still, try not to get into arguments with strangers or people on the internet, as they will likely go nowhere and frustrate you. You will also begin to see quicker progress today in any group projects that were slacking. Speed is on your side!","Your career begins to ramp up in speed today and you can see vivid progress where there was stagnancy. Your reputation will be highlighted and others will admire your strength and tenacity, but you may be seen as competitive or aggressive by some. Avoid any backbiting or insults at work, because they will be more trouble in the long run. Try to keep your opinions about coworkers or bosses kind in order to keep your work relationships smooth. Build bridges, don’t burn them!","Your passion for learning and seeing other points of view is amplified now and you can get great insight from the wise and worldly people in your life. Any teachers or inspirational figures are returning to your memory and you’re remembering what used to drive you when you were still learning about the world. You can lose enthusiasm when learning feels like a chore, but now that there’s a renewed desire to expand your mind, put it to good use. Knowledge is power!","You’re feeling more courageous today, especially when it comes to your closest relationships, and you may feel more driven to demand respect or commitment. Power dynamics are shifting and boundaries may be set with intensity if you reach a stalemate, so you might want to refrain from cutting people off too harshly if you aren’t sure you’re ready to remove them from your life. Severing ties can be a blessing or a burden, and it’s up to you to decide who can stay in your circle.","Your relationships are heating up and even your enemies are feeling more passionately toward you. You’ll enjoy the spice added to any stale relationships, but those who are jealous or vengeful toward you could try to bring you down with an outburst or passive aggression. Not to worry, your powers of calm diplomacy will keep anything from getting out of hand. You have the composure to shut down any negativity in your midst. If you refuse to indulge their pettiness, they’ll end up just looking silly.","Your health or fitness are at the front of your mind and you can create better habits now that will make you stronger or faster. If you’ve been interested in learning self-defense or incorporating any new exercise into your lifestyle, now is a good time to do so. Avoid acting rashly or taking unnecessary risks, though, like overworking your body by working out too much in one day. Still, you can take small steps toward brave choices that help you to improve physically. You have the momentum ... use it!","Your analytical mind and your flair for thinking creatively are destined to create some eureka moments in areas that have been stagnant. Your mind is working quickly now and you will want to direct that mental prowess into games or puzzles rather than difficult tasks or drudge work. Your current ability to solve mindbenders and find answers will help you to look at your problems in a different way, allowing you to find creative solutions to issues you’ve been struggling with. Think outside the box!","Turn your boosted stamina toward your home today and you can get organized without breaking a sweat. It’s more stressful to live in a cluttered environment for you now, so attack any big cleaning or reorganizing projects that you have been procrastinating in order to remove that weight from your shoulders. There may be items in your home that are holding negative memories that are behind you now. Identify the items that you’ve outgrown or outworn and donate or sell them. It’s time to lighten your load!","There’s no holding you back today, at least not verbally! If you’re not careful, you could be spilling the truth about anything on your mind, so if you have a secret that needs keeping, guard it carefully. You have no problem being truthful right now, but your words might be perceived as offensive if you’re in polite company, so you may want to try to spend time with people who are okay with blunt honesty. Let the truth be told!","Your finances are seeing a boost in speed, but while you may receive money more quickly right now, you can also spend it just as fast! You may want to create a budget for yourself since your emotions can be sparked by shiny new material items more easily, which can cause you to forget things that you were saving for. You’ll also be feeling more secure emotionally, but avoid lashing out at anyone who made you feel insecure in the past. Success is the best revenge!"
2020-11-26,"It’s a day to connect, but it can be hard to maintain our identity in a crowd of loud voices. Sparks of tension are flying as the sensitive Moon squares chaotic Pluto, philosophical Jupiter, and critical Saturn throughout the day. We’re bound to meet with opinions that differ from ours and may have to maintain our footing in a confrontation by someone who disagrees with us. When the Moon enters Taurus at 10:43 pm EST, it’s easier to have a harmonious discussion. Come prepared with knowledge, kindness, and bravery.","Finances can be frustrating or out-of-sorts today so you will need to ground yourself in order to stay on the path to your goals. There are several distractions and impulse-buying opportunities in your midst, and if you don’t have a game plan in mind, then you might need to develop a budget at the very least. Financial miscalculations or emotional outbursts could cause problems with authority figures or parents today, so don’t bite off more than you can chew!","Your emotional sensitivity is high and you may be more likely to jump to conclusions, so make a mental note to take a beat before responding to what you’re perceiving as negativity. It’s easy to misinterpret people’s intentions or to feel a situation has become a disaster when, in reality, your emotions have magnified small issues. The more verbal self-discipline you have, the easier it will be to let these things slide off your shoulders. You’ll be happy that you breathed through the drama instead of responding in the moment.","Although this could be an isolating time, you might desire a little peace and quiet instead of being surrounded by friends. Take a break from the hustle and bustle and get in touch with yourself -- ask yourself questions you might ask a friend who you knew was struggling with your own struggles. Thinking affirming thoughts and being your own supportive friend will encourage you to start more positive self-talk, which we all need in order to grow. Be your own cheerleader!","Your relationships are at the forefront today and there could be a dispute between your lover and your friend. This could also be a situation where you have to choose between spending time with two different loved ones, and one may feel left out or hurt. Ultimately, try to remember that while the energy of the day can bring tension, it is only temporary and differences will be squashed before long. Let others air their grievances without trying to control them and you will come out fine.","It’s time to decide what it is that you truly want out of your day-to-day experiences. You may be feeling at odds with the older people in your life and are wondering if keeping the peace is worth the internal struggle that you’re dealing with. Tensions are high now between you and the people that you see as your authority figures or elders, but this is a momentary struggle. Reacting out of defensiveness or pride will not benefit you, but calm honesty will help you to succeed.","If you’re going to great lengths to have fun, today's energies could cause delays for you. Try to remember that anything that we are delayed from is likely done to protect us. You can trust that everything happens in its right timing. Don’t push too hard to make something happen if the planning seems to be falling apart. Instead, try to allow the day to take its course and be open to spontaneity if you meet too much resistance. If something is meant to be, you’ll know.","If you feel too beholden to someone, consider whether the power dynamics in the relationship are even or not. Pay attention to the actions of the people in your life, and if they shut you down every time you try to contribute or it always feels like a one-sided conversation, you may be trying to make a connection with someone who’s uninterested in your mind. Some boundaries will need to be set if you realize that you’re bending over backwards while they’re unwilling to budge.","Communicating your feelings may not come easily to you now -- you could even end up saying everything that you’ve been holding back completely unfiltered. Saying what we feel is normally like channeling water into a river, but today, it feels like a tsunami! While this could be affecting you directly, this could also mean someone else in your life will spill how they feel to you. Avoid any heightened emotional arguments because the intensity could grow bigger than you anticipated. Be genuine, but speak with kindness.","You may be feeling a little drained while you’re juggling everything in your schedule, so be sure to get adequate rest. You have a tendency to work through the lack of energy instead of listening to your body, which is understandable when you have goals and you don’t want to let anybody down. However, you have to prioritize your health today or you’ll end up forced to slow down. Others appreciate your dedication, but they want you to be healthy and happy!","Procrastination goes hand in hand with stress and, unfortunately, you might be hesitating when it comes to projects you’re working on or important conversations that need to be had. This is because you want to do things the right way, but if you wait too long, this opportunity might pass you by. Timing is almost as important as quality, and you could create hurt feelings or missed opportunities while waiting in the limbo of uncertainty. Go ahead and move forward and remember to speak from the heart.","Bad habits and forgotten issues can creep back in from the past now, and it is up to you to maintain your composure. Although temptation may be in your midst or you might be frustrated with family members, don’t resort to old coping mechanisms or argument cycles. Remember that there’s a difference between the old you and the new you, and the new you wants to support your future self, not self-sabotage. When you’re committed to the changes that you’ve made, you’ll feel fulfilled.","It’s time to be honest with yourself about your friendships. With some people, there’s a sentimentality that lingers, but when you speak, you don’t feel like there’s anything left to say. If you really want to save this relationship, then you’ll need to be honest with them and let them know how you’re feeling, but today is not the day to do this. It’s a time to decipher your feelings and realize whether or not the person that you are now can grow with the person that they are now."
2020-11-27,"It’s an ever-changing world that we live in and we can’t remain stagnant out of fear. Communicative Mercury's supportive sextile to dark Pluto makes it easier to talk about the sides of life that we often leave out of polite conversation. Furthermore, Venus' opposition to revolutionary Uranus at 12:11 pm EST refuses to let us do things the old way if it means staying unhappy. Today's changes can be difficult or unsavory, but with the emotional Moon conjunct Uranus, we’re ready to make progress and to stop resisting what feels right.","This is an innovative time for you when you can see growth in your investments or in any long-term relationships. Being honest with yourself about where you’ve been putting in effort and where you’ve let things go is the most powerful action you can take, and it is okay to forgive yourself for any lack of energy or dedication. Self-deprecation or regret will only hold you back, so instead, create a positive foundation for yourself that will allow you to stand tall in your endeavors.","A change of heart and mind is in the cards for you, but you may be concerned that these new beliefs will alienate you from the people who love you. Even if your personal philosophies and your close relationships feel at odds, you can’t deny the way you feel now, nor the way you love these people. As long as you are kind and clear when explaining yourself, the truth is, if they truly love you, they will come to accept you as you are.","Something is right on the tip of your tongue, but you can’t put your finger on it... You are present in your practical life and your stamina is high, but a dream or an old memory might be nagging at you for consideration. If you’ve been inspired by an idea from out of the blue, give it some weight -- it just may lead you to discover an interest or talent that was lying dormant. Letting your unoccupied thoughts take you on a journey can reveal new opportunities.","Your friends will be able to inspire you and give you the enthusiasm that you’re looking for and, if you’re open to it, you could even begin a relationship with a friend under today's influences. Whether it is a romantic or platonic atmosphere, you’re able to deepen your emotional bonds and realize how your friends and the community around you have helped to create the person that you are now. An attitude of gratitude will take you far, and people will not hesitate to help you.","You might be realizing that you’ve outgrown your career or the structures that you’ve built for yourself, but you don’t know which direction to take to leave this situation. A change of routine and scenery could benefit you if you can carve out a moment for yourself. Get out into in nature and look to the free growth of wilderness to inspire you. Nature doesn’t ask anyone where it’s allowed to grow, and if you’re ready to take on the challenge, neither should you.","Your sense of humor is amplified today and others will find your conversation charming, if not a little overwhelming. You’re more open about your unique philosophies and past experiences now, but there’s the danger of talking too much. If you can find a happy medium and remember to listen to others, it’s much easier to win people over to your side. If you can make also someone smile with a silly joke or a wild story, that’s a little extra happiness you’ve brought to their life!","Expect the balance of power to shift in your life -- those who you once needed help from may now need help from you. If they were generous with you in the past, you will be eager to help them, but if they were stingy with money or love before, you’re less likely to respond to the call. Instead of rubbing your current success in their face, it’s better to respond with kindness, or, if you know this person has taken advantage of you in the past, silence.","Friends could turn into enemies and vice versa today, so it may be necessary to set or edit boundaries. Instead of waiting to see if a problem will go away, re-evaluate the status of your friendships and romantic relationships. If you’ve been feeling neglected or overwrought in interactions with any of these people, ask yourself why it’s so hard to be with them. If course corrections need to be made, the people in your life will be able to take your feelings into consideration now.","Your mind is sharp today and you’re able to penetrate difficult topics without much of a struggle. However, make sure that you don’t waste this mental prowess on distractions or trying to find fault where there isn’t any. There’s a tendency to be interrogative or obsessive now, so instead of directing this focus at the people in your life, try to direct it into more spiritual or studious areas. If you can avoid being manipulative or accusatory, you and your loved ones can learn a lot about each other.","You’re feeling spontaneous and you want to talk about everything with the people that you love, including the ones who you haven’t talked to in a while. Reminiscing with people from times past can be wonderful, but there is the danger of wanting them to remain the same person they once were. Let others have the space to show you who they are now, even if it’s not what you were expecting. You’ve changed as well, so let your true self shine!","You aren’t interested in shallow conversations or small talk today -- you want to delve into the more intense subjects and you might try to open a discussion like this. However, if others don’t understand where you’re coming from, they could try to dismiss you or change your mind through debate. Try to be open-minded and realize that if someone disagrees with you, you don't have to retaliate against them. If they’re clearly closed off to thinking outside the box, it’s okay to just let a disagreement go.","Your mind is working at lightning speed and if you don’t want to waste this energy, be sure to do some brainstorming. Your first thought will be your best, so channel this mental energy into creative works or into long conversations with people who don’t mind jumping from subject to subject. Schoolwork or paperwork will be completed with ease, but you may make mistakes if you’re rushing through them recklessly. Trust your intuition, but read the instructions first!"
2020-11-28,"Daydreams and concrete plans are meeting each other head-on and it’s up to us to marry the two. Nebulous Neptune turns direct in Pisces at 7:36 pm EST, giving us the opportunity to remove toxic habits and negative beliefs from our lives. This will be helpful as the sentimental Moon's trine to severe Pluto brings intense, emotional relationships to the forefront and asks us to acknowledge our fears or obsessions. Happily, intelligent Mercury's sextile to philosophical Jupiter helps us integrate what we’ve learned about ourselves into our new beliefs.","You won’t want to tell your exciting news to everyone, because not everyone is ready to support you in your success. You will want to make your moves in secret because, despite envious eyes watching your actions, your career is steadily progressing and you can receive good advice from some close friends in your life. Focus on being better than the person you were yesterday instead of being in competition with others, and celebrate your wins with someone you trust.","You’re considering how you make yourself available to others and may need to set some boundaries with the people you love. There’s a difference between spending a healthy amount of time with your loved ones and spending all of your time with them. If you don’t take some time to be alone, you might end up disappointed when you try to force conversations that are out of words. Ground yourself now and remember that alone time is self-care!","A spiritual or emotional interaction with an older person or someone you look up to is likely, but you could hear stories from them that are confusing or that give you the wrong information. You cannot believe everything you hear or read, because even if they mean well, you can still be led astray by loved ones. It’s easy to be deceived or distracted now, but if you spend quiet time with someone you trust, intimate conversations and spiritual truths will be shared.","Friendships are highlighted for you and your sense of style and beauty is supported, so you’ll be on the lookout for fun today. Still, you may be extra sensitive to the opinions of others. Everything feels like it’s in a warm and fuzzy haze as long as things are positive, but there’s a tendency for drama if things go negatively. As long as you avoid jumping to conclusions, you can have playful conversations with your loved ones and give each other a laugh.","Commitments that you thought had dissolved are now rematerializing, and you'll need to decide whether or not you want to allow these people or situations back into your life. These may have been people or places that you were spiritually connected to, or they may have been enablers for bad habits that you once had. If you find you are trying to reason with yourself when the feeling in your stomach tells you not to return, then stay the course and leave this in the past.","It may be difficult to separate your own beliefs and feelings from those of others today. While it’s okay to empathize with people, try not to lose yourself within them. You may feel swayed by a romantic partner who’s trying to convince you of something, but you’ll get the best advice today from a sibling or a close friend. Stay level-headed and think twice before agreeing to anything that is being pushed too hard, especially if it’s something that you wouldn’t normally agree to.","A change of scenery is coming your way and you are ready to do the work needed to help usher it in. You may find a new place to live or you might beautify your home by rearranging furniture or putting some art on the walls. You have no motivation to do the same everyday chores now, so give yourself the freedom to react creatively when inspiration strikes you. If you can express gratitude for your living space and treat it like your temple, peace and stability will flow in.","Others may find the way you express yourself to be intense or aggressive now, but as long as you’re not being unnecessarily critical about the people around you, it’s okay to be assertive when it comes to what you want out of life. Not everyone will understand the honesty and security that you’re exerting, but some will be inspired by your lack of reservation when it comes to the truth. Your words can really change your future right now, so be true to yourself and speak your heart.","A confidence shines from within you today -- a more reserved and calm self-assurance than a bold assertiveness. You might feel like you’ve become more mature and that you’ve closed a childish chapter in your life. You may not have been aware of it while it was happening, but you’ve likely grown exponentially since the beginning of the year. Now that you’ve taken all those little steps toward standing on your own merit, the rewards for your consistent work are appearing before you.","You are feeling luckier than normal today and your faith in your potential and talents is high. You feel like you can take on any challenge, but you may not necessarily be communicating your ideas clearly. Don’t make promises you can’t keep, even though you feel like you can do it all in the moment, because in reality, you’re still only able to be in one place at one time! As long as you can keep your perspective, you can enjoy a positive atmosphere with your loved ones.","Working on a creative project or a surprise for a loved one in secret would be a great way to spend this day, because your generosity and your intuition are both flowing and you will want to share this with others. Your finances and your career are both in stable places, so send a loved one a card or get to work on presents for your family members. Your words and ideas are extra thoughtful and others will be thankful for the care that you put into your gift-giving.","When others ask you what you want, you may not have a clear answer to give them. Try to go with the flow and not plan out your schedule too specifically, because it can be difficult to control the course of your day. You will be more interested in discussing ideas for the future and daydreaming about what your life will become, and your friends can provide you with positivity and encouragement that will help to strengthen your belief in the future. Dream big!"
2020-11-29,"It can be harder to express how we feel with words early in the day as the heartfelt Moon is in the end degrees of Taurus, yet we can easily express ourselves through actions. While the Moon completes two trines to magnanimous Jupiter and practical Saturn we can be our best selves if we rise to the occasion and give back to others. Luna then enters Gemini at 11:16 am EST, making it easier to communicate our feelings and giving us the freedom to harmonize our hearts with our heads.","You can make great strides in your career or advance your public reputation now, and you’ll have the speed and stamina to complete any projects that you begin. If you have business contracts to sign or investments that you’re looking into, it would be best to wait until after the Moon moves into Gemini midday. Miscommunications or distractions could cause financial struggles if you don’t wait, so don’t be reckless with your work and check the fine print before you sign on the dotted line!","You feel secure and supported in your beliefs, but you may be stubborn when it comes to anyone who disagrees with you. Avoid trying to bully people into believing what you do, because although your conviction is strong and you mean well, what works for you will not always be what works best for others. Let everyone make their own decisions and don’t let others try to sway you away from your true desires, either. Live and let live is the motto of the day!","You will be able to see growth in your long-term investments of time or money with less effort than normal, yet you may experience delays or frustrations in your everyday routine. This is because your energy is low today or you are more accident-prone, so treat yourself with tenderness and care. Taking it slow and steady will help you to win the race. By moving along with determination, you will show your maturity, which could even lead to a business opportunity from an older and wiser person in your life.","Old friends and new friends may compete for your attention today, but you will have a good time no matter who you decide to go with. You may even see a friendship or relationship end now, and if you do, trust that this is for the best and that they were meant to leave your life so that there is room for someone new. You can also market your skills now if you are looking to move into a new career, so be open to fresh situations!","Your physical and mental health are supported today and you feel ready to take on the world. While your career and your home might both require more work than usual, you have the stamina to take on any challenges thrown at you. If you’re looking for help, there will be people in your corner ready to speak up for you and put in a good word. You are organized and practical now and others will see you as someone who has it together. Take pride in your hard work!","You’re more aware of how you want to express yourself now and your close friends can help you realize your potential. Doors that you thought were closed have reopened, and something like a makeover or a new outfit could really boost your confidence. Now that your eyes are open to the possibilities, do your research before you accept the first opportunity presented to you. Trust the people who love you because they will have good suggestions, but in the end, express yourself in the way that makes you happiest.","You have the opportunity to put grudges behind you now. You will know which axe to bury by realizing which long-standing issues return to your mind again and again. You can’t hurt the person back who hurt you by lingering on this pain. In fact, the longer you let this resentment take root, the longer you allow this person to have control over you. If you’ve removed this person from your life, you don’t have to let them back in, but you do need to heal the wound on your heart.","You have a cheerful and concise way with words today that will make your interactions go smoothly. People appreciate your realistic but positive way of thinking and they’ll be more willing to help you with your tasks. Your education is favored, so learning a new skill or subject is a worthy pursuit and you’ll retain knowledge without much effort. Or, if you teach or explain a topic to someone else, they will be able to understand you well. Share the knowledge!","You can expect to see material gains today from the investments you’ve worked on. You can also make positive business decisions now, especially if they are presented to you by someone you’re in a romantic relationship or business partnership with. Your energy may be low or you may be mentally foggy earlier in the day, but if you spend a little extra time eating a healthy breakfast and starting the day with a positive mindset, you will feel fulfilled by bedtime.","You’re remembering what originally inspired you when you were younger, possibly because you have strayed from your initial goals. If you are afraid to be honest with yourself about where you’re going or even if this path is still the one you want to be on, you’ll end up feeling stagnant rather than growing into the person you truly want to be. Ask yourself if you’re living in alignment with your ideals and, if not, you may need to remove a negative influence from your life.","You may feel pulled in multiple directions right now, worried about making the wrong choice by putting your energy behind one sole interest. The truth is, if you continue to scatter your energy in multiple directions, you won’t be able to reach your destination. It’s okay to be a jack of all trades, but if you’re constantly struggling to make a decision, you’ll end up exhausted. If you’re feeling worn out, get in touch with your inner voice and your intuition will show you your real priorities.","You can meet generous and well-meaning people today who are meant to help you build the life that you’ve been dreaming of ... but if your ego gets in the way, old prejudices will rear their ugly head. Avoid being judgmental of the people around you when it comes to superficial attributes, because you never know who might turn out to be a loyal friend in the future. The more accepting of others you are, the more likely they are to be accepting of you."
2020-11-30,"The truth is in front of us and, when we face it with clarity, we can move forward. The fourth and final Lunar Eclipse of the year occurs in Gemini at 4:30 am EST, helping us to let go of what holds us back from the unknown. We shift into a braver, more curious perspective as intellectual Mercury sextiles serious Saturn, eliminating our hesitations, and the gentle Moon sextiles passionate Mars, giving us an extra dose of courage to face our fears. Honesty is the first step to healing!","Expressing yourself and connecting with others are difficult when you’re on the defensive. Cyclical relationship or friendship issues can come up now, but don’t take the low road. If you have unhealed emotional scars from people who hurt you in the past, you must address them now and begin to unravel them so that you don’t project these emotions onto new people in your life. Commit to being the biggest person and these negative cycles will begin to break down.","Digging in your heels and refusing to budge will not suffice to solve the problems in your life right now. Although being vulnerable can be difficult, sometimes we have to tell people what we’re really thinking in order to avoid becoming resentful later. If you’re uncomfortable with the way someone treats you, you have to let them know, and if there’s a problem that you need help solving, there’s no shame in asking for help; you aren’t showing weakness, you’re showing the ability to graciously accept support.","Your friends can help you to see your strengths and talents more accurately than you, yourself, can at the moment -- you might be selling yourself short when it comes to what you deserve. If you always play in the background in situations where a leader is required, then you won’t receive the recognition that you seek, but if you always try to take control of a situation, you may need to work on becoming a team player. Find a balance between being a hero and being a helper.","You may be realizing that you are feeling spiritually unfulfilled by your career or by your circle of friends. If you’ve been acting out of character and following the crowd despite what your heart is telling you, you can get back in touch with your internal compass by spending some time alone in nature or by spending one-on-one time with a wise friend. If you’ve been true to yourself throughout this time, then someone may ask you for advice on a spiritual matter. Speak from the heart!","There could be an emotional interaction with a friend that leads you to ask yourself if you did or said the right thing. Although you never meant to cause harm, you may still be unsure after you hear their reaction. Ultimately, it’s beneficial to remember that we can’t control the perceptions of others and, even if someone’s reaction wasn’t the one that you intended to cause, you can’t always predict how people will receive your words. Speak the truth with kindness and accept what you can’t change.","Tap into your youthful side and bring out your sense of humor today! You’ve had your nose to the grindstone for quite some time, but if you’re all work and no play, you’ll end up burning out sooner or later. If you’re feeling cut off from other people, show a little more interest in the lives of your coworkers and friends instead of your work. Empathy and encouragement will work to spark more positive emotions and your loved ones will be thankful that you tried to brighten their day.","Someone may try to sway you from a decision you feel strongly about and you’re not sure if you should stick to your guns or change your focus. Listen to your intuition and ask yourself which actions are in line with your personal beliefs. People act as if giving into peer pressure is easily avoided, but in reality, it can be hard to say no to the people we love. You’re the one who will end up living with the decision you make, so do what makes you happy.","There is a friendship or relationship that you can see going down a separate path from you, but it's still painful to create distance. You don’t want to go along with actions that aren’t right for you, but it’s also not your place to force someone to follow in your footsteps. It’s better to accept that you may meet up again someday, but for now, you must let each other pursue different interests with freedom. If your emotional connection has become suffocating, it’s time to give each other some space.","New and creative opportunities are blossoming for you, but if you get swept away with the possibilities, you could lose the security you have. If you find that you’re risking reliable situations for glamorous, new ones -- especially if they sound too good to be true -- just be sure you can afford to lose what you have. You’re looking at the big picture, but the big picture should include the people who have supported you in the past. Act with gratitude and remember your roots to be successful.","Your relationships with the people you see every daily are highlighted, and you will need to be patient with yourself and them.

Nobody’s perfect and accepting that mistakes happen makes it easier to try again.","Your intuition is working in harmony with your mind, helping you come up with complex solutions to problems that have plagued you in the past. However, there’s a tendency to turn this desire to fix things toward people in your life who don’t necessarily want to be fixed. A simple, listening ear will make others more likely to share with you again. You can be hands-on with your own problems, but let others come to their own conclusions. Most people are looking for empathy instead of advice.","Your work/life balance is in focus now and you can grow emotionally closer to your loved ones as well as further your career. However, listen to your body and make sure that you’re not neglecting your health in order to keep up with everything you’re trying to accomplish. If you’ve been filling your time with the priorities of others and leaving none for yourself, it will come back to bite you. Rebalance your activities and errands with a little self-care and your body will thank you."

However, our imaginations can start to take over the narrative once the sensitive Moon sextiles dreamy Neptune. Life may truly feel stranger than fiction, but you can embrace the bizarre and enjoy the eccentricity by engaging in really out-there conversations and playing around with fantastical ideas.","Your attempts at finding clarity with others may leave you empty-handed today. Things seem to align in strange ways, never quite reaching a meeting of the minds. You are able to connect with people in some unusual circumstances, however, by bringing eccentric ideas and methods into your activities. Standard tasks will need to be completed regardless of how detached you are feeling, so set a schedule and try to stick with it while you attempt to make sense of the nonsensical.","The weirdest topics seem to appeal to you today, but just go with it. You are not imagining things; sometimes life is just a bit strange. Your instincts will tell you how to act or be, so embrace your uniqueness. The things you end up learning about your self-identity along the way can be very useful for you at this time. Show the people you spend time with who you really are -- you may be surprised at how receptive they will be.","Your thought process is brought down into the physical world today, reducing the speed of things so that it all seems to be moving in slow motion. Use this perceived time warp to get things accomplished and get organized -- putting things in order will help you temper any distortion. Your conversations, although they seem grounded in reality, may have a tendency to go off on tangents now. Be creative in how you relate to others and, when in doubt, state only what you know to be true.","You want to create the perfect atmosphere for your life and the events or gatherings that may be taking place today. Your eye for making things homey and comfortable can be put to good use. Invite in everyone’s ideas by communicating as much as possible. Things may be easily misconstrued, so repeat yourself if necessary or restate what you mean in an imaginative way. All will be well and come together better than you expect, so try to relax as you go.","You may need to adjust in some way today to make space for new forms of technology or digital communication. Perhaps you are finding different ways to connect with friends and family for the holidays this year. Although you may wish to be together in person, this is a beautiful opportunity to evolve the way you create community. As you interact, be receptive to the ideas of others, but don’t feel like you have to go along with everything. If you have a different idea, empower yourself to share it.","What you are feeling today is textured and multidimensional and simply must be expressed. Channel all that is happening in your intuitive mind into something creative that you can share with others; your brilliant mind is best put to use now through imaginative activities and projects. Although you may have some chores calling your name, this is a day of magic that should be embraced. Real life can wait until later -- right now, answer the call of your creative spirit.","You may stand out as more radical amongst family today, valiantly standing up for your point of view or a cause you believe in. However, your emotions are competing with your intellect, which can muddle your message or make you want to detach or retreat altogether. Instead, deepen your commitment to making time with loved ones as fulfilling as possible. You are nourished most by close contact with others, so figure out a setup that works for you.","Rather than try to force things to happen a certain way today, appreciate things as they are and know that relaxing and being present is just fine. For the moment, just be, watch, observe, and don’t feel obligated to say anything unless you want to. Your mind is processing things in a more melodic way and you need to take your time when conversing. Be deliberate with your words and in your explanations, especially as it relates to being in the company of others.","Your judgement may be a bit clouded today, so keep this in mind if someone counters an opinion yours. It is okay to stand up for the things you believe in -- in fact, it's essential to your high ideals. Just do your best to remove your emotions from the equation and think rationally. By looking at things from a bird’s-eye view, the interactions you have with loved ones and close friends can be gentler and more productive.","Although you may feel a bit emotionally detached today, this can actually help you solve a problem or smooth out a relationship. A cool set of emotions allows you to approach things with the perfect balance of idealism and realism. Make a point to meet in the middle on something or to compromise in some way, and be sure to follow through with your intentions -- taking action is the only way to truly show your commitment to establishing harmony.","Notice the things that you don’t say today -- some internal feelings may be causing you to hold back. You will have to muster confidence in order to push through the protective shield you are wearing. Try not to be too rigid in your mindset as well. Even if you have a plan worked out of how you want things to be today, be ready for sudden shifts or alterations. A commitment to being flexible will help to temper any nervous energy.","Some of your interactions today may feel disjointed: slowed down in some ways but electric in others, giving the day an overall feeling of unpredictability. Instead of trying to force things in a certain direction, get comfortable shifting in and out of different emotional states, especially when it comes to being around others -- each interaction you have will require you bring a different energy to the table. Participating in as many things as you can will help you feel both involved and fulfilled."
2020-12-26,"We are able to jump to a higher point of view today and see things through a brighter lens. The feelings-heavy Moon enters curious Gemini at 6:33 pm EST, then forms two trines shortly after with both restricting Saturn and expanding Jupiter. Our moods will be most affected as we engage in an internal battle between stillness and action. Choosing one side will be helpful, giving us an outline for how to approach our thoughts and experiences.",You can be particularly chatty today with lots of opinions to share. Focus on your friends and the groups you belong to -- there are things you bring to the collective that can be informative and uplifting to all. Keep your mind open and fluid and let it go where it wants to; you will easily be able to tell the difference between objective thinking and subjective. Use this awareness in your conversations to provide the clarity or inspiration that's needed.,"Your appearance in public may be the central concern of your day. Don’t overthink or scrutinize what you are putting out there -- you naturally come across with ease and charisma, so be your authentic self and things are likely to flow as they should. The people you come in contact with may or may not agree with your point of view and that is okay. You can’t please everybody, but at least make sure you are pleasing yourself.","Your desire to connect with others is paramount at this time, with you needing to see, talk, and spend time socializing with the people in your life. The Moon entering your sign can spur on increased attention and outgoing energy, and your desire to be with others is amplified today in a way that may feel rebellious or against the grain. Boundaries -- including any decision to break free from them -- will need to come from your own sense of what feels right.","Your unusually detached emotional attitude will help to get you through this busy day. There is more activity than you are used to, with increased messages and conversation in general. Clearly schedule out your time if you want to accomplish your goals and don't feel bad about enlisting the help of others; there is no reason you should have to do it all alone. Today's increased social energy allows you to stay productive and have fun without the weight of feelings and expectations.","You have the chance to socialize more today, but be mindful to keep things high-vibe and positive. There is no need for conflict or differences in opinion to dominate your conversations -- as tempting as that may seem. You will enjoy your time with others much more if things are kept casual, relaxed, and fun. There may be a lot of chatter around the status of a relationship between you and someone else, but only share as much information as you feel comfortable getting into at the moment.","Activity is increasing around the things that you have to do today, especially if you are at work. You may be spotlighted in your career or some other public way as the Moon moves into your 10th House of Reputation. Decide how you want to be seen and only project or engage in actions that match up with this. If something misaligns with your values, leave it by the wayside. Your image is yours to manage how you want.","Movement is likely today, with travel plans or other events taking place that you'll need to be in transit for. Things are feeling more social and uplifted in general, so enjoy the ride and the time you spend with others. The main issue to be aware of is sensitive topics arising between you and the people you're around that release a little tension into the air. You have a unique talent for seeing things from all sides, so step into the role of peacemaker if you must.","Share your thoughts sparingly today, as you may not be entirely sure where you stand on something. You need more information, so acknowledge what you already know, then put some energy into sensing what is still missing. Bit by bit, clues are dropping in, so keep exploring their meaning as you construct a more complete picture of what is going on. You are in your element today, capable of grappling with contradictions and dealing with life’s complexities.","You may start to backtrack on something you say early in the day after you see how others respond to your perspective. It is hard to face criticism when you feel whole-heartedly right about something. Use patience in your communications and give people the benefit of the doubt, including yourself. Do your best to think objectively, especially if engaging in business today. A clear mind is possible, you just have to first weed out the things that don’t fit with this mindset.","Your schedule or projects could fluctuate today, requiring you to flex your time or your attitude. How you respond will reflect on you -- and your work, if this is business-related -- so act accordingly. If your money is involved, set clear boundaries and expectations, or at least start asking questions about what others are requiring from you. When you know what to anticipate, everything tends to work out better. Do everything you can today to not let your fluctuating moods interfere with your decisions and relationships.","You may feel like you're acting outside of yourself today, with little internal dialogue or consideration for what you are feeling emotionally. As you exert your expertise in the projects, relationships, and endeavors you're involved with, you will get a sense of your essential role. Bigger issues can be discussed and planned for right now, so apply yourself with intelligence and pragmatism. If you feel agitated due to too many perspectives, narrow down your focus. It's okay to take on one task at a time.","It's all about what's going on inside for you today -- you may be hoping to get clear on some issues you have been having. Take this opportunity to facilitate conversations that are productive and go deep to the heart of a matter. You are likely to get more emotional when interacting, so be in honest alignment with how things are making you feel. Honor your desire for clear communication, but make room for the emotive self-expression that may also need a voice today."
2020-12-27,"We are moved by powerful stories today, seeking out things that strengthen our minds and experiences. Energy around us is starting to build and many are sensing this within the collective consciousness. The intense Sun forms an easy trine to unpredictable Uranus at 10:25 pm EST, giving us the opportunity to enhance our own identities by expressing the things that make us feel unique. We can act without much forethought, putting our opinions and ourselves on the line with force.","You may feel an urgent and tremendous desire to stand out in your place of work or in public today.

Channel your relentless drive into accomplishing something important today.","A stroke of brilliance allows you to understand entire concepts in an instant today; use this gift to learn something new or to participate in something unique. Because your mind is able to take in more complicated information and understand the meaning behind it, you have the opportunity for some powerhouse conversations. Seek out people you want to have a discussion with and come with a good argument. Harmonious yet thought-provoking discourse can be very inspirational to you right now.","You are more upfront about the things that are on your mind today, adding a sassy, sarcastic energy to your interactions. What you decide to share is largely dependent on the atmosphere around you -- it may feel difficult to liberate yourself from the usual boundaries that are present, hence the need for humor to get through the day. Try to take on things as information instead of emotion, so as not to stress or worry too deeply; a certain level of detachment can help you right now.","You may be looking for some definition when it comes to the status of a business partnership or close friendship. There is nothing wrong with needing to have these clarifying conversations, so don’t feel bad about it -- you are entitled to know what is going on. Pursue more information, especially if logic tells you to keep looking deeper. Things will start to feel extremely balanced within your peer, work, and social groups when everyone is being real about what is going on.","Various areas of your life are starting to overlap and you'll need to draw up some boundaries to bring back the structure and balance you need. Work, wellness, and your home life would do well with more compartmentalization. Consider ways to make this possible and how to better manage your daily tasks, workspaces, and schedules so you don't feel overwhelmed. Program your agenda in a way that is not only healthy and manageable but also sustainable.","You can be decidedly lustful today, ready to give in to decadent behavior and desires. Release some pressure and let yourself go a little. You are naturally focused and productive, so minimal effort will be needed for you to keep your responsibilities on track. Enjoy your wild side and seek out the things that truly excite you. Today should be about pleasure, so challenge yourself to give in to your indulgences without expecting yourself to feel guilty the following day.","Flexibility is the answer today as you may be stubbornly holding on to something that is not working. The need for pliability does not mean you have to start from scratch, though. Instead, try re-entering the situation with a new mindset. A lot of ideas may be generated though group brainstorming now, so get together with like minds and transform something about the way you are currently thinking. Many heads are better than one, as long as yours remains open to a new view.","Make a strict commitment to stay disciplined and on task today. The things you engage in will require more focus, but by strengthening your attention, you will be able to accomplish more than you set out to do originally. Put some of this productive energy into a working relationship, like a business partnership or marriage, which will benefit form your strategic efforts. This is a great day to have a detailed conversation about organizing, schedules, and accounts, while keeping target goals at the forefront.","Harness the power of the beginner’s mind today; let yourself start from scratch. Getting back to the drawing board will give you more options and provide you with an opportunity for a new approach. You may be feeling a need to take action toward your ideals in some way, especially in relation to your daily work or routine, and this is a good time to start make some small changes. Be experimental and take a risk. Make your decisions from a place of confidence that things will work out.","Focus on your creativity today and the things that inspire you from deep within your imagination. In this open state, fresh information is more likely to drop into your mind unexpectedly, prompting you to take action. Utilize your unique skills to problem solve and innovate; you are able to relax and breathe a little life into the things you are working on now. Your leadership qualities can emerge easily and the attention you will generate is around things you actually want to be known for.","You’ll have the opportunity to use your skills of diplomacy today, navigating relationships within your home or current living arrangement.

The universe is supporting your openness and authenticity -- you could even become the center of attention among your friends or other groups for your special experiences and skills. Find a way to express your true self given the tools that are available to you right now. An honest and open personality will attract others who can appreciate you for who you are.
2020-12-28,"Our connections feature prominently today, giving us a wonderful opportunity to bring more self-awareness to our relationships. The intuitive Moon's opposition to social Venus at 1:47 am EST makes us more alert to each other’s needs. Later, the Moon forms a sextile with passionate Mars, galvanizing our attention spans for even further interaction. We need to be conscious of how things are coming across, though, especially as it relates to our moods. It's important to be both considerate and adaptable now.","You can have a ton of fun today if you choose to set aside some of the more serious topics of the moment and focus a light-hearted energy onto your friendships and relationships. Short, constant bursts of interaction are really what you need -- you can chameleon from group to group in person or on social media, adding in a few quips and comments. Play up the comedic relief that others may need; your willingness to step into this role comes more naturally now.","You may feel as if worlds are colliding in your personal life today as unrelated groups come together in unexpected ways. Make space for all the different emotions this can bring up. Trying to orchestrate too many interactions at once can be very draining on you, so attempt to edit down your to-do list. You may also be attracted to doing something just for the novelty of it now. Your wildcard energy is a lot of fun, but be cautious not to overextend yourself.","Your focus is fixated on a single idea or person today, making it harder to see the entirety of a situation. It's likely your other activities will be interfered or halted if you become consumed in a narrow mindset. Consider how you can shift your attention off a particular topic if it is taking up too much of your time. In order to get anything accomplished, you will need to move a few things around. Stay busy so you can distract yourself from restlessness.","You may go to great lengths to be considerate today, making accommodations and even modifying your behavior for the sake of others. Your ultimate goal is to create an easy flow in public, at work, or at home, but this need could be stemming from some underlying emotional jitters. Find little ways to feel settled throughout the day by slowing things down. Constantly being busy will just add to the heightened energy; take your time and realize things aren't as urgent as they may feel.","You can have a pretty good time today, especially when socializing or connecting with friends. Embrace this energy by being the one to set up an activity with a pal or get on social media to engage with others. Communication is snappy and quicker than usual, but you should be able to keep up with the pace. If possible, plan to do things that are fun, imaginative, and captivating. Your attention span can’t take too much slowed-down detail today, so fast-paced activities are best.","Your work or your professional relationships are especially influenced by your mood today as your mind zeroes in on how you feel about a certain situation. Remain curious about why this is and investigate where your surface feelings are actually coming from. Finding your deeper truth will require some effort, though, as your motivation is there, but your focus may not be. Stay flexible to your shifting needs and only jump into a deep, personal analysis if you really feel up for it.","You're in planning mode today and you may want to orchestrate a meeting of some kind. Changing schedules can interrupt even your most careful planning, however, so use your even-keeled emotional abilities to flex with things as they unfold. If your first idea doesn't work, consider what else you might be able to do. Run through different scenarios in your mind to see their end, then notice what outcome looks best and do what you can to see it to fruition.","It may feel like you have more work or responsibilities today, with things piled on you that weren't there just a few days ago. This doesn't really bother you, though -- in fact, you welcome the distraction. You seem to thrive among the constant changes that are taking place now.

Seek out others who want to get together and exchange ideas or gossip, or just catch up on life.","Life is meant to be enjoyed today, or at least you should be feeling a little lighter and more liberated overall. You can find yourself in easy interactions with others, generously chatting and engaging in interesting discussions. At times you might feel a slight dip in your energy levels, but nothing that cannot be cured with a little rest or a break. Staying mostly active will keep your mind focused and your momentum flowing, so sign up for tasks or projects that will help you stay busy.","You may not be feeling very social today, preferring your own space to unwind, away from others. Your mood could interfere in your relationships, however, so muster up some patience in preparation -- it might be impossible to get away amongst a flurry of activity. Things seem to keep changing on you, with indecisive energies dictating the flow of the day. Try to get through any necessary conversations and responsibilities quickly and spend the rest of the day watching and listening.","Your natural clarity of mind is exactly what you need right now, as things are jumping around at a very fast pace. Although there are seemingly endless shifts happening today, stay alert to the things that remain constant. Being in touch with your truth can be extremely helpful to your wellness, as your personal life is unfolding in exponential ways. Make sure you know where you are headed and try not to lose sight of your grander vision in the day’s chaos.","Small moments of insight today seem to relate to the overall theme of your life at this time. Each of these microcosmic interactions allows you to consider your own deeper truths. Explore further. Find joy in the journey and the things you are learning along the way. If you release some attachment to a set destination, you are much more likely to find pleasure in where you end up. Let go of preconceived ideas of what your outcome should be."

Engage with your authenticity and what the idea of connecting means for you right now. You have a greater capacity today to tap into emotional currents and understand yourself. Your choices are fueled by much more than just exterior facts, so look for what else is at play -- the things just beneath your facade.","Your responsibilities may feel multilayered today as several different areas of life require your attention; tackling it all can be a daunting task.

When the emotional Moon moves into opposition with mental Mercury, our emotions take up even more airtime. We can get the most out of this energy by indulging in a foray of our feelings.","You are markedly more sentimental today and may be reminiscing about the past and seeking out anything that gives you a sense of nostalgia. This longing for what has been can create a vague sense of melancholy, yet it may be best to just wallow in the emotions. Consider tucking yourself in for the day and settling into activities that create homey or warm feelings inside. Seek comfort in your favorite things, foods, or interests. Relish some alone time if you can.","The muses are with you today, inspiring your work and artistic sensibilities. Give your focus over to creative endeavors, and consider how you can bring more beauty into your everyday experience by making some small changes.

Prepare to move through some mixed emotions as things progress. The people you encounter may be giving off conflicting messages and the information coming through is not completely adding up. Take note if you are contributing to the confusion in any way as well. Consider the background on topics before you say them out loud, so as not to accidentally spread inaccuracies.","A vague sense of uncertainty may hold you back from speaking impulsively today. You can break through this self-doubt by embracing a non-perfectionist attitude at the start of the day. It's likely you will be involved in some kind of meetings or discussions, and these interactions may slip into wild tangents and inventive spin-offs. It can all be very exciting if you let yourself run with it, so let go a little and just roll with the nebulous vibes.","The time you spend with others today is the perfect antidote to everything else that may be occurring around you. Socializing -- however you choose to engage in it -- will fulfill a need you may not have even known was there. Use your time together with friends and loved ones to build each other up and create a network of support. Share as much love as you can, demonstrating your appreciation through your actions to those you care about. Keep deepening your important life connections.","Emotions rotate through you today in a way that can be endearing to others, because they may not be used to seeing you so expressive. Your best bet is to just go with it, because it will be hard to tame this influx of feelings you are experiencing. As you surrender to yourself more fully, you will be able to devote more energy to your passions. If you apply the same kind of discipline to your creativity as you do to your work, results will flourish.","You may need to communicate your feelings in a clearer way today. Try to take a logical approach while you plan and think about the message you actually want to convey. Deep conversations are possible with coworkers, family, or friends. You may be feeling a need to dig into some topics that have been off limits in the past. If any old feelings re-emerge in the process, they can be addressed with more clarity under today's energies.","You could be in need of an outlet today or some kind of distraction -- a way to keep your mind off of things.

Balance out this tension with an activity that offers you mental growth.","This is a deeply transformative period for you, especially when it comes to your intimate relationships, soul bonds, and the things you share with others. Much of this moment is about doing inner work and making changes on your own terms, but today, Mercury will align with magical Neptune in your very public 10th House of Reputation.

Still, don’t be surprised if fun times come calling as the Moon interacts with the vibrant Sun in your 5th House of Passion and Creativity. Even if you planned to hide away in solitude, the holiday might urge you to come out and enjoy yourself regardless.","There’s an interesting balance for you today between casual and intense, public and private. You might be in the mood to spend the day connecting or reconnecting with special people, yet have little motivation to get moving. Throughout the morning, the sleepy Moon will be at an awkward angle to the Sun in your 4th House of Home and Family, so getting out of bed might take a few extra hours than usual, but the afternoon promises pleasurable social opportunities.","You may well have the day off, but regardless of whether or not you’ve anything serious on your plate, don’t be shocked if you feel the urge to make today count one way or another.

Though it may be against your nature, try to go with the flow and see where it takes you; chances are, you’ll like where you end up.","Though you tend to be a free bird, you might feel inclined to start this year out with someone by your side. This certainly doesn’t have to be a romantic someone; this is about support and camaraderie, so a best friend or other close partner will do just fine. Although the morning may have you lazing in bed or puttering around the house, by the time the afternoon rolls around, the social bug will come to bite you.","You’ve been in a rather outgoing frame of mind these days, eager to connect with others and share what you know. Today, though, you might prefer to keep your cards close to your chest rather than reveal your hand. You can't take something back once you've said it, so you're wise to keep quiet until you've gained more information or grown more comfortable with what you have to say. The mood will lighten as the day progresses and your confidence will expand."

The Moon in your 10th House of Career Goals will reach out to both Venus in your financial house and Mars in your work house, helping to support your real-world aspirations.

While the Moon in your 11th House of Global Community is positively aspecting the Sun in your communications sector, don’t be surprised if information comes to you from afar. At the same time, if there's something you need to know, have the courage to go looking for it yourself.","You can make leaps and bounds at work right now, so don’t be scared to roll up your sleeves and burn the midnight oil. While the Moon in your goal-oriented 10th house is forming a positive angle to the primal Sun in your 2nd House of Earned Income, a project could finally start to pay off. Or, perhaps a VIP notices the effort you’ve been making and decides it's time for a raise. The universe is offering you help right now, so don’t turn it down.","How far can your mind take you today, Capricorn? Even if you can’t travel far physically, the Moon is moving through your 9th House of Boundlessness, so a bit of expansion wouldn’t hurt, even if only on a mental level. The Moon's trine to the Sun in your sign has your energy at an all-time high, so channel this motivation into a new course of learning that takes your world view and makes it ten times more inclusive and expansive.","Intimacy is the name of the game as the Moon travels through your 8th House of Soul Bonding today. Her positive trine to the energizing Sun in your private 12th house may have you wanting to disappear behind closed doors with someone special, like a romantic interest, best friend, or other loved one. Whether physical or emotional, the things you share together now can deepen and your connection profoundly.

2021-01-04,"There is a mood of major efficiency permeating the universe today as the Moon orbits through analytical Virgo, syncing our emotional vibrations with a desire to improve ourselves. This theme is amplified by the powerful, once-a-year conjunction between communicator Mercury and alchemical Pluto happening at 7:58 pm EST in achievement-oriented Capricorn. As our thought process joins up with our desire to transform, almost anything is possible. We must take care not to speak too sharply, however; words can be weapons right now.","You’ve got your eye on life’s great ladder right now and there is almost nothing standing in your way, so be prepared to climb a few rungs. This is a wonderful time to bring attention to any major work projects you’ve been plowing away at over recent months; with the stars supporting you, a major VIP could take notice of your efforts. Don’t keep your light hidden now, because you don’t want to miss out. Roll up your sleeve and get to it!","Your mind can take you far today; you are more than prepared to dive into any subject of interest, so it’s a great time to open a fresh book or lose yourself in a Wikipedia wormhole. Something that sparks a creative fire within you can also have deep spiritual meaning -- just because something is fun doesn’t mean it can’t also be important. Look for things that bring you joy, but also improve your self-worth and expand your mind. In what ways can you grow?","Conversations could get very deep today, but you will benefit from engaging with these issues rather than trying to avoid them. Matters of shared finances might be on the table and, while you will want to come out on top, do your best to ensure that it isn’t at the expense of anyone else. Likewise, your passions could bubble over if you have been trying to suppress them, so do your best to control them so they do not control you.","It’s all about you in relation to someone else today. You could meet someone now who will have all the impact of a meteor on your life, so be open to starting conversations and getting to know people. It's also possible you'll reach a major milestone with a romantic or business partner, or you may be discussing plans for your future together.

This is a great time to pick up a new workout regimen, so find something that will make you feel really alive and get your blood pumping.","It’s a day to answer the Muse when she comes calling, but don’t be scared to pick up the phone and make the call yourself. Your creative muscles are at their strongest right now, so whether you’re debuting a beautiful new project or just starting out with a blank canvas, bringing some artistic beauty into the world will bring you a sense of real satisfaction today. It isn’t about perfection, but about being expressive, so free yourself from expectation and do whatever feels right.","Your home could feel a bit like a battlefield today, but that doesn’t mean you can’t come out the victor. A family member or roommate might try to push your buttons, but if you hold your ground while still maintaining your trademark gift of fairness, you will be able to reach an outcome that works for all parties. However, if no drama flares up, this is still a great time for a shakeup at home; try moving around your furniture for a fresh feel.","Keep your ear to the ground and your eyes peeled because some very interesting information could find its way to you today.

Don’t blow the bank on shiny objects that will lose their luster overnight, rather, something special that will withstand the test of time.","You’re being given the green light to speak your mind today, and while that is all well and good, it is important to remember just how powerful your words can be. If speaking your truth means hurting someone in the process, especially unnecessarily, then you might have reason to question the nature of your ""truth."" However, if you think before you speak and you find you are indeed in the right, then your words could create positive and lasting change right now. Say what needs to be said.","You might have trouble sleeping right now, or find that there is a dull ache at the back of your mind throughout the day. There is a lot of energy building up just off the periphery where you can’t quite see it or understand it, making it all a bit overwhelming. Instead of trying to forge ahead right now, focus on self-care and be sure to take time to meditate. All that energy could transform into something useful if you let it lie for a bit.","When was the last time you checked in with the people in your life? Not your family or your nearest and dearest, but the wider circle of friends and acquaintances you might have lost touch with while you’ve been off celebrating the holidays. If any connections have fallen to the wayside, this is the perfect time to pick up the phone or meet up for a chat; it will do wonders for your soul to get together with a group of people to talk about old times."
2021-01-05,"The day starts on a harmonious note thanks to the Moon's entry into loving Libra at 12:42 am EST, orienting our focus toward the special people in our lives.

Although there might be a small sense of disappointment in the afternoon as the Moon opposes wounded Chiron, it should be brief, so don't lose hope.","Make a point to spend time with the people who matter most to you today. This is a terrific time to link up with some friends for a late morning brunch or even a double date.

Make a point of crossing all your t’s and dotting all your i’s, because people are paying attention and you’ll want to be at your peak performance as they watch you work your magic. A VIP or superior might finally recognize you for all the effort you’ve been putting in. If there hasn’t been much opportunity for advancement, keep your eyes peeled because it could arrive today when you least expect it.","Go out and enjoy yourself to the best of your abilities today. This is a great time to indulge in some exciting experience or creative activity that is much more about fun than anything else. In the morning, you might find yourself feeling especially philosophical, so if your brain decides to do some cross-cultural jogging, pay attention -- it is tapping into what you really want. If Bali or Paris calling your name, start your journey now by mapping it out with a vision board!","The urge to stay in bed longer than normal might strike this morning; you'd rather lie and ponder than get up and go. It’s a wonderful time to do some deep diving into the things you really want. No, not in a material sense, but in a deep, soulful sense. What are you yearning for? You can find out the answers to these questions alone, but it may be easier if you call up a friend or loved one to help you along.","You may find yourself very busy today, so if it has taken some time for you to rub the last remnants of holiday haze out of your eyes, this morning will certainly feel like a wakeup call. Even if you have nothing on your plate, this is a wonderful time to get your life in order and focus on the things you would like to achieve in the year to come. You’re great at processing information alone, but a close friend or loved one might make the processing all the more enjoyable.","It's time to get down to brass tacks. If there are any outstanding tasks or unchecked boxes clamoring for your attention, make them your first priority today. Once you’ve gotten out of bed, done some stretching, and have a cup of coffee in your system, fix your focus on the work in front of you. It might not be the most exciting thing to do, but you will plow through it faster than usual, so put your nose to the grindstone and get it done.","Feel free to do as you please today. Whether that means spending time with someone special or just puttering around the house for a few extra hours, you’ve got cosmic clearance to answer to no one but yourself. If you’re a creative Libra, then today is a wonderful time to flex your artistic muscles. A bit of painting or free writing will do wonders for your spirit and could lead you down a beautiful rabbit hole you never even knew existed.","You might feel a little out of it today, but instead of trying to fight this fogginess, lean into it and choose to take life in the slow lane. With so much energy percolating off in the wings of your subconscious, you’ll feel more at peace spending the day by yourself and hanging out around home than in trying to be social or working your magic on the job. Just do you for now, then get back to others in a few days.","This is a wonderful day to try and help others. There are plenty of reasons why it is a good thing to do some community service work here and there -- any kind of work that isn’t about helping ourselves -- but today, you can actually help yourself a lot by helping someone else. At the very least, you’ll have a really wonderful time and probably meet a lot of interesting people, so raise your hand and volunteer.","You can accomplish wonderful things today -- in fact, you can climb even higher mountains than usual under today’s stars. Early in the day, a chance to make some major money might come your way, perhaps in the shape of a raise for a job well done. But even if gold doesn’t start raining down from above, you can be sure the effort you put in now will be noticed and rewarded down the road. As always, give it your all.","You’ve never been one to stick to the tried and true, but if there has ever been a day to look beyond your usual comfort zone, this would be it. Even if you can’t go very far physically, do your best to travel mentally, perhaps with the help of Google or Wikipedia. Being an armchair traveler will bring you a lot of satisfaction, so crack open a travel guide and start planning your next big adventure, one which is nothing like anything you’ve done before.","Lean into the unusual today... Although you’ve never had much difficulty with that before, indulging in esoteric topics like spirituality or mysticism will be especially rewarding right now. If you haven’t taken the time to get in touch with your spiritual self recently, it’s time to turn that around. Whether just spending five minutes giving meditation a try or looking into more intense practices, take a moment away from the hectic whirl of life and just be. You’ve always been quite good at that, Pisces."
2021-01-06,"We get off to a rough start as the emotional Moon forms a tough square to the willful Sun. What we want to do and what we have to do probably won’t come into an easy alignment at first. Thankfully, we are blessed with some patience and practicality as action planet Mars finally moves into Taurus at 5:27 pm EST, after spending the last six months in Aries. We should take things at a slow and steady pace now. Be the tortoise rather than the hare.","You’ve been pushing along for what seems like forever, and if you’re feeling a little burnt out, that is all the reason you need to take a load off and shift your priorities. Instead of giving so much of yourself, try to pull back and find ways to channel your firepower into more productive realms, such as your work and finances. If there has ever been a day to take a good, long, hard look at your budgets and bank statements, this would be it.","You’re not one to charge full steam ahead most of the time, and it wouldn’t be at all shocking if you’ve been running on fumes for some time now. That being said, Mars moves into your sign today and energy is going to start pouring your way. Instead of forcing yourself to move forward with only the most limited drive, you’re going to go from zero to 60 at the drop of a hat. It’s time to focus on what you want and go after it without hesitation.","You’re a sign that generally loves the go-go-go and keeping your social life in the air like a volleyball at the beach. As fun as that is, though, it is sometimes important to pull back from the hectic whirlwind of life and focus on you and your own mental well-being. It’s time to clock out from the world for a while and clear your emotional decks. Where have you been holding on to outdated behaviors? Let them drift out with the tide...","The professional ladder is a steep one, yet you’ve been doing your part to climb it as fast as you can ever since Mars entered your career sector last June. Today, however, things shift as Mars moves on to more social territories, and it’s time to reconnect with the people in your life. If there is anyone you let fall by the wayside while you've been climbing mountains, then it is time to bring them back into the fold.","You’ve been trying to expand your life and your sense of self for quite a while now, and hopefully you’ve grown a great deal as a person after all the ups and downs 2020 sent your way. It’s time to take those lessons you’ve learned and those new skills and start applying them to your place in the world. You’re not the same person you were this time last year, so ask yourself, am I getting everything the new me deserves out of life?","Life has put you through the wringer for quite a while, forcing you to examine your closest bonds with people and just how effective those bonds are. This has likely required an incredible amount of energy and dedication, but thankfully, there is a major shift in your focus now as the planets encourage you to turn your gaze toward the great wide yonder. It’s time to start exploring again and see just how broad you can make your horizons. Where in the world would you like to go?","It’s one thing to establish a relationship with a person, but it is entirely something else to establish a true bond with them. While you can be quite good at bringing people into your life, sometimes you can do so a little too quickly, allowing a few less-than-desirables to slip in through the cracks. You need to start making sure everyone in your life deserves to be there, and if they aren’t pulling their weight, then it is time to cut the cord.","You are very particular about the people in your life -- you're willing to put some relationships on the back burner because you would rather have just a few good partnerships as opposed to a bunch of shabby ones. You’re right that quality is important, but sometimes you need to do a bit of digging to find the best gems. The universe wants you to do some honest digging and put in the effort now, and you could be rewarded with a real jewel of a person.","It’s time to get back in full swing, so if you haven’t yet started sketching out what you would like to accomplish this year, then get to it. What health initiatives could you incorporate into your life to make you a better version of yourself? Have you been keeping an eye on your diet or did it get thrown out the window over the holidays? There is no problem if so, but the planets are truly supporting self-improvement now, so start acting on those resolutions.","Home is where the heart is, but that doesn’t mean stress can’t live there too. You’ve probably felt like there have been too many cooks in the kitchen for a while now -- if you haven’t butted heads with at least one roommate or family member, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. Today, though, the universe is finally shifting your focus toward your exciting creative endeavors or budding love connections. You’ve paid your dues and now it is time to go have some real fun.","Busy, busy, busy; everyone seems to have had so much going on lately, yet none of them seem to have as much on their plate as you do, Aquarius. If you’re feeling close to burnout, the good news is that things are about to majorly calm down and you can take some time to just putter around the house. While you’re doing that, look around. Would a new coat of paint do wonders for you mood? How about a new sofa? A little redecoration can work miracles.","Money matters have probably been giving you a headache for quite some time, and even if you were making it just fine, it seems as though you were spending it almost as quickly as it hit your bank account. Starting today, though, you can pull back from the rat race and start focusing on the people in your life; have some relationships taken a spot on the back burner while you were trying to make it rain? Call up a sibling or a friend for a chat; you’ll be grateful you did."
2021-01-07,"The Moon is especially active right now as she dives into deep-feeling Scorpio at 3:53 am EST. Throughout the day she will form no less than half a dozen alignments to various planets in the sky, and there is nothing simple about this for anyone -- especially since most of these alignments will be tough ones. The lone exception to this is a harmonious sextile with romantic Venus, so even if life does get difficult, you can still find pockets of pleasure.","It feels like everyone wants a piece of you as the Moon enters your intense 8th House of Shared Bonds. That’s fine when you have plenty of yourself to give, but on a day like this, it might be especially difficult to find some time to go after exactly what you want when everyone else is clamoring for your attention. At the very least, focus on one thing you can accomplish, and get that one thing done.","This is an especially beneficial time to focus on your relationships. Is there a close friendship you’ve let fall by the wayside recently? Is there a coworker or business partner who could use a check-in? These people are very important to your general well-being, so don’t ignore them. You can nurture relationships like a beautiful flower, and right now there is a whole garden just waiting for you to come and give it some much needed TLC.","There is work to be done today, but it might seem as though the office (or wherever you go to make your money) is a little bit of a battleground right now. Whether it’s coworkers who keep distracting you or asking for your help or clients who never seem happy with what you do, there’s just one landmine after another to watch out for. Don’t worry; this phase is only temporary and soon you can get back to wowing everyone like usual.","Sometimes all you want is to kick off your shoes and go dance under the big blue sky, but it is at that point that everyone comes out of the woodwork to bring you back down to earth -- or your office desk. Today might feel a bit gloomy as you try to find the silver lining behind the clouds blocking your vision, but have faith they will blow away very soon and you can enjoy tomorrow with abandon.","Your home might be where your heart is, but today, it also seems to be where a lot of stress is. Thanks to the emotional Moon moving into your 4th House of Family, your focus is on the domestic scene, but her series of difficult angles to other planets means there is no peace and quiet to be had at Chez Leo. You'd be wise to take a few quick walks around the block to keep a cool head.","You tend to be better at focusing on the tasks at hand than most signs -- not many people can outperform an analytical and efficient Virgo. That being said, today it might be almost impossible to feel like you are able to check off any boxes or shore up any outstanding projects. The reason for this is you’re going to be incredibly busy, whether you like it or not, so accept today for the whirlwind it is and know that calmer skies are on the horizon.","Money matters might be a little confusing today, so you'd be smart to keep a firm grip on your wallet. Instead of browsing websites or storefronts, how about browsing your bank account and making sure everything is on the up and up? There is a good chance you might find a discrepancy or some way of cutting a few corners to save some cash. Doing a little financial detective work now will pay off down the road.","You are generally very good at controlling your emotions; in fact, that is one of the hallmarks of a Scorpio. Regardless, you might find that today, you feel as though you are being pulled in just about every direction. While everyone has something different for you to focus on, you hardly have time to focus on the things YOU want to focus on. Take a deep breath and accept that you can’t call all the shots right now, but you’ll be leading the chariot again by tomorrow.","Although you can lead the pack better than most, not to mention run farther than most, today, it’s time to take your foot off the gas and just coast along. You might feel less rested than usual, so if you are stifling yawns throughout the day, then take this as a sign to get to bed early. Finish up any chores, then treat yourself to a quiet night in followed by a decent eight hours, if not more.","No matter how much you'd like to focus on your personal goals, you may find you are too busy dealing with other people to be working your way up life's ladder today. Instead of trying to finish an important project or earn a promotion, you will probably have lots of little fires to put out in your friend group, whether it’s stamping out a rumor or helping someone through a difficult time. Friendship isn’t the easiest thing in the world, but the rewards are worth your effort.","You can keep cool with the best of them, but today, don’t be shocked if you find yourself feeling a little exposed on the professional front. Perhaps a boss or VIP turns the spotlight on you when you were least expecting it, or a call from a family member or friend leaves you trying to balance your workload with being your usual helpful self. Do your best to juggle, but if you have to bow out from something, try to do it gracefully.","You have permission to take a big, deep breath today, and turn away from the more intense matters that have been distracting you lately. The emotional Moon is moving into your 9th House of Foreign Cultures and Higher Learning, giving you a wonderful opportunity to broaden your world. If things have felt stuffy, it’s time to open a window and let in some air, and, preferably, some ideas that’ll expand your mind. Read a book or watch a documentary; you’ll feel much better when you’ve learned something."
2021-01-08,"Thinking patterns, love languages, and our deepest feelings are all subject to change today as two heavenly bodies shift signs. Messenger Mercury will move into free-thinking Aquarius, inspiring collaboration and opening our minds to brilliant ideas, while Venus dances her way into serious Capricorn for a 3-week phase of buttoned-up love and pleasure. Meanwhile, the primal Sun's supportive sextile to dreamy Neptune at 11:53 am EST means there’s never been a better time to put on some rose-colored glasses and take in the beauty around you.","You’ve been pushing ahead up the ladder for so long that you might have lost touch with some of the people in your life. Taking a break from chasing your goals for a while to reconnect with friends and loved ones will make you remember how many people adore you and enjoy your company. If you feel like you’ve outgrown a certain friend group, now is the time to spread your wings and see if you can find a tribe more in line with who you are.","Your ruler, sociable Venus, is dancing into your expansive 9th House of Faraway Places and Higher Learning today, encouraging you to seek out relationships that fulfill you on a mental and spiritual level, not just an emotional or physical one. People who can teach you something about the world will be incredibly appealing now, be it academic, cultural, esoteric, or all of the above. With Mercury moving into your career sector today as well, you’re primed to start ascending to new heights, near and far.","This is a day to take note of as your ruler, Mercury, shifts into your expansive 9th house for an extra-long tour that will include a retrograde phase in the weeks to come. Until then, you should focus on expanding the ways you think and learning about as many new things as you possibly can. Think about taking an online course about a foreign culture that has always intrigued you or starting a new meditation practice that can bring you more peace of mind.","Try to link up with someone who can expand your horizons today; it doesn’t matter if this person is a friendly, romantic, or professional relation, as long as they make a good adventure partner. If you can visit a museum or an art gallery that would be wonderful, as you’ll feel especially inspired by the beautiful masterpieces, but watching a documentary or listening to a podcast could have the same effect. You can do things on your own, of course, but you’ll have more fun with a plus-one.","Your work life is going to be more enjoyable than usual, whether you go to an office to earn your paycheck or you work from home. Easygoing Venus starts shining her light on your daily grind today, and she wants to remove any obstacles or shifty relations with coworkers. Even if you don’t care much for the people you work with, they’ll be more copacetic than usual and any difficult clients or customers will start to change their tone.","This is a wonderful day to flex your creative muscles. Whether it’s painting, music, writing, or any other artistic pleasure, take some time out of your usual program to listen to the call of the Muse and see what you can come up with. Art can be incredibly therapeutic, and if there is any sign that can get a little tightly wound, it would be you, Virgo. Even if you just crack open a coloring book and doodle for an hour, it will do wonders for your spirit.","Are you getting a little tired of that couch? Could your walls use a new coat of paint? You’re more aesthetically inclined than most signs, and right now the universe wants you to turn your attention toward your home and hearth. Whether you decide to do a total renovation or just roll out a new carpet, a bit of a change around the house will give you a huge boost. Start searching out inspiration and let your eye for style lead the way.","It's quite possible that you and the people you share a roof with all got a little too close for comfort over the holidays. If any feathers have been ruffled, then this is a great day to extend an olive branch. If you live alone, maybe this wasn’t much of a problem for you, however, that singularity may not be bringing you the same satisfaction it normally does. Don't hesitate to reach out to a friend. It’s time to bring others closer rather than push them away.","If you managed to spend a little more than you intended over the holidays, there is good news today that will bring some much-needed relief to your bank account. Venus, the planet of money, is entering your financial sector, giving you a magic touch when it comes to making your cash flow work for you twice over. If you want to find a new source of income, start looking now; a plum position with your name on it could pop up in the weeks to come.","When was the last time you indulged? Obviously, the holidays just came and went, so you have hopefully gotten to enjoy your fair share of fun. Today's energy, however, is about putting yourself first, satisfying all your own pleasures as opposed to making sure everyone else is having a good time. Beautiful Venus' entry into your sign encourages you to give yourself a bit of an upgrade. Whether that means a new face cream, a different hairstyle, or a wardrobe overhaul, the goal is to feel good.","Things might have felt a little bit fuzzy over the last few weeks; you’ve probably had your fair share of partying and carousing what with the holidays in the rearview mirror. Now, it’s finally time to shake off that grogginess and start getting your life in order to make 2021 your best year ever ... or at least better than 2020. What would you like to accomplish over the next 12 months? Sit down and make a list of intentions; the universe wants to know.","The holidays were undoubtedly a busy time for you, and while you might have gotten in a few days just to yourself when you could focus on recharging your batteries, there’s still a bit of a lagging energy hanging about. Lean into that vibration and take your foot off the gas for a bit; instead of trying to dive head-first into any new projects, focus on tying up loose ends and bringing old projects to a close. It’s time to clear the decks."
2021-01-09,"There’s a balancing act in the stars above today. The emotional Moon bounds into free-wheeling Sagittarius, encouraging us to feel beyond our usual boundaries and barriers, while romantic Venus' trine to assertive Mars welcomes us to wear our hearts on our sleeves. However, this expansive energy is countered by messenger Mercury coming into exact alignment with sober Saturn, bringing our thought processes right back down to earth. Turn over any unexamined stones; some very interesting ideas are waiting to be discovered.","Your social circle is in the spotlight today as a friend or a group of friends brings some issues your way. This could be an effort to weed out a gossiping snake or come to terms with some major shifts that have occurred among you. If everyone is on the same team, that’s great and you can continue on as you please, but if there are any turncoats on Team Aries, it’s time to show them the door.","You tend to be one of the hardest working signs of the entire zodiac, and today that hard work might finally pay off. A VIP could take notice of all you’ve been doing and offer you a promotion or other opportunity that will highlight your innate ability and responsibility. If no one is paying much attention, then pick up the bullhorn yourself and start telling people what you’ve been up to; chances are, someone will hear your pitch and be more than a little interested.","Don’t push yourself too hard today in any one direction in particular. You’re working with a shorter fuse than usual and your tongue might be a little bit sharper than other people would prefer. The best course of action is to take a step back and take ten seconds before you respond to anyone, or longer if need be. If you can have the day to yourself, then so much the better; your own mind will be more comforting right now.","Money matters are rarely fun to deal with, especially when they aren’t simple, but the problem is that if you avoid them and let them fester, they tend to only get worse. Today, you need to roll up your sleeves and do some serious fact-checking, especially with regards to any credit cards or other financial dealings. If your credit score isn’t all you’d hope, start figuring out what you need to do to get it where you want it; make a plan and stick to it.","What offers are in front of you right now? It looks like the stars are getting ready to present you with a choice of options that will have implications for a long time to come. This sounds serious and in many ways it is, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. This could turn out to be something very good, just remember to put on your thinking cap and assess it to the best of your ability before you make any final decisions.","It might be time to have a serious conversation with a coworker or client who hasn’t been pulling their weight recently. If there is any sign known for doing their fair share, it would be yours, however, you often do more than your fair share to ensure that any final product with your name on it lives up to your high expectations. Unfortunately, not everyone is on your level. Today, it’s time to make sure they are.","It’s a wonderful thing to have a hobby or some kind of creative outlet where you can let yourself go and indulge in a few hours of artistic expression. But are those projects you spend so much time on just things to pass the time, or could they be something more? Re-examine your personal skills and interests today and ask yourself, ""Can I do something important with this?"" There’s a good chance that the answer is yes.","Reconnecting with friends and old loved ones will bring you a lot of joy today, so this would be the perfect time to take a step away from your personal ambitions and, instead, focus on the special people in your life. You probably saw plenty of them over the holidays, but if any slipped through the cracks, pick up the phone and reach out now that things have started to settle down. You’ll be very happy you did.","This is a terrific day to focus on your finances -- not only focus on them, but increase your net worth. Thanks to a harmonious alignment between Mars and Venus in your work and money sectors, you could work wonders when it comes to manifesting more financial opportunities. There’s nothing wrong with asking for what you want, so if it's time you asked about a raise, consider this to be your green light from the universe to go ahead and do so.","Although your work ethic is undeniably impressive, it's important to ensure that you get your money’s worth for all the work you do. You’re not one to let yourself be taken advantage of, but right now a superior or coworker might actually have been handing you more than your fair share. There’s nothing wrong with that if you’re being properly compensated, but if not, then it is time to step up your game.","You know yourself better than everyone else -- that's just a fact of life. But how often do you actually let other people get a glimpse of the person you are on the inside? Sometimes it is necessary to stand up for yourself and make your opinions heard, and it looks as though “sometime” is today. It’s time to be vocal about who you really are, and make sure that people take notice. Your feelings matter as much as everyone else's.","You might feel like you're all over the place today, but you’ve always had a talent for going with the flow and now is the perfect time to make good use of it. Social obligations might come calling one minute, then work comes clamoring for your attention the next. As freeing as it may feel to just toss your work in the trash, check off any necessary boxes and then you can truly enjoy yourself the rest of the day."
2021-01-10,"There’s conflict between what we want to achieve and how far our energy levels can actually take us today. The intuitive Moon forms a tense square with dreamy Neptune at 1:29 pm EST, throwing us off course as a fog is cast over the landscape. Still, there's a valuable message here if we tune into the deeper vibrations and listen to our inner voice. As the Moon also aligns with the karmic Nodes, we should follow the path that feels most fulfilling.","Are your words getting your ideas across properly, or are you adding so many bells and whistles that your message gets lost in the process? Take some time to consider what you truly want to convey to people and whether or not you’re doing a good job of being clear in that aim. If you’ve been spinning around in esoteric territory, it would be best to choose a simpler path; people respond more to simple ideas than complicated ones.","As the sign that rules finances and material goods, you tend to think you have these issues pretty solidly worked out; it's often easy for you to go with the flow when it comes to such things because you know on a deep level that you’ve got this. However, today you would be smart to question that assurance and take a double look at your earning and spending habits. Saving a few dollars will be well worth it.","Although you realize that two heads are better than one and you excel at teamwork, it’s important that you learn to work just as efficiently on your own as with someone else. This is a wonderful time to focus on your own self-reliance. If you choose to ask someone to help you with something, make sure you only do so after you attempt to achieve it on your own. There's a well of independence in you waiting to be tapped.","How do you measure your value? Do you look at all the things you’ve accomplished and take satisfaction from that? Does it come from your relationships? Is it the money in the bank? Sometimes we let things have more impact on our self-worth than they should, such as material success. Today, take some time out from the rat race and remind yourself of your innate values -- the kind that aren’t measured by other people or dollar signs. You’re worth a lot.","As a confident Leo, you tend to know what you want, when you want it, and how you want it. There’s nothing wrong with knowing what you like, but sometimes pursuing your own desires can alienate you from the people in your life, especially if you push your agenda so hard that theirs gets shoved off the map altogether. Don’t forget to take other people’s opinions into account right now, or people could feel you don’t take them into account, period.","You can take care of others better than most because you know what people need, even if they don’t know it themselves. That’s one of the wonderful things about being an efficient, analytical Virgo. But you’re so busy making sure everyone else is meeting their own potential, it’s now time to ensure that you, yourself, are achieving everything you can. Put others aside today and just focus on your solo climb. You’ll be able to go far if you do.","When was the last time you really tried to make something of yourself? Not in terms of finances or career, but in terms of your mental prowess -- the kind that can only be gained by dedicating yourself to a subject or discipline and sticking with it until you are internally changed for the better. It’s time to try and improve yourself from the inside out, as opposed to the other way around. Improve yourself and you will improve your life.","When was the last time you sat down with your financial records and made sure everything was in tip-top shape? It’s hardly the most exciting way to spend a day, but there is a chance some charge or transaction might have gone through unnoticed, and a bit of sleuthing could save you from getting in trouble down the road with creditors and the like. An ounce of care is worth a pound of prevention, and even more when money is involved.","As an optimistic Sagittarius, you tend to go for the gold, searching out an end goal and propelling yourself toward it until you either reach it or get bored, whichever happens first. But while you are very used to following your own program and doing as you see fit, it wouldn’t be a bad idea today to do a bit of crowd sourcing to see if anyone else has some suggestions. The peanut gallery could be very useful to you.","It’s one thing to wow your bosses every chance you get, but are the people you work with at the same level just as impressed with you, or are they a little tired of your showing off? That’s not to accuse you of doing so, but Capricorns can be so concerned with getting to the top that they can occasionally run over people on their way there. Today, make sure you haven’t run over anyone and sparked some resentment. Success is sweeter when you have others to share it with.","Your passionate concern for the greater good is admirable; your attempts to create fairness and democracy make everyone feel that they are valuable and being heard. Right now, though, it would be best if you actually catered to your own desires and wants instead of taking a poll to see what the rest of the group would prefer. There's no need to answer to anyone else at this time; you have cosmic permission to do as you please.","It looks as though you’ve been putting in a lot of effort lately, most likely into your work life, but you’ve probably also been giving your fair share to your friends and loved ones. People love how nurturing and giving you can be, but right now, the stars are encouraging you to take a step back from the hectic whirl and just feather your own nest for a bit. Rearrange some furniture, do some cleaning, and get back to everyone else in a day or two."
2021-01-11,"Our productivity is high and we are eager to expand what we know today. The Moon enters efficient Capricorn at 8:30 am EST, turning our attention toward achievements and accomplishments. But things won’t be all business, because the Moon moves on to an alignment with pleasure-loving Venus in the afternoon, inviting us to kick back and have fun. Meanwhile, as messenger Mercury meets up with expansive Jupiter, thinking outside the box can bring us to heights we never before imagined.","You can progress by leaps and bounds on the professional front today, so if you’ve been encountering roadblocks, have faith that those will soon begin to disappear. A VIP or other superior could finally take notice of all the hard work you’ve been doing; even if you haven’t exactly been chipping away at any major project, it wouldn’t be surprising if you still find a moment to shine in the spotlight. Therefore, take some extra time with your appearance before you go anywhere!","Although your sign isn’t known for being very competitive or ruffling a lot of feathers, every once in a while, it wouldn’t hurt to blow your own horn and make people aware of just how capable you are. That isn’t to say you should make an unnecessary fuss, but if you have been hanging out on the sidelines, not drawing any attention to yourself or your accomplishments, this is a good time to finally step out and show people what you've got.","You’ve always had a lot to say and, while not everything that comes out of your mouth is exactly profound or needs to be underlined, you can indeed come up with some real gems when you put your mind to it. Take the day to mine your mind and think about how far you’ve come over the last year and how much you have developed. Chances are, there’s a revelation or two waiting for you just on the other side of self-reflection.","You could receive a major windfall if you play your cards right today. This sounds like a fairy tale or simple fantasy, but actually, it looks as though something you have been waiting on for a very long time could finally pay off -- something you are going to enjoy very, very much. If you’ve been putting in your effort, then you have nothing to fear and everything to hope for. Go forth and manifest a miracle; it’s your time.","You're no stranger to being at the top thanks to your competitive spirit. But while being first in everything is fine for a while, if you’re all alone up there, what is the point? Today, you ought to focus on the important people in your life and remind them of just how much they mean to you. If, however, you feel there aren’t that many special people in your life, then start looking, because someone could easily appear on the horizon now.","If you've been thrown off your usual habits and routines as of late, no one could really blame you. After all, the holidays are a time when people generally let themselves off the hook; however, Virgos aren’t really prone to letting themselves off the hook, and certainly not easily, either. If you feel like you’ve been slacking, now is a great time to set some intentions and get back in shape, whatever that means to you. Hop to it!","Life has been rather intense lately, and during the holidays you probably had to make things about everyone else and not yourself. Today, though, you have cosmic license to do as you please, so make some noise and draw a little attention to yourself. Creative pursuits will be incredibly fulfilling, as expressing yourself is paramount right now. Go on and show the world all the incredible talent you’ve got; this isn’t the time to hide your light.","Things could feel a little hectic around the house today, so if you need to find a moment to slip away, then do so without feeling any sense of guilt. Life is about balance and compromise, and while you know it’s important to be fair and understanding, that doesn’t mean it is always easy. Bow out from any difficult conversations you don’t want to engage in and just focus on yourself and your needs for now. You can get back to people tomorrow.","It’s not often that the planets come together in such a way as to recommend you do some shopping; especially now, in light of the recent holidays. Today, however, it looks as though you could come across a really terrific deal online if you take the time to do some browsing; it's entirely possible you will find something you’ve always wanted for a majorly discounted price. Smart spending rather than splurging is the way to financial security.","There's much more that you do with your money than just spend it or save it. You may also invest it, donate it, or hide it under your mattress, but no matter what you choose, it isn’t a fixed entity that you have no control over -- it can grow or deplete depending on how responsible and inventive you are. Everyone knows how responsible a Capricorn can be, so now, go on and show them how inventive you can also be.","Things might feel a little bit fantastical to you today. While you tend to prefer to deal with the here and now, the concrete and factual, right now you're encouraged to move into the slow lane and coast along, looking at all the pretty colors. Spend some time listening to music or drawing or just letting yourself dance in your bedroom with no one watching; letting loose a little will be good for your mission in the long run.","You have so much to gain from your relationships with others. While you shouldn’t size up people you know based on how much they can give you, right now, if you look at people with a slightly more perceptive eye, you can start to see just how much they truly enrich your life. At the same time, you may realize there are some people who truly do not enrich your life. It’s time to separate the wheat from the chaff and leave behind that which no longer serves you."
2021-01-12,"The day starts on a rather jarring note as cosmic communicator Mercury forms a tense square with rebellious Uranus at 10:00 am EST. We need to watch our words and make sure our mouths don’t run away with us. If we take the time to let in some insight, though, this can be a very enlightening moment. The mood eases up in the afternoon as the Moon forms a supportive angle to dreamy Neptune; our minds should be allowed to wander to develop the insights that arose earlier.","Don’t be surprised if work is the last thing you want to focus on today, yet, despite your deepest desires, it looks as though your responsibilities will still come calling. Instead of letting yourself get bogged down in routine and repetition, try to add a creative flare to your work, whatever that means to you. Change up your usual program and you’ll find the work in front of you flies by incredibly quickly, leaving the rest of the day open to fun.","When was the last time you showed people how innovative you are? These days you are more open to change than usual, willing to try new paths and approaches. Today, apply this fresh take to your professional life. While your coworkers and bosses might think they know exactly what to expect from you, show them a different side of yourself. Whether it's your energy, your decisions, or your reactions, it looks as though they’ll be impressed with your performance.","Messages could come to you out of the blue today, so record your dreams first thing upon waking, because there might be a clue hidden in amongst your REM cycles. Take some time to journal, giving your brain the freedom to wander where it pleases; you could wind up somewhere very inspired without even meaning to get there and, before you know it, you’ve got a whole new project ready and raring to go. Lean into the fantastical and the magical more than ever.","People might have you on edge right now when you’d rather just shut the curtains and keep to yourself. It’s fine to take time to be alone, but don’t snap at anyone in order to get it; diplomacy is in short supply thanks to a tense angle overhead, so try to keep an even keel no matter who or what comes knocking. Someone may tell you something that throws you, but you’ll bounce back if you respond carefully.","Your career is likely to demand your attention today, even if you’d rather be off doing something more exciting than checking off the usual boxes. While it might seem like a slog at first, if you try to switch up your usual approach to matters, it could actually benefit you in the long-run. Consider the professional path you’ve been on for some time; is it going in exactly the direction you want? If not, it’s time to adjust your course.","Your ideas could clash with someone else’s today, and while you want to stick to your guns because you tend to know better than most, you’ll want to be careful that this doesn’t lead to an all-out argument. Your workplace (or wherever you make your money) could be more than a bit of a war zone right now, and people will be unusually quick to bump up against anything you’re trying to do. Give everyone some space, yourself included.","Let yourself have some fun today, but make sure you keep an eye on your spending and a tight grip on your wallet. You’re more than a little prone to blowing the bank right now on something that, although nice and shiny, probably won’t prove that much satisfaction in the long run. If you find something you can’t live without, give yourself a few days to consider before you make a purchase. Buying too early could result in your missing out on a better deal.","You might have a hard time keeping your feelings to yourself today, so if you’d rather not turn on the water works in front of people, then perhaps it would be best to take a few steps back and keep your distance. People’s words are going to hit closer to home than usual and, even if they mean absolutely no harm, it is likely you’ll find an edge to their tone. This is just temporary, though -- you won’t need to be a hermit forever.","Watch your words right now more than usual; your sign is known for being the truth-teller of the zodiac, but if you do too much truth-telling today, it could bounce back to bite you. While it’s important to use discretion in general, you need to be especially careful what you say to anyone you work with in any professional capacity, as those words carry a different kind of weight. Be wise; once it comes out of your mouth, you can't take it back.","If any really exciting opportunities come your way today, you should absolutely pursue them, but not at the expense of your commitments and responsibilities. Wake up early and check off any mandatory boxes, then give yourself the day to indulge in hobbies, hang out with friends, or whatever else brings you deep satisfaction. You can be both responsible and playful under today’s energies, so have at it, because if any sign could use a break, it would be yours.","You’ve got a lot to say today, even if you normally prefer to keep a lid on it. But while there are many interesting things going on in your mind, make sure you consider your message and how your words will be received by those around you. It’s all too easy to ruffle people’s feathers right now, and when you’ve got a lot on your mind like this, it’s important you don’t inadvertently scare off or offend your audience.","The line between reality and fantasy is very thin right now. Although you tend to enjoy dipping your toe into any wonderland you pass by, today, both the reality and the fantasy will be a little less appealing and a little more unsettling than you might prefer. If it seems that one person after another keeps trying to distract you with trivial matters, do your best to keep calm and collected, because shirking your duties isn’t going to solve any problems at the moment. Stay your course."
2021-01-13,"A transformative New Moon in goal-oriented Capricorn right at 12:00 am EST sets the stage for a major window of opportunity and manifestation. Things might start off slow, however, as action-planet Mars forms a combative square with karmic Saturn, reminding us to cross our t’s and dot our i’s before rushing forward with any plans. Meanwhile, a heartfelt surprise could happen in the evening, as pleasure-loving Venus forms a harmonious trine with rebellious Uranus, encouraging us to change up the way we express our feelings of love.","Get ready to change your status in the world; thanks to this morning’s incredibly powerful New Moon in Capricorn, your career aspirations and other long-term goals are going to be the main focus now. What's more, because this lunation is at nearly the exact same degree as transformative Pluto, you can be sure this moment is going to be very impactful, to say the least. It is time to go after what you really want out of life and stop letting other people take the spotlight.","There might be some constrictions today as motivational Mars in your sign forms a tough angle with karmic Saturn in your career sector. While these two planets normally want to help you progress along, with the tough energy between them, you may take one step forward, only to take quite a few steps back. A VIP or boss might ask more than you’d like, but keep a lid on your feelings and don’t blow up at the wrong person. Keep your solid reputation intact.","Although you’re very good at bringing in new acquaintances, like bees to a flower, how often do these relationships go beyond just surface level? It's nice to have a lot of people in your life, but you would benefit from the closeness and support of some more established connections. Today, do a deep dive with someone in your life and see how far you can go together. Open up to people and show them who you are at the core.","Yours is an innately emotional sign, perhaps the most emotional sign of the zodiac. Although you realize you are responsible for your emotions up to a certain point, someone special could have a major impact on your feelings today, but it looks as though it will be very much for the better. This isn’t about romance -- it could be a coworker, a friend, a sibling -- rather about how much you let people support you. Let down those walls.","You might find that no matter how hard you try to progress at work today, your actions are being impeded by someone else. Perhaps your boss keeps giving you meaningless busy-work tasks when you’d rather sink your teeth into something serious, or maybe a coworker keeps disrupting your flow as they constantly ask for assistance. However it plays out, take a deep breath and accept that the career ladder isn’t going to be an easy climb on a day like this.","Few people can actualize a concept or an idea quite like a Virgo, and all that ability is being thrust in the spotlight today thanks to the beautiful New Moon in Capricorn illuminating your 5th House of Creativity. Whether you choose visual arts, performance, or writing, now is the time to show the world how much talent you’ve been hiding. Since transformative Pluto is orbiting exceptionally close to this New Moon, current projects could have a major impact on your future for years to come.","Although you are naturally welcoming and open with others, today you may question just how much of yourself you want to share. Do you reveal everything up front or play your cards close to your chest? Someone might appear in your life now who makes you question your usual friendly ways, so you would be wise to be on guard. When in doubt, play it safe by keeping to yourself. If trust later becomes established, you can always revamp your approach.","Don’t let anyone push your buttons today -- if you can help it, that is. Thanks to a tough angle between motivational Mars and sober Saturn, you might find the clear path to progress is blocked by an emotional minefield, and while no minefield is ever fun, an emotional one is just about your least favorite kind. Step very carefully right now, because both you and others are prone to blowing sky-high at the lightest touch. Keep your feet on the ground.","You’re not one to get stuck in a rut often, but it looks as though you may be a bit stuck financially now. It’s time to re-examine your money and how you make it. Are you being adequately compensated for the work you do, or could it be better? Could you do a better job, or maybe even a different one, and earn more? Spruce up your resume today as you weigh your options; the universe is getting ready to send you new opportunities.","You get a second New Year’s celebration today thanks to the beautiful New Moon happening in your sign. This is like a universal refresh, giving you the chance to change up your approach to life both in how you present yourself and how you engage with others. Is it time for an update? Even a haircut can make you feel like a new person, so perhaps it’s time to try on a different look. Embrace this opportunity for a new beginning.","Do you have any bad habits? The answer is probably yes, even if you don’t want to admit it, but identifying the issue is the first step to solving it. Right now, you need to look at yourself with a critical eye and parcel out your behavior; what isn’t serving you? What is holding you back? Focus on releasing these outdated ways and you’ll be able to make major progress in the future. You need to let go of the old so there's room to let in the new.","Busy, busy, busy; there are so many people clamoring for your attention today that it might feel impossible to actually get anything done. It would be best if you don’t make a long to-do list for yourself, since you probably won’t be able to check off half of the items. Instead of putting forth futile efforts, accept today for what it is and give yourself permission to relax and accomplish less. No one else is achieving much either, so don’t worry that you’ll get left behind."
2021-01-14,"There’s major change in the wind as Uranus, the planet of surprises, turns direct at 3:36 am EST. New opportunities begin to arise now that can help us grow and transform into the best version of ourselves. We should pay attention to the messages in our dreams as the sensitive Moon conjuncts communicator Mercury just an hour later. Whatever it is we are striving for, with today's alignment between the Sun and powerful Pluto, we won't take ‘no’ for an answer.","Get ready to change the way you make your money, or at least how you spend it. Rebellious Uranus wakes up from a 5-month retrograde phase today in your 2nd House of Income and Material Possessions, encouraging you to dust off your approach to finances and look at them with an innovative eye. Although money is a basic, real-world concern, our relationship with it runs deep. Your deepest held beliefs are ready to change, though, so releasing these old habits will comes easier now.","Although you are known for staying the course, with change-maker Uranus spending time in your sign, you've probably been going through more changes than usual lately. As Uranus turns direct today after five months in retrograde, you can expect to be presented with some personal revelations in the near future that could alter the entire way you see yourself. The more open you are to seeing and doing things in new ways, the more you will benefit from this impactful moment.","Your dreams are especially prophetic right now, so if they seem more vibrant than usual, that’s probably for a reason. Wake up early and try to record as much of them as you can in a dream journal, or get one started if you don't have one yet. The more you record your dreams, the easier it is to remember them, and there are a lot of messages coming to you from out of the blue now -- messages you’ll absolutely want to remember in full.","Do you feel that you genuinely fit in with your friends? How about the broader social circles you interact with? Do these people reflect your deepest values? Sometimes you can get stuck interacting with the same people because it’s comfortable and what you’re used to, but what is familiar is not what's best right now. Choose change over comfort. Size up the people in your life to see if you truly align; don’t be cruel, but do be critical.","You tend to know what you want out of life more than most, and having your eye fixed so firmly on the ball is an admirable trait. The problem, however, is that every so often you lock yourself into a goal that doesn’t actually reflect what you want, but you’ve been chasing it for so long that you still go after it. Take some time today to re-evaluate your goals in life. Where do you genuinely want to be?","When was the last time you made a point to think outside of the box? As a grounded Earth sign, you can sometimes get a little stuck in your ways, but the planets are encouraging you to change up your thinking patterns and usual approach to matters. The best way to do this is to actively learn something new; sign up for an online course or crack open a book on a subject that’s always fascinated you. Broadening your horizons will broaden your value.","Your buttons may be pushed today by a spouse, parent, roommate, or someone else you share a roof with. While the best advice with this kind of situation is normally to take a break and get some space, right now, it would actually be best if you engage with this button-pusher and hop head first into the conflict. You can move mountains under today’s powerful energy, but all those mountains are going to be within your own four walls.","A little change to your environment can turn out to be a huge push forward in the right direction now. It doesn’t take much to shift the energy in your surroundings: a fresh coat of paint on the walls, a new rug, or updated throw pillows can help to re-energize the space where you spend so much of your time. Your home needs to reflect you as much as possible, so look around today and ask yourself, how can I make my space more ‘me?’","Wake up early to get in some exercise because it’s time to streamline your life and implement new habits that will help you become the lean machine you can be. It’s easy enough to get in a slump with one workout or another, so if you’re burned out on yoga or swimming or running, mix it up with something you’ve never tried before, like a self-defense class or modern dance workshop. It’ll do you good to get your blood pumping.","There's nothing wrong with living life by the book, but every once in a while, you would be wise to throw that book out the window and try moving things around. It’s very smart of you to have a contingency for everything, but some spontaneity could create opportunities that you wouldn't have access to any other way. Do things differently right now than you normally would, and you’ll find that the experience is surprisingly beneficial and satisfying.","You don’t like being told what to do and you especially don’t like being forced to conform to anyone else’s standards. Unfortunately, we can’t always do as we please and there are times when it is necessary to compromise for the good of the group. Today, though, the planets are giving you their blessing to put your own desires front and center, without consulting anyone else first if they are on board. You do you, Aquarius; it’s your time.","Your dreams might stick around longer than usual today, so if it feels like there is something tickling your brain, sit down and try to figure out what it is instead of pushing it aside and going about your day. Remove yourself from the normal grind and give yourself permission to focus on some self-reflection; it looks like there is something you need to uncover, but you will have to do a little bit of digging in order to discover exactly what it is."
2021-01-15,"It's a fairly quiet day in the cosmos, for better or for worse. The intuitive Moon will spend the day zipping through the last few degrees of friendly Aquarius before diving into dreamy Pisces at 5:17 pm EST, encouraging us to bow out and take some time to ourselves. We can enjoy some light socializing, then hang up the ""do not disturb"" sign and engage in a quiet night in, maybe with someone special by our side.","Set an intention to catch up with friends early today, and maybe even call up someone you haven’t spoken to in a while. Chances are their life has changed quite a bit since you last touched base and you’ll be really impressed and inspired by what they have to tell you. Take the evening to digest this information and sit with it; ask yourself, when was the last time you impressed and inspired someone with what you’re doing?","Hit the ground running today and you'll be very thankful later on. Whatever work you’ve got in front of you, make it your first priority to get it taken care of. You’ll need to have a clear schedule in the evening so you can catch up with friends when they come calling. You’ve earned a night off, so don’t look back as you go off and pursue some much-needed fun. Even if you can’t go far, you should still go.","Spend the morning gathering information and plowing through old books or websites you haven’t perused in a while; is there a subject or specialty you used to be fluent in, but have lost touch? Reignite your mental spark, then take this boosted brain power with you as the Moon moves into your 10th House of Goals and Accomplishments in the evening. Your mind is your greatest asset, so make sure you’re using it to the best of your ability.","You might wake up in a bit of a funk and feel like talking to absolutely no one for the first part of the day, and that’s fine. Have a leisurely breakfast, don’t spend a lot of time on your phone, and take a quiet moment to meditate in order to clear away any clouds that might be darkening your horizons. You’ll feel the warmth again come the afternoon, so turn your thinking outward then and try connecting with people with a fresh attitude.","It’s a good day to get business matters sorted, so if there are any outstanding projects you still need to complete, make them your top priority and don’t stop until they are done. It’s important to get these things out of the way, because you’re going to want to spend the evening by yourself, ruminating about life. Take a step back from people and just focus on you for the time being; this is about diving deep rather than staying in shallow waters.","Start the day with some kind of exercise to get your blood pumping, preferably outside if you can. If not, even a bit of yoga in your bedroom or a few minutes with a jump rope will do wonders for your spirit and help you tackle the tasks in front of you with much more ease. You’ll want to get out any excess energy so you can give 100% of your attention to more interesting matters, especially any exciting creative projects you're involved in.","You wake up with a smile on your face today. Set a positive tone for the day by listing at least three things you have to be grateful for. Then, have fun with getting dressed for wherever you’re going, and if you aren’t leaving the house, then put on some clothes just for the heck of it. When was the last time you danced around to some really loud music? You have more energy this morning than usual, so do something enjoyable with it.","You may prefer to putter around the house this morning rather than get up and get going. If you do have to hurry out the door, at least be gentle with yourself and don’t push too hard during the first few hours of the day, because you’ll be feeling rather tired and just a little bit sensitive. This mood won’t last forever, though, so you can expect to shake it off and have some fun come the afternoon.","Don’t be surprised if you wake up to a bunch of emails and texts waiting for your attention first thing. The day starts off on a busy note and you’ll be bearing the brunt of it, so get a fresh cup of coffee and get down to work. Things will blow over by the afternoon, so no need to worry this pace will continue; then again, if anyone can thrive during a fast-paced day, it would be you, Sagittarius.","Treat yourself to a bit of luxury this morning, even if only in small ways. Take some extra time in the shower with a nice body wash, get a pastry from your favorite bakery, and if you have work in front of you, try to find a way to make it feel less regimented and routine. The pace will pick up come the afternoon, but why not take it easy until then? You have permission to be the tortoise today rather than the hare.","There’s a spring in your step this morning and a certain sense of lightness, like you just finished a task you’d been dreading, one which turned out to be far less difficult and dramatic than you had originally predicted. Take this sense of relief and ease with you into the day and direct it to any business matters that might require your attention; people will be very impressed with your carefree attitude, so go ahead and charm their socks off.","You might need a few more cups of coffee than usual to get yourself raring to go this morning. Everything feels sleepy and dreamy as your bed beckons you back under the covers. This lull won’t last all day, though -- you’ll finally start to feel like yourself again in the afternoon, so try to push any meetings or appointments to the second half of the day and give yourself permission to take the morning nice and slow."
2021-01-16,"It’s a soft and easy day as the planets take a step back from putting on any major performances and give us the chance to catch our breath. The intuitive Moon forms a harmonious sextile with friendly and loving Venus at 12:02 pm EST, casting a pleasant glow over the afternoon. Reach out to people with an open and nurturing heart. Especially these days, we could all use a little bit more kindness in our lives.","You’ve got permission to spend some extra time in bed this morning, so don’t worry about being up and at ‘em with the dawn. Normally you like to live by the motto “the early bird gets the worm,” but today, you can get the worm even if you don’t start looking until lunch time. As the Moon aligns with Venus in your career sector, you could reach a high point at work, and it looks like it won’t require much effort to get there.","Don’t be surprised if you have no interest in mundane matters today -- most of your work can probably wait, your finances don’t need to be gone over with a fine-tooth comb, and any outstanding chores can hang out on the back burner. The universe wants you to fully enjoy yourself today, in a manner that is rewarding and fulfilling. Flex your creative muscles or start learning about a new subject you’re passionate about; focus on increasing your personal value instead of your financial value.","You’ve got your sights set high right now and today's energies give you every reason to run for the tallest peak. While pleasure-loving Venus in your sector of shared resources is boosting the Moon in your professional sector, you could make a major impact with your work and, in turn, receive a major windfall for your efforts. Don’t expect a basic pay raise, but rather a single lump sum or bonus that will make it all worth it.","Set an intention to be honest with yourself today, and also honest with the people in your life. Have you been putting in more than your fair share? Are you feeling a little run down? It’s okay to voice these things to others, even if you’d normally prefer to keep such emotions to yourself. A shoulder to cry on -- or just someone to -- speak to will make all the difference now, helping you clear out any difficult emotions.","You could make a major impact at work today, so put on your best face and get cracking as early as possible. No matter how many things you have waiting, it looks as though you’ll be able to plow through them with maximum efficiency and minimal effort. Make sure to set aside some time to get in some exercise between tasks, like yoga or a nice walk to get a bit of fresh air. Light activity will help to clear your mind and sustain your energy.","With as efficient and dedicated as you are, group projects tend to be your worst nightmare because no one can ever seem to do their fair share of the work -- even when they do put in effort, it rarely meets your rather high standards. Although you'd normally just go off and do things by yourself, you might be pleasantly surprised today if you try a different approach. Not everyone is incompetent, and you could meet some very capable people today that you'll want on your side.","Some early spring cleaning may be in store today, but not just a bit of organizing or tidying up -- really try to get in the various nooks and crannies and clear out any dust that’s been building. A little bit of regimented housework will help to clear your mind and brush away old energies. Get to the tasks you don't get to often, like vacuuming under the sofa or emptying out junk drawers. You might even find something valuable you thought you had lost forever.","Don’t be surprised if you wake up with texts and emails waiting for your attention. Sometimes it can be very stressful to start your day like that, but it looks as though the information coming your way today will be more than a little wonderful. Say yes to any invitations and follow through on any outstanding opportunities; an event or hangout could lead to a night full of fulfillment, among other things. Don’t play the wallflower right now, Scorpio!","It’s a good day to get organized, yet while that might sound like a chore or busy work, it will actually fly by if you just roll up your sleeves and get to it. You could come across a problem that looks complicated at first, but don’t let it scare you. A relative or other important person in your life, particularly a female, might emerge from the woodwork with a bit of helpful advice; if not, don’t hesitate to reach out and ask for some yourself.","Focus hard on what you want to manifest because, today, it looks as though all you have to do is ask for it and the universe will bring it to your front door. You might get a very interesting text or call from someone, so if you’re the kind of person to screen your calls, now is a good time to pick up that unknown number. The messages that are coming through now can have a positive impact on your life.","Life seems to pull you in two different directions today, but this doesn't faze you. You’ve never been one to force yourself to walk the straight and narrow path, and right now you’ve got permission to bounce around as you see fit. You can be productive AND daydream, achieve AND relax, so don’t box yourself in when there is no need. In fact, your daydreams could lead to major achievement, so allow your mind to wander freely and follow up on any interesting notions.","It will be difficult to focus on your work today as people bring exciting opportunities and invitations to you left and right. You are longing for some enjoyment and should have no trouble finding it. On the other hand, if you’re feeling rather isolated, be sure to reach out to a friend for support. While the Moon in your sign positively connects with Venus in your friendship sector, it is easier to find the sense of connection you crave."
2021-01-17,"There’s a jolt of revolution in the air as expansive Jupiter squares off with rebellious Uranus at 5:50 pm EST, urging us all to act out. While it’s a great time to color outside the lines, Jupiter might push us to take this unstable energy too far, so try to maintain a sense of tact and fairness. The Moon in Pisces will sextile both transformative Pluto and the primal Sun throughout the day, so we can expect to feel these changes on a deeply spiritual level.","It would be wonderful to shake off your responsibilities and go play with your friends all day, but it looks like work is going to come calling no matter what. Uranus in your income sector is sending a tough beam to Jupiter, bringing your attention firmly back to your money and how you make it. An unexpected charge or expense might come up, so try to keep on top of your spending; if something seems like a bad idea, it probably is.","You can color outside the lines today, but that doesn’t mean you should just scribble all over. If you’re going to act out, at least try to do it in a smart way. The reason for this is that some VIPs or superiors currently have their eye on you, and while you can wow them with some unexpected genius, if you show off too much or too wildly, they might view your originality in a negative light. Whatever you do, stay authentically you.","It will feel like the universe is pulling you in two separate directions today, but if anyone can handle this kind of dichotomy, it would be you. Just take things at your own pace. If anyone tries to boss you around, then politely tell them you need your time and space. You can bounce back and forth between responsible and easygoing on a day like this, so don’t worry about living up to anyone’s expectations except for your own.","Someone might push your buttons today, and while you tend to have your buttons a little more exposed than other signs of the zodiac, that doesn’t mean you go out searching for it. In fact, it looks as though this certain button-pusher could be close to you, from within your own social group. If a friend has trouble respecting personal boundaries, be sure to nicely let them know where yours lie; maybe they just need to be reminded.","Be careful about flexing your muscles on the professional front today. An opportunity might appear out of the blue -- some sort of chance for you to make a name for yourself, or at least leave a nice mark -- but don’t jump head first into anything before you’ve had the chance to fully examine the issue in front of you. It may be that you’re missing something, and you don’t want to mess this up because you didn’t properly prepare. Take your time.","You generally tend to be one of the most responsible signs of the zodiac without question, but today, something might happen that makes you want to shake off any and all responsibilities and spend your time indulging in pursuits that nurture you on a mental and spiritual level. Clock out from mundane reality and immerse yourself in a good book or film, preferably one set in a far-off land that can inspire your wanderlust. The world is calling your name, so go on and answer.","Show off your skills today, whatever that might mean to you. Do you like to write? Start a fresh page. Like to draw? Start a new picture. You’ve got a lot of talent and an innate eye for what looks good, so even if you don’t have a specific project in mind, just get a blank surface in front of you and let the muse guide you. There’s no need to worry about the end result right now -- today, it's about the journey.","Stay close to home today if you can today, because it looks like the world is going to be treating you like a pinball, bouncing off one bumper after another, and the last thing you want is to spend all day spinning about, doing what other people want. If you have any plans that can’t be canceled, do your best to put on a brave face, then bow out as soon as possible. You’ll feel less vulnerable in a few days.","It looks like you'll be dealing with one distraction after another today. If you can hardly get through one task without your phone blowing up or another wave of emails flooding your inbox, just take a deep breath and count to ten. People are going to be clamoring for your attention whether you want them to or not, but that doesn’t mean you have nothing but time for them. Be firm about your needs, and get back to people tomorrow.","Something bright and shiny might catch your eye and, while you’re generally pretty good about maintaining a responsible approach to your spending, that rule could get thrown out the window today as you feel more of a must-have urgency. If you can afford this object, then you can go ahead, but it would still be best to take a couple days to consider whether or not you REALLY want it; that urge may evaporate sooner than you’d expect.","Don’t be surprised if someone manages to bring drama to your home front now -- even if you don’t actually live with anyone else. Whether it’s a family member calling from afar or just a friend stopping by, it looks like you and someone close to you could have a bit of a dust-up. It’s doubtful this person will be a romantic connection; rather, someone platonic or familial. Be careful about who you let in today.","It might be a little difficult for you to get your message across today, so if it seems like you stick your foot in your mouth every time you open it, perhaps it would be best to just take a step back and let others do the talking. In fact, it seems as though you could learn quite a bit right now just by staying silent. People will let slip some rather interesting details, so keep your ears open."
2021-01-18,"The sensitive Moon enters adventurous Aries at 2:07 am EST, encouraging us to lead with our hearts and the fire deep in our bellies. While this helps to push us along at lightning speed, we'd be wise to apply extra focus and efficiency. Luna aligns positively with hard-working Saturn in the morning, then bountiful Jupiter in the afternoon, so a productive morning could lead to quite a rewarding rest of the day. Put in the effort early and your future self will thank you.","When was the last time you reviewed your friend group? That isn’t to say you should go about assigning each person a grade, but relationships change, and someone who has been hanging out on the periphery of your life may actually be on the way out now. You don’t necessarily have to be the one to hold the door open for them, but it helps to keep an eye on the exit -- your awareness of this experience can teach you something.","Follow your intuition today and see where it takes you. There’s the classic idea that you need to roll up your sleeves and sweat bullets to make any real impact in life, but there’s a change in the wind right now and you could make some wonderful things happen just by taking a less direct approach. Let someone else take the wheel for now and enjoy the ride in the passenger’s seat. You could wind up somewhere really wonderful if you just stop pushing.","Connect with your friends today and ask them what they’ve been up to. Chances are you haven’t gotten to immerse yourself in other people’s lives lately, but there have been some rather interesting developments behind the scenes. Someone might tell you something that will put everything you know on a different footing -- rather than throw you off balance, though, it looks like this change can help you get to where you want to be. You’re better than most with change, and now's your chance to prove it.","There’s a clear path being laid out for you today and it is leading you toward major achievement, so get your coffee and get to work first thing. A VIP or boss might send a special assignment your way, and this assignment looks as though it will come with some rather pleasant financial strings attached. Do whatever it takes to hit this ball out of the park, because you could get a very nice reward for the effort.","Look beyond your familiar surroundings for satisfaction today. It can greatly benefit you now to try to connect with a way of life or a way of thinking that is very foreign to what you were raised with. Sometimes Leos, as Fixed signs, can get a little too stuck in their ways, so make an attempt to be a little more malleable in your thinking right now. The more open your mind is, the more giving the world is.","Keep your head down at work today, and if it seems that someone is trying to bait you, do your absolute best to take a step out of their range and stay focused on your task at hand. A coworker might take up more of your time than is fair, or perhaps a personal matter rears itself when you’re supposed to be the utmost professional. Watch your words as you handle this situation and know that clearer skies are coming.","An important relationship in your life is highlighted as the Moon travels through your 7th House of Partnerships and Contracts. This could be a romantic involvement, a business partner, or a best friend, but either way, it looks as though there is going to be a rather serious issue at hand. Pay attention to whatever comes your way today because, chances are, it’s there for a reason. What lesson is the universe trying to teach you through this experience?","The things you begin now can turn into a pattern, for better or worse. It’s an auspicious day to start a new habit, so start a good one and the rewards will follow. Consider streamlining your morning routine so you can dig in to work earlier, or adding some calming practices to your bedtime routine for better sleep. If you have a hard time sticking to a workout routine, give it another try now while there's more staying power. Whatever you begin, just take it one step at a time.","This could be an exceptionally pleasurable day for you, so whether you’ve got an empty schedule ahead of you or a thousand things on your to-do list, make a point to get in some time to kick back and do as you please. Whatever fun means to you is what you should pursue now, and if you can bring someone special along for the ride, even better. Expression and love and play are all supported now -- set yourself free.","With the amount of extra time you've been spending at home, you could greatly benefit from a change of energy in your living space, which may also be doubling as your workspace. Take some time today to do research on Feng Shui or other ways to switch up the atmosphere and energy. You’ll be surprised by how much more open your home and mood will feel just after just a few adjustments or updates. A little change is good for everyone.","There’s a lot on your plate today, but it looks as though you chose each of the things on your schedule, so you'll need to muster your energy and fulfill these commitments. It might feel hectic at first when you look at the long to-do list in front of you, but if you are smart and just focus on one thing at a time, you can get it all taken care of in a timely manner. You’re more capable than you realize, so lean into the day's responsible vibrations.","Your heart is especially open now and you may be eager to engage your altruistic side. Find a way to give back today, even if you don't have the financial means to do so. Money is only one way of offering help -- giving your time to volunteer, your skills to help a friend, or just collecting a few items for donation can mean the world to someone else. Chances are, your generous nature will also inspire others to pay it forward."
2021-01-19,"It’s an eventful day with the Moon moving through fiery Aries, but her helpful sextile to messenger Mercury casts a calming beam that will allow us to voice our deepest desires. A major shift in energy then comes at 3:40 pm EST when the Sun leaves behind serious-minded Capricorn and enters easier-going Aquarius, the sign of the visionary. The next 30 days are a time for progressive action and forward movement as the universe reminds us to look to the future.","Link up with some friends early in the morning if you can, even if it's just for a quick call -- as long as it's not so early that you wake someone up on the wrong side of the bed. The Sun's shift into your social 11th house today changes your focus from professional matters to the people you surround yourself with. Are you happy with all the players on Team Aries, or is it time for a change of lineup?","Work might come calling first thing, but if you don’t let it ruffle your feathers, you’ll be able to move mountains before you even have your first cup of coffee. The energizing Sun is moving into your professional 10th house today, putting your attention on career matters not just today, but for the next month. Be sure to put your best foot forward as you climb life’s great ladder; VIPs will be watching and they're ready to reward hard work.","The world is about to open up to you after a very constricting year, so start planning where you’d like to go. Spend the morning flipping through travel blogs, plotting out where you’d like to find yourself once travel or relocating is an option. It’s fine to revisit old, familiar locations, but new experiences will make your heart sing. Prepare yourself for the future by immersing yourself in a new culture, expanding your mind, and broadening your horizons.","It’s time to focus on your finances, and not a moment too soon. After all, you may have been prone to swiping your credit card a little too frequently during the holiday season. Carve out some space to sit down with your bank statements and make sure everything is on the up and up; a discrepancy might have been made by mistake, and you might be the one responsible. Catching it now will save you from a headache down the road.","You’re so impressive all on your own, but every once in a while, you can impress people even more when you work together as part of a team. Look around your life and ask yourself whose skills compliment your own. Who could benefit you, and you them, if you decided to partner up? Keep your eyes peeled for anyone worth their weight in gold, because the universe is going to reward dynamic duos now, and you certainly don’t want to miss out on that.","It’s time to get your life together, especially if you're still hanging out in the lazy, hazy post-holiday territory. The energizing Sun is moving into your 6th House of Health and Wellness today, so get back on whatever bandwagon you may have fallen off. Whether you need to streamline your diet, cut down on the drinking, or get more sleep, this is the day to start a new program. Dedicate yourself and, soon enough, you’ll be a lean and mean efficiency machine.","Letting your creative heart sing will do wonders for your mental health right now. Find a way to express yourself today, whether that means spending hours on an art project that's already in progress or just doing a little doodling or free-writing. Life has felt very closed off lately, but the universe is offering you a breath of fresh air today as the warming Sun enters your 5th House of Creativity and Enjoyment. Finally, you can kick up your heels and go dance in the light.","It looks as though you’ve been very busy socializing over the last few weeks, which makes perfect sense given the time of year, but now it is time to zero back in and focus on yourself and your immediate surroundings for a bit. How is your house looking? Is it a cozy place where you feel comfortable, or does it need some TLC? The energy in your living space matters these days more than ever. Give it some love and it will love you back.","Get all your ducks in a row, because the Sun enters your 3rd House of Communication and Interaction today, signaling the start of one of the busiest times of the year for you! A lot of new messages and information is ready to roll in. Take a moment to check your schedule and take care of any outstanding matters you need to attend to. You’re going to want to have a clear calendar for all the invites soon to come your way.","It’s time to roll up your sleeves and get to work before you lose any traction. While Capricorns can be very responsible by nature, you might have let yourself stray from your commonsense ways during the recent holidays. Today, however, the Sun enters your 2nd House of Finances and Values for the next 30 days, helping you kickstart a new program to get your life in order. This is especially a great opportunity to seek out new money-making and career ventures.","Get up early today if you can and face life with a new determination and fresh energy. Shake off any negative thoughts or baggage you are carrying around and leave it in the past! It’s a new day and the energizing Sun is entering your sign, offering you the chance to turn over a new leaf. Why not take this opportunity and run with it? It’s time to show the world all that you can be, but you need to show yourself first and foremost.","It is time to power down for a while as the Sun slips into your dreamy 12th House of Healing for the next month. This is a big detox period, so take today to make a list of old habits or behaviors which are no longer serving you and make a point to remove them from your life. You don’t need to change overnight, but one step in the right direction can lead you to a whole new, epic journey."
2021-01-20,"The morning hours are best spent plowing through work and checking off any outstanding boxes while the Moon is still in go-getter Aries. Once Luna moves into slow and steady Taurus at 1:55 pm EST, the energy slows down and settles in. Still, action-planet Mars and rebellious Uranus are forming a rare conjunction, encouraging us to act out of the ordinary, yet a complicated square between the Sun and Moon could make it difficult to figure out how to do this. In the end, we may even surprise ourselves.","Think about changing up your style when it comes to your finances today; your ruling planet Mars is aligning with revolutionary Uranus in your money sector, making this the perfect time to take a different approach to these matters. Whether it's how you make money, how you spend it, or how you save it, a new method could alter your financial picture for the better. You’re one of the most innovative signs out there -- make a change now that will make your future self happy.","You may feel a strong urge to break out of any boundaries today and show the world just how different you are. As surprising Uranus and motivated Mars align in your sign and your 1st House of Identity, don’t be shocked if you decide to reach for a bottle of hair dye or book an appointment at a tattoo parlor. Just be sure you actually want to make a big change and aren’t riding a temporary wave. Some decisions will be hard to revert...","Your sleep pattern might be off right now, or perhaps you found yourself twisting and turning all night without managing to get a wink of shuteye. There is a lot of action happening off in the wings where you can’t see it right now, but you can still feel it, and you can use it to your advantage. The veil between reality and fantasy is extremely thin, so do your best to zone out and try to touch base with the other side. You could learn something there...","This isn’t the kind of day to spend by yourself, so reach out and link up with some people if you can -- a few phone calls will do the trick if you can’t meet up in person. Even if you don’t make the effort, chances are people will come seeking your attention when you least expect it. Keep yourself open to the unexpected today and life could take you to some very exciting places, even if only metaphorically.","Brace for impact on the professional front today. Thanks to a rare alignment between surprise-a-minute Uranus and red-hot Mars in your career sector, something major could occur at the office (or wherever you go to make your money), and it looks like whatever happens will come completely out of the blue. Lead with your best foot forward, because people will be watching, and a good attitude and a little delicate juggling right now could wow them down the line.","Your personal beliefs are under a long-term review while revolutionary Uranus moves through your 9th House of Philosophy, altering the way you commune with the world. Today, energetic Mars meets up with Uranus, magnifying these soul-searching vibrations. By exploring different belief systems or talking to others about their perspectives, you could learn something that truly changes your outlook. Ask yourself, how is my view of the world changing these days? It’s time to incorporate those changes into your life.","Be careful about biting off more than you can chew right now. There is a combustible planetary alignment happening in your sector of shared resources today, so it looks like a matter involving the property between you and someone else (be it a person or a company) will come up for inspection. Think credit cards, taxes, and other lump-sums that you don’t earn regularly; if there’s ever been a day to play it safe in these areas, this would be it.","Your relationships are subject to major change today, specifically one-on-one partnerships. This isn’t just about romantic connections, rather anyone you have an equal relationship with, be it a close friend or coworker, as long as you are both on even footing. This person could bring some very unexpected news your way or behave in a manner that is completely unexpected and throws you off kilter. Keeping more distance between you and others is probably wisest for now.","Your workplace might be a minefield today, even if your workplace is your home, so tread carefully and keep an eye out for any saboteurs who might be hanging out in the wings. A volatile conjunction between aggressive Mars and surprising Uranus in your work sector could cause a client to push your buttons or a boss to get on your case for no reason. How you react will reflect on you, so do your best to keep your cool.","When was the last time you flexed your creative muscles? You tend to focus a lot on how something is going to turn out when it’s done, but you’ll get more out of the experience if you don’t worry about the outcome, rather just kick back, express yourself, and see what you discover. Get messy with some arts and crafts today and don’t worry about what the final result will look like. It is all about the journey right now.","It might feel like the walls are closing in on you today. If you can’t seem to get enough space or privacy, try not to blow your lid -- you are feeling more tense than usual and the last thing you want to do is explode at someone because of a passing feeling. Take a step back from people and, if need be, don’t even leave your room; you’ll feel better when the planets move on to less combustible places in a day or two.","Watch your words today, because something you say could wind up hitting someone else much closer to home than you intend; before you know it, you’ll have to apologize for something you thought was just fun and light-hearted. It’s all well and good to joke around, but if your jokes carry a bit too much truth to them, that is when you can get in trouble. Err on the safe side right now and save your sharper words for calmer days."
2021-01-21,"Although the Moon is traveling through stable Taurus today, she will form a series of powerful alignments early on, spiking our day with energy from the get-go. First is the conjunction with rebellious Uranus at 3:37 am EST, then another with fiery Mars just a half hour later, and, finally, a tense square with boundless Jupiter. With all this rambunctious energy overhead, our dreams are likely to be prophetic, but our sleep patterns may get tossed out the window. Take things one step at a time.","Wake up with a plan today, and if you don’t already have one set, take the first few minutes of your day to write down a list of things to accomplish -- preferably including something you’ve been needing to get done for a while now. Don’t even give yourself the time to question this plan of action, just do it. You’ll be pleasantly surprised by how much you get done when you turn off your brain and roll up your sleeves.","What do you want to achieve with your life? That’s a big question, but one worth asking right now. Are you on the road to your dreams? If the answer is no, then it’s time to figure out why, and figure out what you need to do to get there. Carve out some time to examine your goals closely and, if it only seems like you’re getting further away from them, do what you need to correct course and get back on track.","Take some time to be grateful today, even if only for the little things in life. Chances are you have a lot of blessings, but it’s easy to forget about those in the daily grind. Start out the day acknowledging a few good things in your life, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised just how much it improves your mood for the rest of the day. In fact, this wouldn’t be a bad habit to start implementing every day, so go ahead and start counting.","When was the last time you went and had some pure, honest fun? Not like happy hour with friends, but exciting, unbridled joy, where you didn't worry about what anyone else was thinking of you... Let loose today, preferably with some friends, and give yourself permission to goof off like kids again. You've had enough stressful situations to deal with lately. Today, a carefree attitude and some roaring laughter will do your spirit a world of good.","Your reputation is highlighted today and you could really benefit from looking at yourself from an outsider's perspective. While it’s important not to listen to what people say too often, every once in a while, it’s wise to take the pulse of the situation and make sure that people are seeing you for who you really are. Are people happy with what you provide? Are they impressed with your work? If the answer is no, figure out why and start fixing it.","Although you aren’t a very indulgent sign by nature, it would be in your favor today to simply kick back and daydream about far-off lands. Chances are you haven’t traveled much over the last year or so, but the world is going to open up again to everyone eventually, including you, so start planning where you’d like to visit under sunnier skies. Adventure is calling and you're encouraged to answer the long-distance call; it’ll be a good conversation.","Things could feel a little hot under the collar right now and you'll probably need to find a way to blow off some steam. If you’re feeling frustrated or aggressive, doing an intense workout or even a few fast-paced chores can help to get out some of the excess energy. Follow it up with a quiet night in with a special friend or loved one to reinstill calm and bring your body and mind back to center.","There are going to be a lot of different things clamoring for your attention today, and while you’re generally very good at delegating and getting your work done, it might be more difficult to make progress this time. Be wise and split up your time; hang up the do-not-disturb sign during the day and check off all the necessary boxes, then enjoy someone’s welcome company in the afterhours. Chances are they’ll be more than happy to join you.","It’s a smart idea to get your blood pumping first thing today, not only for the benefit of your body, but because it will help you be far more efficient and productive throughout the rest of the day. Go for a jog after you wake up or, if it’s too cold outside, clear a space aside and do some yoga while some calming incense burns. There are going to be professional mountains appearing in your path, so do some stretches, then start climbing.","Even if there is a lot of work on your plate, you may have little interest in getting it done right now. Normally you’re all about the go-go-go, but take today to choose a different path and focus on nurturing your inner child rather than your inner professional; do some art, watch a fun movie filled with nostalgia, and cook up some comfort food. You can get back to being serious and manifesting major moves tomorrow.","Your home might feel a bit too small or uninspiring today, but this doesn't mean you have to pick up and move. Spend some time browsing interior design pages and furniture websites, perhaps even looking at a few new paint colors. Home has taken on a new meaning lately and being content there matters. With just a few updates, you could feel like you’ve moved into a whole new space that will help you make a fresh start.","Spend some time journaling today and write down whatever comes into your mind. Don’t expect too much in terms of output; just allow yourself to free-write and see what comes out. Don’t do this on a computer, but with just a blank page and a pen. With so many distractions in our daily life, using these simple tools can unlock something wonderful deep within you, giving your mind more space to work. Be it a poem, a story, or just your thoughts, write them down."
2021-01-22,"It’s a great day to get things done while the Moon moves through the last degrees of hard-working Taurus. However, her strong square to messenger Mercury indicates that a bit of unexpected news or information might wing its way to us early on today. We'd be wise to stay patient and not let this throw us off track, though, because the Moon's later trine to transformative Pluto at 4:28 pm EST can help us use that information to our advantage.","Go for gold today and don’t let anyone stop you. With a number of heavenly bodies operating in your money and career sectors, you might have the opportunity to show off in front of some bosses or VIPs. Make sure to put your best foot forward right now, because you don’t want to trip over yourself in the process. The afternoon offers a shot at success, so don't hold back once you have it within your sights!","Look beyond your usual boundaries today and see if you can get inspired by something new. Out of all the signs, you tend to rely on what you know the most, but shaking up the program and diving into a new subject would be a wonderful idea right now. The stars are encouraging you to look far afield for your success, so don’t let a language barrier or spiritual difference stand in the way of expansion and your own success!","Keep your cards close to your chest today because people may be especially inquisitive about what you're up to. While you might normally be more than happy to let them in on your secrets, it would behoove you to hold off on sharing any new information for the time being. There's a reason the stars want you to wait a bit before you unveil anything special, so bide your time for another few days and then get ready to make your mark.","Listening to others' experiences could truly benefit you now. Chances are there are at least a few people in your circle who you admire -- who have accomplished things similar to what you would like to accomplish. Take some time today to ask them about how they managed to achieve everything that they did. They'll likely be more than happy to share some advice, but offering something in return for their help will sweeten the deal.","Your reputation is highlighted today and your professional world is rife with opportunity. It looks as though there will be at least one important pair of eyes focused on you at the moment, so put on your best outfit and show the world all that you can accomplish. You’ve never been one to play the wallflower, and this is definitely not the time to hide away. The more positive attention you can draw toward yourself now, the better.","You won’t be in the mood to deal with obligations for much of the day, but work might still come calling early. Do your best to check off any necessary boxes during the morning hours, then give yourself permission to fly free in the afternoon. The Moon in your adventurous 9th house is activating alchemical Pluto in your 5th House of Creativity, so you’re going to be focused on more interesting things than spreadsheets. Spend the evening reading a new book or watching a travel documentary.","Serious matters like finances could come calling your attention, but you’re going to be much more focused on the fun things in life, so your commitments might need to wait. With Mercury acting up in your 5th House of Passion and Creativity, you have an excuse to chase after your heart’s desire today, then get back to work tomorrow under more productive skies. You are a creature of balance, after all, and will be far more productive after a period of pleasure.","You could get a whole lot of help from others today. While you tend to prefer doing things on your own and not letting too many people in, this is actually the perfect time to open up and see what -- and who -- can enter your life. There’s a good chance someone could offer you a bit of information or an idea without even meaning to, yet this seemingly innocuous info could totally change your view of a matter. It’s a good day for an epiphany.","You can make major strides at work today, so be ready to roll up your sleeves and show everyone else just how competent and capable you are. If you put in the effort now, it looks as though you could get a major reward in return. The Moon is illuminating alchemical Pluto in your money sector, so use his transformative energy to show your superiors just how much you deserve that raise or promotion; they’ll be very impressed.","There’s a tough balancing act going on between doing what brings you joy and doing what you have to do because it’s your responsibility. If you kick off your shoes and spend the day doing something fun, your work will be on your mind and waiting for you. However, if you make a point to get every bit of work done, you’ll be wishing you were having fun with everyone else. Apply some strategic balance and you can get your work done and have fun, too.","It’s going to be easy to zone out today and you may feel like you’re having more trouble than usual clueing in to what's happening around you. There's activity going on in your 12th House of Solitude and Healing, so rather than trying to make today one for the books, make it one for self-care and rest. You can get back to manifesting magic in a few days, but for now, just clock out and take it easy.","Today you could surprise even yourself by your reaction to something or someone, but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Take some time and ask yourself, why is this making me react so strongly? Why does this impact me so much? Chances are something is triggering an idea or feeling you didn’t even know you had. A little self-reflection could help you uncover a fascinating mystery deep within yourself, one that is worth discovering."
2021-01-23,"It’s a big day in the heavens with three major planetary alignments occurring overhead. Expansive Jupiter and action-planet Mars kick things off with a tense square in the early hours, bringing out our aggression, but pleasure-loving Venus' supportive sextile to dreamy Neptune helps to calm the stressful vibrations. The Sun aligns with sober Saturn for their once-a-year conjunction at 10:01 pm EST, making this a very productive day overall; efforts implemented now could result in major rewards down the line.","It’s an opportunistic day to solidify your relationships, specifically your amicable, platonic ones. If you’ve been orbiting on the edges of a social group or club, this is the perfect time to make your membership official. With karmic Saturn aligning with the primal Sun in your friendship sector, you could find a new soul tribe that will last your lifetime. If anyone on your team is doing a less-than-perfect job of playing ball, though, it will become glaringly obvious.","You could make a major mark on the professional front today, so if you’ve been working away at any projects for a while now, this is a terrific time to unveil them. Likewise, if you haven't been putting in the effort, it could become glaringly apparent now, so be prepared to own up to whatever you have or haven’t accomplished. Put your best foot forward today because you have a chance to show what you've got, and all eyes will be watching.","You understand better than most that there is literally no end to the things you can learn. Although you may enjoy soaking in new information just for fun, right now, it might be wise to seek out a class or educational materials that will help you learn a specific, marketable skill. Increase your personal value to increase your net worth; a new degree or certification could make the difference between your current earnings and a whole new tax bracket.","If the only things you do with your money are make it, save it, and spend it, you may be doing your future self a disservice. Right now it would be wise for you to look long-term and consider what you want your lifestyle to look like down the road. Being more active with the money you have now through things like investments and retirement funds can help you live the life you desire. Make your money work for you instead of the other way around.","No person is an island, and while you do well on your own, you understand the value of a shared experience. Make a point to solidify some existing bonds today, be they romantic, platonic, or professional. Anyone who shares a one-on-one relationship with you is worth touching base with, and in the process, you may come to realize just how blessed you truly are. Count the people -- and the blessings -- in your life today.","A new, healthy habit could be just what you need to feel good right now. Especially if the challenges of the past year threw you off your diet or your exercise routine, today, the universe is ready to whip you back into shape. The energetic Sun and strict Saturn are meeting up for their annual conjunction today, and this happens to be in your 6th House of Wellness and Routine. Any new health practices you implement now have rare staying power, so get to it.","Kicking back with a creative project may be your idea of fun, but what if your skills and creations could actually pay the bills? While the vibrant Sun and workhorse Saturn meet up in your 5th House of Art and Expression, it’s a great time to start on something like a manuscript, handicraft, or visual work that could translate to income down the road. Look around your life and take stock of your abilities -- imagine yourself making a living doing something you truly enjoy.","The universe is encouraging you to clear out old energy today and create a clean slate, so spend some time working around the house. Go through old junk drawers, vacuum under the couch, and trash or donate anything that no longer brings joy into your life. By buckling down and getting to some forgotten chores, you'll create space for fresh energy and experiences to enter. Your home is probably more important these days than ever, so make it a place that refreshes you.","Spend some time recording your thoughts today. Crack open a journal or even just a new note on your phone and try to jot down a few paragraphs, if not more, and see where they take you. You might uncover a gem of an idea while you are ruminating on your next sentence, one that could turn into a major project down the line. Tune into your own message right now, because it appears to be very interesting and maybe even profitable.","Give it your all today because you could make some major progress when it comes to your finances and income, and the last thing you want to do is leave money sitting on the table. Thanks to a rare alignment between your ruling planet, Saturn, and the primal Sun in your 2nd House of Money, you could hit a home run at the office, or wherever you go to make your paycheck. Hard work will be rewarded, so roll up your sleeves and get to it.","Be careful not to get too wrapped up in yourself today; you may take things a little too intensely or personally, which will leave you feeling unusually emotional. There’s nothing wrong with leading with your heart, but if you take everything people say at face value right now, it could dampen your spirits when that was never their original intention. Take a step back from people and just focus on you; you’ll be less vulnerable in a few days.","Get lots of rest today and, if you have to wake up early for any reason, make sure to call it an early night. Say no to any invitations, put your phone away, and spend some time curled up on the couch with a good book or easy craft project to keep your hands busy. Your 12th House of Sleep and Solitude is activated today, and the best thing you can do for yourself is lay low; the universe will push you along again in a few days."
2021-01-24,"Dreamy Neptune is spinning along ever so slowly through Pisces, casting a glow over the universe, but that glow might turn into a fog today when the jittery Gemini Moon forms a tense square to the illusory planet at 4:36 pm EST. Things are liable to change under this energy, so it's best not to make plans or sign contracts. Once the Moon forms a quincunx to Venus later in the evening, romance might be on the table -- but getting on the same page as our loved ones won't be easy.","Trying to get your ideas across may be more difficult than usual right now due to a tough angle between the distracted Moon and foggy Neptune. The more you try to push in any one direction, the more difficult it will be for you to vocalize even the simplest thoughts. Give yourself permission to hold off on any important talks because chances are you won't be able to say everything you truly need to say. Patience is key right now.","It's important to keep your eye on the ball today, but that might be more than a little difficult thanks to the fact your friends will probably lob one distraction after another in your direction. Do your best to focus on your responsibilities, and if you can get through even a few of them, then consider that a job well done and clock out. You can achieve more things in a few days, but right now the stars don't expect you to move any mountains.","It can sometimes seem that no matter how hard you chase after your hopes and dreams and aspirations, they are still somehow out of your reach. That won't always be the case, but today those goals on the horizon will seem even further away than normal. Don't get down on yourself just because you can't manifest exactly what you want right now. Keep plugging away at your work and accept that it's OK not to make miracles happen on a day like this.","Life is going to feel like a bit of a dream right now, but it will be the kind of dream where no matter how hard you try, you can't seem to get where you want to go. Instead of fighting against this, your best bet is to float along and take in the scenery as much as you possibly can. You're being given cosmic permission to put reality on the backburner in favor of indulging in your fantasies today, so enjoy every second of it.","You might find yourself trying to walk the fine line between being fun and serious and playful and professional today. Deciding which direction to go in won't be the easiest thing for you to do, as you'll have an increased desire to connect with your best friends rather than facing your more pressing responsibilities. Remember, you can run away from your obligations, but they will still come calling. You'd be wise to hold off on the exciting adventures for another day.","Keep your eye on the prize today. As much as you might want to go after something full tilt right now, there could be a few potholes in the road that you'll need to watch out for. It seems someone in your life -- a partner, a coworker, a friend -- will throw a wrench into your plans and provide more than one distraction when you are attempting to make professional progress. Set boundaries, being patient but firm with this person.","You might be inclined to throw caution to the wind and go off on a wild adventure today. However, reality is going to come back around and remind you there are better ways to handle things than just shrugging your shoulders and assuming things will work out for the best. Whether you like it or not, life is demanding you be on your best behavior right now. Hold off on any escapades until you've crossed every ""T"" and dotted every ""I.""","Pleasure and play are the name of the game for you today, but getting on the same page as someone in your life might be difficult. Whether this is about getting intimate with a partner or just hanging out with a pal, you two won't seem to be on the same wavelength about what you should be doing together. It's okay to stand your ground, but you might have more fun if you let the other person call the shots.","People could push your buttons today, so it might be best to try and make sure you've got plenty of space between you and those who want to offer up unvarnished truths. If anyone knows about shooting straight from the hip, it would be you, but it isn't as much fun when you're on the receiving end of that kind of behavior. Instead of offering yourself up as a target for this kind of honesty, protect yourself and focus on your own needs for the day.","You're going to want to get to the bottom of an important work matter today. It appears that every time you think you are getting closer to unraveling this knotted up string of a problem, you encounter another tangle you hadn't previously noticed. Whether a coworker presents you with a never-ending issue or a client doesn't stop asking for help, something will become more than a little draining. Don't force yourself to fix it all right now; everything happens in due time.","Your focus now might lean more toward wandering off and enjoying yourself rather than taking care of your responsibilities. While that is all well and good, the day's cosmic energies are urging you to sit down and look over your finances with a magnifying glass. There might be a discrepancy in your account or a charge you didn't know about, so take the time to make sure everything is as it should be. The work you do now could fund the fun you have later.","Complicated cosmic energies may make it impossible for you to answer the question ""What do I want?"" today. The influence of these planetary alignments will lead to you being all over the place, so rather than trying to force yourself in any one direction, allow yourself to color outside the lines and see where that creative journey takes you. When you don't put pressure on yourself, the world will naturally offer up good options, leading you to where you were meant to go all along."
2021-01-25,"Our interests are fleeting today, with our passion waning just as quickly as it arose. Attraction-oriented Venus enters freedom-loving Sagittarius at 11:21 am EST, sparking our intensity along with the desire to create distance from our predictable routines. We may pull back without notice, swiftly giving ourselves more personal space to explore the things we love. An easy aspect between Venus and pragmatic Saturn helps us to more clearly define what it is we need now.","Someone in your close-knit circle might come calling for your attention today, and while they might mean their best, there could be something about this situation that leaves you feeling a little uneasy. It could be that you'd rather just stick to yourself for now or are feeling unusually sensitive; whatever it is, it is probably in your best interest for you to do a solo performance right now. You can come back to the people in your life under friendlier skies.","There's a strong possibility you will feel out of sorts today; frustratingly, you won't be able to really tell why. It could be because Chiron, now in your 12th House of the Subconscious, is being activated by the Sun, now in your career sector. Someone at work could call you out in front of your peers or say something that throws you off without even meaning to. Just remember, it's less about the intent of their message and more about how you receive it.","There's an opportunity for conflict today, but don't let that scare you right off the bat. Instead, pay attention to the use of the word ""opportunity."" You and a friend could come to a head over your differences, and while this might create a problem or an argument in the moment, this is the kind of situation you can actually grow from. Don't run from this difficult situation. Not only will everything right itself in the end, you will also learn to view this matter from a different perspective.","Work could be rather intense today, and if it seems like everyone is keeping an extra close eye on you, there is a reason for that. Transformative Chiron is acting up in your career sector today, and this asteroid tends to bring slightly uncomfortable situations your way to help you grow from them. As a result of this cosmic energy, someone high up might breathe down your neck when you'd very much prefer to have your space. There's something to be learned from their pestering, so exercise patience and the lesson will appear.","Someone could emerge from the woodwork today, and their presence may make you feel unsure of yourself. While you generally tend to have a pretty good hold of yourself, you might be feeling a little bit less self-assured than usual. Your self-confidence could take a hit, and this other person will be directly responsible for that. It's one thing to offer constructive criticism, but it's another to swing at you with unnecessary and tactless truths. Keep your space from anyone with a sharp tongue.","Don't be surprised if you're inclined to remove yourself from social situations today. There's nothing wrong with preferring to cocoon away on your own, but the problem is that you might be obliged to deal with things that pop up. A coworker or client could be unnecessarily dramatic about an issue, and whether or not it's your mess to contend with, they'll expect you to clean it up. Pick your battles wisely and draw lines in the sand where everyone can see them.","It's important to express yourself today and show people just how much you can do. What is even more important is to not let anyone get to you just because they decide to respond critically to your preferred forms of self-expression. A romantic partner, close friend, or even someone you work with might decide they have the right to tell you how to behave. No, they don't. Remember, you're your own person and in charge of yourself, so assert your individuality the way you see fit.","Things on the domestic front could cause you a bit of grief today. It's possible the source of aggravation is a family member or roommate, or it could be that your pipes spring a leak, you get locked out, or your electricity goes out. Whatever it is, a home-related matter will likely throw your plans off their normal track. Instead of railing against your circumstances, roll with the punches and accept that, at least for now, your schedule isn't written in stone.","It is important to be truthful with the people in your life, but on a day like this you need to be careful you don't say anything that leaves someone else feeling raw. You might feel as though this person deserves a dressing down, but instead of playing blind justice, why not wait a few days before you deliver any verdicts? The current cosmic energies don't support positive and productive communication, so save yourself the trouble -- and the tears.","People are going to get in the way of your work today, but it won't be a coworker or client who pulls the focus. It's likely that this distraction will happen a little closer to home, like a parent, child, or roommate. Before you react, try to gauge the situation fairly and decide whether or not this person is acting out like this for the wrong or right reasons. Everyone is more sensitive than usual right now, so don't be unnecessarily harsh in your response.","It looks like someone is going to say something or do something that leaves you reeling, so take a step back from people as much as you can today. A sibling or close friend could lob a few barbed arrows in your direction, but it is entirely up to you whether or not you let these arrows hit their target. Your best bet is to step out of the line of fire and avoid any combustible situations until the cosmos calms down.","Even if you have a lot to accomplish and a lot of work in front of you, you don't need to do it all. In fact, you most likely won't be able to easily check off every box on your list today. Instead of forcing yourself to accomplish every single task, try to give yourself a few small chores you can plow through without breaking a sweat. You can roll up your sleeves another day, but you've got permission to take it easy right now."
2021-01-26,"It's a day for surprises and revelations thanks to a strong square between the free-thinking Aquarius Sun and rebellious Uranus in stability-loving Taurus at 7:48 am EST. This alignment will make for a unique and tense combination of unpredictable energies. The Moon forms a helpful angle to Mars shortly thereafter, giving us a chance to take control of the reins. Our best bet is to hold on the best we can, expect the unexpected, and embrace wherever the planets take us today.","While you might have something on the horizon you're eagerly looking forward to, it's possible there will be a fly in the ointment today, something that throws you off the path of running toward the freedom and excitement you crave. An unforeseen obligation or responsibility is likely to pop up, demanding your attention and impeding your time to play. The to-dos of life aren't always enjoyable but they are necessary, so take care of business -- and then go have some fun.","You'd be wise to watch what you say today. In fact, you should not only watch your mouth but just about everything else you do. A number of people will be watching you, and their opinions could carry a lot of weight. It's great to have people notice you, but if you say or do something that doesn't paint you in the best light, you'll end up wishing they'd never stopped to notice you at all. You can get ahead, as long as you stay mindful.","You might not feel like yourself today, as if something's nagging at the back of your mind. Figuring out what's calling to you won't be the easiest thing to do, but this message could be about taking a step away from the hectic pace of life and focusing on your mental health and self-care. You could be getting a little too close to burnout for your own good, so make sure to take time to refill your emotional tank. This will prepare you to make progress once the planets move on to calmer and kinder places.","People will surprise you today, so try to keep an open mind with each and every person you encounter. The more you try and force your agenda, the more likely it is that your plans won't bear any fruit. In fact, you might decide you'd rather keep to yourself, but it looks as though people will come calling your name anyway. Embrace whatever -- or whoever -- comes your way. You might get more than you bargained for, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.","Things could get complicated on the work front today, and the most difficult thing about this is that you won't see these complications coming until it's too late and the problem is staring you straight in the face. Even if you thought you had all your ducks in a row, something is going to cause at least one of them to step out of line. Not all is lost; put one foot in front of the other, and everything will be back in order in no time.","Getting organized may be on your agenda today, but you must accept that as much as you want to check off any outstanding boxes, something could stand in your way. A distraction might present itself when you least expect it, and you might gladly welcome it as it could come in the form of an opportunity for growth. Which areas of your life have you wanted to expand or change? Whether you expected it or not, this may be the direction you're heading in now.","It's going to be a bit of a tightrope walk today as you figure out whether to go all-in with someone or just keep things light and breezy. You might be inclined to show off one minute, and then the urge to hold back could suddenly strike. Instead of putting yourself wholly on display, keep a few cards close to your chest. You can play as much as you like, while not becoming totally vulnerable. This approach gives you the option of sharing more when you're comfortable enough to.","Just because you have plans laid out for your day, someone around you may have different ideas. They could plant themselves firmly in your personal space, demanding your attention and asking for help. Regardless of how close you may or may not be to them, you might feel like you don't have any choice but to lend a hand. It's fine to be a Samaritan but only if you can still take care of yourself. Tend to them now but get back to your needs tomorrow.","It would be lovely to shrug off any and all responsibilities and go have a good time today; unfortunately, any of your happy-go-lucky urges are going to be put on the backburner and your responsibilities will come calling whether you want them to or not. Instead of trying to ignore or hold off on these tasks, face them head-on, roll up your sleeves, and get to work. You can check them off quickly then go do whatever it is your heart desires.","You might be motivated to tackle one professional responsibility after another today, but tense energies could throw your productivity out the window, forcing you to go in a completely different and less useful direction. Is this something to lament? Not all distractions have to be bad. You are industrious almost every day of the year, and when you work that hard, you deserve a break. So, don't worry about what needs to be done. It's more important to go enjoy life now.","It's possible you have a lot of things lined up for the day, or it could be that you want to use this time to focus on you and only you. However, someone or something is going to throw a major wrench into the works. An issue with a family member or your household could surface when you least expect it. Don't get swept up in any histrionics. Try to maintain your classic cool, deal with the issue, then get back to tending to your business.","You may oscillate between fantasy and reality and productivity and laziness now. If you can't seem to figure out what you're supposed to do with yourself, that's OK. Don't expect too much of any one thing or even yourself, and give yourself permission to dabble in a little bit of everything. It's perfectly fine to do a little work and then switch gears by indulging in some daydreaming. This might help you accomplish more than you would have ever expected. Anything is possible on a day like today."
2021-01-27,"The dual powers of love and transformation are at play right now thanks to tender Venus and metamorphic Pluto moving side-by-side. This energy will be thrown slightly off track today when the moody Moon, currently spinning through expressive Cancer, forms tough oppositions to these planets early in the day, first pinging off Venus at 10:37 am EST and then doing the same to Pluto only a couple of hours later. Emotions are liable to run high under this energy, so we need to watch our words and our hearts.","You might feel a bit emotional today, and while you want to focus more on yourself and putter around your house, it looks as though work is going to demand your attention. It is up to you whether or not you actually answer the call and show up to help out. Is it more important to put yourself first right now, or do you need to tend to your obligations today? You do have a choice in the matter, and you get to decide how to react.","You run the risk of being perceived as being inauthentic if what you think and what you communicate to others don't align. If those around you feel as though you're not being your true self and speaking from the heart, it could change the way they view you. Make sure to weigh each and every word before you open your mouth, only saying what you absolutely mean. The last thing you want to do is stick your foot in there.","Be careful about how you spend your money today. You might have more than one tantalizing offer on the table, and while you could be more than happy to hand over your credit card or click ""buy now,"" you may end up regretting it soon enough. If something catches your eye you can certainly add it to your cart, but wait a few days before you actually complete the transaction. That will give you time to decide if you really need it -- or if you just wanted it.","Exercise caution if you offer your unsolicited opinion today, because it looks like someone might not take your well-meaning advice in the heartfelt way it was intended. It's perfectly fine to try and help the people you care about, but if you deliver that help in rather blunt or unkind ways, then it won't be received as such. If there's ever been a time to sugarcoat your tongue, this would be it. You'll attract more flies with honey than with vinegar.","You could feel more sensitive than usual today, so instead of running at life full tilt right now, you're better off taking a step back and giving yourself plenty of space to do whatever will make you feel safe and happy. Things at work could feel especially tense, so if there has ever been a day to clock out early, this would be it. Go home, order your favorite meal, and call it a night. Everything else can wait until tomorrow.","There is a possibility you might not see eye to eye with everyone today. A tough angle between the Moon in your social sector and Pluto in your passions sector means you're going to be much more inclined to follow your heart than listen to anyone else. It's fine to do as you like but try not to run anyone over in the process. You're known for being a considerate sign, so lean on that strength and employ tact in your interactions with others.","You're primed to work your way up the professional ladder today, and for the most part, no one will stop you. However, your attention could turn from work and be firmly planted on what's happening between your own four walls as the day unfolds. Be ready to put out any necessary fires, but don't take on someone else's responsibilities for the sake of going along to get along. You deserve to focus on what matters to you now, no matter how much opposition you face.","What you believe and what others believe could be a sensitive topic today. As much as you generally know where to draw the line in conversation, someone is going to overstep those boundaries and veer into rather personal territory. Whether the person speaking is you or the other person remains to be seen, but you now know the lay of the land, so be careful and watch your words. You don't want to say something you'll regret later.","What it is you desire most is going to be a theme that pops up repeatedly today. So, take some time to think about your passions and wants because the universe may indeed offer you the chance to pursue them -- but at what cost? Is what you want really worth all the effort? If the answer is yes, then go ahead and chase after your dreams. However, if the sacrifice is too great, then perhaps it is time to admit that to yourself.","Brace yourself, because you could encounter a power struggle or two today. Even if you normally prefer to keep things copacetic, it will be rather difficult to keep tempers from flaring over even the simplest of matters. Conversations with your closest loved ones could easily go from civil to chaotic, despite everyone's best efforts. It's best to hold off on any important conversations until the skies calm down and support more constructive communication.","You know what you are supposed to accomplish today, and you're more than ready to get started. However, tough cosmic energies could send your good intentions right out the window, leaving you to scratch your head as you walk in circles. It's normal to feel out of it on a day like this, but the good news is it won't last forever. So, try to get through the day the best you can and only try to tackle what you absolutely must right now.","You can do as you please today, but what you want to do and what someone else wants to do probably won't be the same thing. Unfortunately, this means your fun might have to be delayed if you want to achieve a compromise. It could be that a friend or group of friends wants you to come along and join in their itinerary when you'd rather follow your own playbook. If you're able to add a touch of finesse to this situation, you can manage to do both."
2021-01-28,"It’s a major day in the heavens with one powerful alignment after another. We’re tempted to wear our hearts on our sleeves as loving Venus conjuncts transformative Pluto early in the day, then the Full Moon in Leo will continue to push us to be our most expressive selves; holding back isn’t an option. To top it off, the vibrant Sun aligns with lucky Jupiter for their once-a-year conjunction at 8:40 pm EST, so this day to remember will have an equally memorable night to match.","You’ve got permission from the planets to put yourself front and center today, but that doesn’t mean you have to shine all by yourself. Rather than making this energy all about you, try and turn the general positivity into a group effort, or at least keep some altruistic urges in mind. How can you help yourself AND help others at the same time? It can get a little lonely acting on your own so often, so think about bringing a few people with you.","You can make incredible progress when it comes to your work and professional goals today, so don’t let anyone stand in your way as you roll up your sleeves and pursue your ambitions. Work your absolute hardest during the day, making every hour count, then turn around and reward yourself in the evening for putting in so much effort. You could have a really lovely evening at home with your nearest and dearest, so open your heart to those who matter most.","Your ideas can take you much further than normal right now, so even if you’re the rare kind of Gemini who keeps their mouth shut more often than not, you’ve got cosmic clearance to put yourself on blast and let everyone know what you’re up to. If you have a project or a pitch to make, go on and take your message to the airwaves, because people will be more than a little impressed with whatever it is you have to offer.","There’s never been a better time to start looking for a new source of income, thanks to today’s beautiful Full Moon illuminating your money sector. If your wallet is feeling a little light, then start searching out new leads, because a wonderful opportunity is just waiting for you. If you’re already happy with where you earn your paycheck, it might be time to discuss a raise; put together evidence of just how valuable an employee you are, and VIPs will have trouble saying otherwise.","The focus is on you today thanks to the beautiful Full Moon falling in your sign and shining the cosmic spotlight directly on you. People tend to see you in a better light right now than just about any other time of the year. If there are any dreams or desires you’ve been nursing on the backburner, this is the most opportune time to move them onto high heat, because no one can say no to you under these vibrations.","This is a wonderful day to focus on detoxing your life, but not in the way that requires an extreme diet or ten days at a meditation retreat. Rather, take today to examine your mental state and any negative thinking patterns that might be hindering you from healing. If there are limiting beliefs or extra baggage from old friendships and relationships still hanging around, then it is time to start figuring out what you’re going to do with it; it can’t stay here anymore.","The energy in your living space has become more important than ever, and this is a terrific day to make some intentional improvements. This could be as simple as rearranging a few pieces of furniture, or you may decide to toss out most of your belongings to make a drastic fresh start. Either way, the point is to re-energize yourself by re-energizing your home with more pleasure, beauty, and openness. If something you own doesn’t spark joy, say goodbye.","Go on and celebrate your accomplishments, Scorpio, because the universe is sending you a wonderful present in the form of some sort of career success, and you won’t want to have your head hidden in the sand when it arrives. If there are any projects you’ve been waiting to unveil, this is a terrific time to toot your own horn. Just make sure your boss or another VIP is paying attention, because they will be very impressed.","This could be an incredibly busy day for you, but it looks as though you’ll be more than happy with all the voices clamoring for your attention. The most adventurous and exciting parts of your chart are activated today, so just about anything could come into your life ... provided you are open to it. Say yes to any invitations, and if there aren’t any awaiting your RSVP, then go ahead and send out a few of your own.","You’ve probably heard about the fabled pot of gold waiting at the end of the rainbow. While you’ve also probably learned to discount this as little more than a myth, today, the stars are shining their light upon an unexpected pot of gold, and you don't have to follow a rainbow to find it. Just go on and use your usual methods of rolling up your sleeves and putting in serious effort, and your gold will be easy to reach.","Take a moment to reflect on what you have accomplished recently. Chances are there is something to celebrate -- something you’ve done that you’re quite proud of. Even if you can’t think of anything specific, the universe is giving you permission to kick up your heels right now. The primal Sun and bountiful Jupiter are aligning in your sign for the first time in over a decade, so you have every reason to have fun. You can truly have whatever you like, so make your wishes known.","It’s a great time to get your life in order, so if things have fallen by the wayside, remind yourself of those 2021 resolutions you made and get cracking. Whether it’s a healthier diet, a new meditation practice, or ten minutes of exercise daily, do something that will help you become stronger from the inside out. You don’t need any bells and whistles to make these improvements, just effort and dedication. Your future self will be grateful."
2021-01-29,"There’s an awkward energy in the air as the Moon moves through expressive Leo, encouraging us to show off, yet that urge gets checked by uncomfortable alignments from both Pluto and Venus, which can leave us feeling raw and exposed. Messenger Mercury then opposes the Moon at 8:53 pm EST, so our words and our emotions might not sync up in quite the way we’d like. We should avoid being brutally honest now, because what we say can never truly be taken back.","Even if you have plenty of ideas of what you want to do today, it looks as though someone might show up when you least expect it and throw at least one major distraction in your path. As nice as it would be to please you and only you, sometimes you have to find a compromise, and this is one of those times. Try to lead with tact now and you’ll be glad you did when the result is much better than anything you’d manage alone.","Discussions at work can go in your favor right now, but even if things seem to be happening for the better, you might find yourself feeling a little emotional without quite knowing why. Perhaps a family matter on the backburner is starting to heat up, or maybe you are just a little taken aback by everything going on in your life; it’s okay to count to ten and take some deep breaths before answering any questions today. Focus on balance.","There’s quite a bit of fun to be had today, as long as you don’t try to control where it takes you. You might start out the morning with a pretty sure idea of what you want to accomplish, but don’t be shocked if a distraction comes your way and takes you on a wonderful adventure. It doesn’t have to be a literal adventure, it can be mental, spiritual, or even emotional, but new vistas are coming your way, so get ready.","You might find yourself feeling a little insecure about your money right now, but that's only temporary, as long as you make a point to do something about it. Sit down with all your financial statements and try to figure out a way to streamline them and make your money work harder for you. If you can afford to hire a financial planner, this is the perfect time. Although it will take effort, the comfortable life you desire is possible.","Someone could leave you feeling a little exposed today, so be careful about just how much you are willing to share with another person. While it’s good to trust people, it’s important to know who you can actually trust -- if you are too easygoing about this, it might come back to bite you under today’s conflicting energy. Keep your confidantes close but keep everyone else at arm’s length. People will be more trustworthy in a few days if you still want to share your secrets.","Don’t expect too much of anyone today, and that includes yourself. Even if you are hoping to plow through some tasks and lighten your load, it looks as though you’ll wind up getting distracted with one thing or another -- perhaps even just a co-worker or client who won’t stop gossiping when you’re trying to cross off tasks. You don’t have to copy their behavior, but it wouldn’t hurt to give yourself permission to loosen up a little bit either.","It’s a great day to link up with some friends for a good time, but it doesn’t need to be your best friends ever. Perhaps there is someone in your group you only know a little bit, or maybe there’s a friend of a friend who's worth spending more time with. Either way, step outside your comfort zone today and try building a new relationship rather than returning to the tried-and-true; you’ll be pleased with the results.","You’ve got a busy day ahead of you, but no matter how much you try to focus on professional matters, it looks like a storm that's brewing on the home front will be clamoring for your attention. Thanks to a tough angle between the demonstrative Moon and Mercury, currently in your home and family sector, a roommate or relative could cause drama at the worst possible moment. Prepare to put out any fires as soon as they start smoking.","You have lots of things to accomplish and lots of impressive ideas, but just how realistic are they? You can come up with new projects at the drop of a hat, but today, you need to sit down and make sure all these possibilities have the legs necessary to move into realistic territory. If there’s something missing from your plans, it’s better to figure it out now, rather than down the road at an important moment.","Something may catch your eye today and it’s important to ask yourself if you really need this item, or you just want it. You’re especially prone to filling certain voids with material goods right now, yet while a little retail therapy doesn’t hurt every once in a while, some actual therapy might be worth investing in, too. Go on and make some healthy purchases that will benefit your contentment and well-being in the long run.","You know what you need to be happy, but you may have left others in the dark. If you’ve been playing nice with people for fear of making waves, then it's time for a change because the universe wants you to get real. If anyone has been taking more than their fair share of your time lately, it’s important that you let them know and tell them what you will and won’t tolerate; people will be willing to listen, so be honest.","Spend some time journaling today and, if you remember your dreams, then definitely write them down, because there might be a special message hidden somewhere amongst those fantastical visions. If you can’t recall anything, just do a little free writing or poetry and don't try to control where it goes. You could come up with some truly visionary epics on a day like this, so answer the call of the muse and see what inspiration she shares with you."
2021-01-30,"Mercury turns retrograde this morning for the first time in 2021, hitting the snooze button at 10:52 am EST. This time the cosmic communicator will be sleeping in Aquarius, the sign of technology, change, and humanity, so we should avoid investing in any new gadgets and not create unnecessary friction between ourselves and our friends, since people are more likely to rub one another the wrong way now. Still, the sensitive Moon's trine to rebellious Uranus in the afternoon reminds us to expect the unexpected.","It’s time to reconsider your friend groups and how you fit in with them as Mercury turns retrograde in your social sector. You might not see eye-to-eye with people during this 3-week period, and the people you normally go to complain about such things might not be very sympathetic, either. Instead of trying to prove yourself right, keep an open ear and an open heart and be prepared to eat some humble pie if you normally let hubris take the reins.","Don’t aim too high right now, because the universe is going to be providing a few pitfalls when you’d rather see clear steps up a ladder. Messenger Mercury begins its retrograde in your career sector today, turning your workload into a heavier burden than usual. Try not to show off too much, because VIPs will be watching and the last thing you want to do is make a major mistake while under a microscopic lens. Check and double-check your work and just stay focused on the task at hand.","It’s time to reconsider all the things you think you know as your ruling planet, Mercury, turns retrograde in your 9th House of Expansion today. Normally this time of year would be all about growing your mind as much as you can, but this time, there are going to be more detours and complications than you might know what to do with. Instead of trying to push ahead into unknown territory, focus on the tried-and-true for now and know that the time to advance will come soon.","Issues of sharing and confidence might come up over the next few weeks as Mercury moves backward in your intimacy sector, throwing a wrench in some of your most important relationships. This isn’t exclusively about romance -- it's any relationship in which you share things with someone else, even things like your credit card with the company that provides the credit. Avoid signing any contracts for the time being and know that if something seems too good to be true, then it probably is.","You and someone else won’t be on the same page for the next few weeks, so if you think you and a business or romantic partner are moving ahead at a positive pace, you may be in for a surprise. While Mercury retrogrades through your 7th House of Partnership, don’t sign any contracts or make any verbal agreements, because there are too many potential mistakes waiting to trip you up. Be especially clear and careful with your words during this time to avoid major miscommunications.","Things might get a little complicated at work over the next few weeks thanks to Mercury turning retrograde in your 6th House of Work and Wellness today. Your attention turns to problems and miscommunications rather than the progress you were planning to make. Since this retrograde also impacts your health, though, don’t push yourself too hard mentally or physically or else you might find yourself burning out before you've accomplished even a fraction of what you wanted to.","Your mind has been flooded with colorful notions and creative urges as of late, but today, Mercury puts a kink in the line as he turns retrograde in your 5th House of Expression. New ventures are exciting, but they aren't supported now -- instead, this is the best time to return to something you were working on in the past. Whether it's an art project you began or even a person who once brought you joy, revisiting it may be very rewarding.","Things might feel a little closed-in over the next few weeks thanks to Mercury turning retrograde in your 4th House of Home and Family today. Try to maintain a semblance of tact as best you can, but don’t be shocked if you can barely contain your upset when a roommate or family member steps over the line. Finding space for yourself will be more difficult than usual for the time being, so breathe deep and be patient.","You'll need to watch your words as messenger Mercury turns retrograde in your communications sector today, causing potential misunderstandings with others over the next three weeks. Whenever Mercury visits this part of your chart, it makes for a very busy time, but since he’s going to be asleep at the wheel this time, it will be especially easy to get your wires crossed as you try to keep all your appointments and plans straight. Take notes and stay sharp!","It could be more than a little difficult to get a clear picture of your financial standing over the next few weeks, with Mercury turning retrograde in your money sector today. You'd be wise to keep your wallet shut, so if something bright and shiny catches your eye, do your best to hold off until Mercury turns direct. Try not to show off too much on the work front, either, because it won't likely be received well by others.","Mercury has you in his sights as he turns retrograde in your sign and your 1st House of Identity today. Normally Mercury's transit through your sign is a time to take hold of the cosmic megaphone and let everyone know what you’ve got going on, but for the next three weeks, it would be best if you kept your cards close to your chest and refrained from telling anyone what you’re up to. Keep working your own magic and prepare to step into the spotlight once Mercury turns direct.","It feels as though something is tickling your brain as messenger Mercury turns retrograde in your 12th House of Subconsciousness today. Your sleep schedule could get thrown out the window over the next three weeks as your mind tries to process this erratic energy. It seems like you can’t tune out the static buzz, but there is a good reason for it -- try to listen in a new way and you may discover something very interesting between the lines."
2021-01-31,"Things might seem a bit confusing today, so the general rule of thumb is to not force anything -- the more we try to force something, the more complicated and confounding it will become. The Moon is in efficient Virgo, which normally makes for a wonderfully productive period, but a tough opposition from foggy Neptune at 12:09 pm EST will leave us all scratching our heads. Thankfully, things become clearer when the Moon trines powerful Pluto, reminding us of what we can accomplish.","While you might be planning to make this an efficient and productive day, don’t be shocked if these plans get waylaid by a wave of fantasy and passivity that seems to strike out of nowhere. Instead of forcing yourself to be on top of your game, give yourself permission to ease up and follow your daydreams, wherever they might take you. This is the kind of day to go somewhere over the rainbow instead of somewhere like the gym or office.","There’s a delicate balance between doing what you want and doing what everyone else wants. Today, the universe is encouraging you to go after your own heart’s desire, but at the same time, it looks as though one friend or a whole group of them will come clamoring for your attention whether you want it or not. Although you could put up some boundaries, you could also satisfy both yourself and others with a bit of flexibility.","Spending the day puttering around the house and spending time with loved ones feels like just what you need to find replenishment now ... unfortunately, an interruption from work or some other responsibility might make that more difficult than you’d hoped. It's possible a VIP or boss will call on you to perform at the last minute, so be alert and ready to jump in, because you could come out on top when you least expect it.","You are probably going to find yourself tongue-tied today, so if you were planning to make any big reveals or get on a soap box, it would be best if you hold off for the time being. The Moon is moving through your communication sector, which normally makes for a wonderful time to express yourself, but a difficult angle from foggy Neptune is muddling your ideas before they even leave your mouth. Be patient and share your thoughts under clearer skies.","You'd be smart to watch your spending today; if something attractive catches your eye, mull over the purchase for a day or two before you make a final decision. Thanks to some confusing energy happening in your financial sector right now, you could bite off more than you can chew when it comes to your cash flow. Even if it seems doable, it’s not worth getting yourself into a jam, so hold off until you won’t be in the red.","Getting on the same page as anyone else will be rather difficult today. Even if you think you are being crystal clear, whoever you’re dealing with won’t likely be reflecting anything back to you with clarity. The Moon in your sign is receiving a tough beam from confusing Neptune in your partnership sector, so people are liable to shirk their responsibilities and leave you hanging. Count on you and only you until the universe gets more supportive.","Taking it easy today will help you begin the week with the energy you need. Make it a point to slow down and treat your body with kindness; do some yoga, cook some nourishing food, and curl up on the couch with a good book or movie. You are a creature of balance and it's important that you instill that balance now. You'll pick up speed in a couple days when the planets start pushing you along.","Although you may have plans to meet up with friends or pursue some other sort of social engagement today, it's likely you'll end up choosing a different path and chasing after your own desires. There’s nothing wrong with taking some time away from people; in fact, it could do you a world of good. Don't just drop out, though -- give others the courtesy of saying you’ll be back in a couple days, ready to pick up where you left off.","You can make a lot of progress with your work today, despite a change of plans. At first it may seem like there is an open road ahead of you, but don’t be shocked if you need to take a detour to avoid an unexpected obstacle. Someone could come out of the woodwork to push your buttons or to trip you up because they're jealous of your success. Watch out for yourself and don’t let anyone impede your ascent to the top.","Your spirit is yearning for adventure and though you may not be able to travel far, spending the day reading travel blogs or planning your next vacation could satisfy your wanderlust. At the same time, it looks like something closer to home will pop up and demand your attention. A friend or sibling could come to you with a problem that looks small, but remember that just because it’s small to you doesn’t mean it’s small to them. Give your loved one the attention they deserve.","Don’t make any bets on yourself today; not because you aren’t very capable, but because the universe is stacking the deck against you and your ability to accurately size up a situation. Even if something looks clear and manageable to you, there is a good chance it will turn out to be anything but. No matter how lucky you're feeling, the wisest thing you can do right now is hold back and play it safe. Your time will come.","Deciding what you want might be rather difficult today. Other people will probably have plenty of ideas to offer, but while some may interest you, they could also leave you feeling a little underwhelmed. You have a better chance of enjoying yourself if you just go with the flow and keep your expectations low. That way, if there are any surprises or setbacks that occur, they cannot throw you off course because they simply are the course."
2021-02-01,"We need to take a look at the way we use the power we have, even if we don’t think of ourselves as powerful. The willful Sun's aggravating square to fiery Mars early in the morning may cause frustration with our community, but instead of reacting in anger, we should use our influence to bring peace. Once the Moon enters Libra soon after, balance is easier to find. Thankfully, when Venus moves into friendly Aquarius at 9:05 am EST, we'll see ourselves opening up and becoming more accepting of others.","Plant your feet on solid ground today and don’t let uncertainty waver you. You will need to set your boundaries for the day without hesitation and, after you draw that line, make certain that you don’t let others cross it. Trust yourself to know what’s best for you and understand that the way you feel is valid. If someone is crossing a line of yours after you’ve made it clear, then it may be time to re-evaluate that person’s power in your life.","You may find yourself in a case of mistaken identity today, where others try to describe your personality for you, despite your statements to the contrary. Don’t let anyone else tell you who you are. Instead, gently correct them and remind yourself of this: those who will argue with you about your character will likely tell others about their personal version of you, causing them to get the wrong idea. Share who you are with confidence and eliminate the confusion!","It's quite likely you woke up today feeling an internal change ... one that you can’t quite put your finger on. This could be a feeling about someone in your life or a goal that you’ve been working toward. Whatever the case, you felt strongly one way yesterday, but today, you may not be so sure. One of your greatest assets is the power to change your mind and evolve into a new version of yourself without needing to cling to the old you. It’s time for an upgrade!","You don't give your trust to just anyone, but you might be placing a lot of trust right now in someone you depend on. Sometimes we have to depend on others, but make sure that you haven’t given all your power over in favor of comfort and stability. It’s tempting to hand someone else the keys when they say they’ll get you where you need to go, but it's important that you still have agency in your life. Do something for yourself today!","An important relationship in your life may be clashing with your career or your public identity, and you have to decide how to balance these key aspects of your life. If you’ve been working hard but not giving much emotional energy to your loved ones, surprise them with something special to let them know you care. Alternatively, if you’ve been giving friends and family 110% while your career goals lag behind, devote some energy to pushing forward in your career. Balance is everything.","If you’ve been burning the candle at both ends, it may be time to set down your responsibilities and rest for a moment. You have been working hard on something, putting in the hours every day, but you are spreading yourself thin this way. If you wear yourself down too much, you won’t be able to accomplish all the other wonderful changes that you’re trying to make for yourself. Take a breather and try to pare down the errands and goals so you can focus your efforts.","Gauging the emotional temperature in a social situation is something you’re naturally adept at, and you'll need to use those skills today to keep the peace. There is a chance that someone will throw you off by using humor when they should have been serious or using criticism when they should have been lighthearted. Although you’re feeling more emotional than normal now, don’t take anything personally -- just let any social missteps by others roll off your back. Grace is your middle name.","You might find yourself torn between new people and established people in your life today. Do you go with the people who have known you for longer, or the ones who are more accustomed to the current version of you? Instead of trying to decide who you want to please more, take a quiet moment and realize that both groups have supported and loved you, and either will understand your choice. Choose what will make you happiest right now.","Conversation may not come as easily as usual to you, and the people in your life might be confused as to why you’re acting differently. While a little brain static should be expected today, pay attention to how the people in your life react to your mistakes. If they’re unwilling to give you the grace that you need to grow and learn, and they’re unwilling to be honest with you about that, it may be time to create space between the two of you.","You may be in the mood for some retail therapy today, but make sure you’re not breaking the bank to pay for impulse purchases. If a must-have item catches your eye, ask yourself: will this really make me happy in the long run? Try waiting ten minutes while you think about the long-term purchases that you’ve been saving up for, then see if it's still worth it. When it comes to saving, patience and perseverance will pay off in spades!","Sometimes it's necessary to put yourself first, because you can’t pour from an empty cup. However, make sure that by focusing on you, you’re not leaving the people who care about you in the dust. While you don’t have to let anyone in your life that you don’t want there, you also don't want your standards for others to be so high that your life is a blank book. It’s difficult to write a story with only one character, so reach out!","Your spiritual life and your subconscious mind are highlighted now, so use your powerful intuition to move through any uncertain or confusing situations, and don’t be afraid to ask for a shoulder to lean on if you need it. As you may feel more tired or absent-minded than normal, make a note to drink enough water and get enough sleep so that you’re prepared. Pay attention to your dreams and their symbolism as well, as your subconscious might have an important message for you."
2021-02-02,"We can expect harmony between the head and heart under the calming influence of the Moon in loving Libra trine the Sun in cerebral Aquarius at 5:50 am EST. Every area of our lives feels a little easier now; hesitation melts away and confidence blends with emotional sensitivity to help us put our best foot forward. Our actions feel effortless as we are blessed with a sense of inner peace, and for those who are looking to make amends, it will be easier than ever.","Adoration is in the cards for you today and you’re ready to bask in the love. People are acting more cooperative -- friends of yours who don't normally get along are more willing to play ball, and any groups that you’re leading will progress smoothly. You may even be feeling a little lucky, so do something you would do if you could do anything! There’s no benefit to boxing yourself in and doubting your abilities; let others know what you’re made of!","Your responsibilities and career are highlighted and you know that you’re up to the task! You can expect your job to be a little easier than normal; a coworker or client might even have you laughing and in good spirits before the workday is over. You may very well be recognized for your hard work and dedication as well, and you will be able to accept these compliments with grace. Playing small and refusing to accept praise won’t feel right, no matter how humble you are, because you deserve it!","New horizons have never felt so close as creativity and fun merge with learning and travel. You’re better able to turn your thoughts into words today, and eager to share broad-reaching philosophies and discuss deep ideas with others. You have an extra flair for charm and humor, yet you can have respectful and enlightening debates. Share your thoughts and be open to learning from the people around you -- expanding your mind will be an enjoyable experience.","You’re at the beginning of a peaceful transformation and your internal guide can help you see through the haze of indecision. You know that you’ve wanted to make a change in your scenery for some time, but it may have never felt like the right time. Try starting close to home. Simply adding some fresh decor or creating more fun experiences with your family or roommates will help to transform your everyday life into something more enjoyable and enriching.","Love and forgiveness are in the air, and you want to tell everybody! You are feeling more confident in your relationships with others and you can communicate yourself with care and honesty. You may receive a thoughtful message from someone special today, or you may let go of bad blood toward an ex or a former friend. You’re becoming lighter and more sincere, because you’ve realized that grudges only hurt those who hold them, and pretending you're someone else doesn’t bring the right people into your life. Let go!","Finances are looking up today and making money may come much more easily to you. You can also ask for a favor and expect to get a positive result. The old adage “if you want a job done right, you have to do it yourself” doesn’t apply right now, because you can get things done quicker with someone by your side. Although your way is often the right way, you’re more secure in delegating tasks today and can let go of the reins without fear of losing your progress.","If you have to work today, try to keep it light and don’t let the negative attitudes of others bring you down. You don’t always have an opportunity for fun like you do now, so once your responsibilities are taken care of, find an old hobby or activity that brought you lots of joy in the past and dust it off. Your sense of humor is also heightened today, so if you can, bring a little of that joy to someone else who may need it!","Comfort and security are highlighted for you today and, with a little solitude and some cozy surroundings, you can watch your current worries melt away. Turn off social media notifications, block out any negative presences, and spend some time with your personal thoughts. Once you’re in your private sanctuary, accept no interruption. You understand yourself better than anyone, and you know how a little rest in your own company gets you back on track. Remember who you are and don't compromise your needs.","You may be on the receiving end of some extra attention today, but people will notice your positive traits instead of your flaws, giving you a confidence boost that can propel you to success. Sometimes it’s hard to want to see yourself from the perspective of others, especially if you’ve experienced some unnecessarily critical people in the past. Compliments can be hard to accept if you aren’t used to them, but instead of deflecting with jokes, smile and accept others' sincerity!","Both your career and finances are looking secure right now, without you even having to put in much effort. You're a hard worker, but today, take advantage of easy material gains and breeze through your tasks with no delays -- don't make anything harder for yourself. Now is a good time to make investments or to market yourself as a valuable employee or business partner, though, as others are ready to put their trust in you. The more you believe in yourself, the more others will believe in you.","Your mind can take you very far right now as research and schooling will come naturally to you, and any subject that you set your mind to learning should be easy. If you struggled to learn anything in the past, try picking it up again today and see if you start absorbing the information better. If expanding your mind doesn’t float your boat, you could update your look with something a little more daring. Build yourself up with whatever brings you joy!","It's an introspective day for Water signs like you! You can expect to come to some spiritual revelations and eureka moments with little effort required. Spend some time in meditation and watch solutions come flooding in. If you feel tears begin to flow or laughter build inside you, let it out. You will feel so much lighter once the trapped emotions are acknowledged and set free. Be honest with yourself about how you feel and give yourself space to feel it without shame."
2021-02-03,"Don’t push for control now, because it’s likely to have the opposite effect. The sensitive Moon's early square to intense Pluto can make us feel off-balance or chaotic. When the Moon moves into fierce Scorpio at 9:15 am EST, our need for control is higher, but our ability to gain it is a bit out of reach. We may feel especially dissatisfied or frustrated with our relationships or our work while the Moon squares loving Venus and taskmaster Saturn. Patience and grace are key in navigating this tenuous energy.","Your road to success is paved with an ability to stand up for yourself, but it's vital you don't lash out at everyone in your path. You may be tempted to emotionally bulldoze over those who would oppose you today, but there’s no way to run over others without hurting yourself, too. If someone rudely cuts you off in traffic or annoyingly forgets your meeting, let it go! Ultimately, what’s the harm in moving on quickly? The irritation that you cling to will only burn you, not them.","There may be a person in your midst who isn’t interested in seeing you succeed, and today they might make an attempt to put you in what they think is ""your place."" You're confused as to why they’re going after you, and the answer is likely jealousy or misplaced anger caused by another issue in their life. The better you are at letting the attitudes thrown your way just roll off your back, the easier it will be to maintain a happy mood.","You might be feeling a little under the weather today or overwhelmed with responsibilities, so give yourself some time to breathe. While it feels urgent to complete every single one of the tasks before you, it’s ultimately not worth risking your health and peace to check everything off your list. If it makes you miserable, let it wait. If you choose to prioritize just a few subjects, your health and financial subjects like taxes, loans, and investments require the most attention now. Protect your peace!","You just want to enjoy the day, but stress keeps getting in the way! It may seem like the people you trust and depend on most aren’t available right now, making you feel abandoned in your hour of need. Realize that this day might be a struggle for many, though, and the other person may be having “one of those days” just like you are. If, however, they’re quite cold in letting you know this, you may want to re-evaluate where you put your trust.","Family matters are highlighted for you now, and you could overextend yourself if you’re unrealistic about the time and energy you have to provide. This delicate decision-making process is up to you, but remember that while you may have the best intentions to be generous and serving, there is only so much you can do within 24 hours. There is no need for you to make empty or impossible promises just to please others short-term. You can only be in one place at one time!","It may feel like you’re out of sync with the people in your life, so you will need to be flexible in order to conquer the day. Missed calls and important emails ending up in the spam folder are common under today's energy, and your mode of transportation might be less than cooperative despite your best efforts. This is a lesson in patience and rolling with the punches, so be prepared to rewrite your plans a few times and don’t sweat the small stuff!","A loved one might say the wrong thing at the wrong time, and though you have a right to be offended, try and treat the situation with grace anyway. Poise and diplomacy are two of your best qualities and they will be tested in ways you weren’t expecting today. Your emotional security is at stake as your reaction to needling comments determines how the rest of the day goes. Reply to any backhanded compliments and passive aggression by casually asking people to explain their remarks. Keep your cool.","It may be difficult to find the right words to say, and you may end up setting off people in your life without meaning to. Think carefully before you speak, and if you’re not sure about how a touchy topic might be received, file that risky comment away for a later date when the planets are more favorable. You can also be more sensitive yourself, so try not to jump to conclusions if you feel affronted. Remember, silence can be golden!","Confusion and forgetfulness can be your biggest saboteurs today, and if you’re not careful, you could end up late for a very important date. Pay special attention to times and addresses so that you don’t wind up wasting time with mishaps. If things end up a little sideways despite your best efforts, give yourself a pat on the back for trying. There’s no use in letting a detour get you down, because in the end, you’ll get to where you’re trying to go.","You may have a difficult time compromising with friends and acquaintances despite your efforts; you can’t control the actions of others, even with the best intentions. People’s rebellious natures are activated today, so any attempts at controlling them will be met with strong resistance. Even if you see your friends jumping off a bridge, all you can do is tell them of the danger that exists. Don’t grab on to them, or else they'll take you down with them.","There could be some unsavory rumors swirling around you, but with your progressive ideals and forward-thinking prowess, you’re no stranger to being misunderstood. You don’t have to be understood in order to move forward with your plans, but it certainly makes it easier, and others will not make it easy for you today. Continue to be the authentic individual you are and stand tall in your beliefs, but don’t try to convince the stubborn opposition that you’re right. You often feel changes coming before others, so trust in that!","You may feel like a racehorse today that's raring to go, but stuck in the gate. As frustrating as it is to have to go back and revise mistakes that are preventing you from moving forward, giving up won't help you move forward either. Climb out of the box you’re in mentally and, if you find that you need to redo paperwork or projects that you thought you were done with, tackle it now rather than later. The sooner you start chipping away at it, the better!"
2021-02-04,"Important decisions help us learn about ourselves when we are forced to choose between two options we really want. The introspective Moon's square to philosophical Jupiter might require us to decide between our long-held morals and our inner voice. However, Luna's opposition to spontaneous Mars at 9:51 am EST can make us reckless with our choices, so we must resist the urge to jump in without thinking. Thankfully, the Moon's later trine to spiritual Neptune helps us listen to our intuitions and guides us on the right path.","You have your way of operating in your own life and you’re not interested in the opinions of others when it comes to how you conduct yourself. Today, though, it might be better to hear them out. You may resist depending on others to give you guidance after people misled you in the past, but even when you’re certain you’re doing the right thing, sometimes it’s difficult to see what a situation looks like from the inside. Make your own decisions, but have the maturity to consider another's perspective.","Your heart might be outside of your body right now in the sense that you're caring more for others than for yourself. Just make sure that you’re not shining the spotlight on everyone around you in order to prevent yourself from failing publicly. Fear of success is the biggest roadblock for you right now, but it’s not fair to you to remain in the dark. Even slow progress is progress; the only way you can really fail right now is if you give up.","You might go looking for information where you know you’ll find it, despite the negative effect that it could have on you. Snooping or fishing for information will not work out in your favor, even though you may be unsure how to proceed without this data. Although you could be uncertain of another person’s intentions and you want confirmation, you can change how they feel by trying to find things out without their knowledge. Be honest and upfront with them about your concerns.","It will be tempting to procrastinate or slack off, but it's not worth shirking your responsibilities for a little downtime. A lack of discipline right now could hurt your forward momentum, and putting off what you could do today will only end up hurting you tomorrow. Procrastination is not your friend, so bite the bullet and tackle your tasks with the knowledge that fun will be even more fun without the nagging feeling of incomplete projects. Work now, play later!","You may be feeling a bit of imposter syndrome right now and you’re not sure if you should go for an opportunity that is before you. While considering your skills and talents, be honest with yourself about where you are in your career journey and don’t inflate or deflate your worth according to your personal emotions. Take as rational a look as possible at what you’re capable of; making a list of your strengths and weaknesses might help you to make a decision. Know yourself!","You may feel torn between a desire to express your true feelings -- even though it could be risky -- and a desire to keep everything the way it is. If you’re motivated by impulsivity, then take a look at what may have triggered this urge to make your feelings known. While it can be cathartic to say what’s on your mind, some things are better left unsaid. Ultimately, go with what your heart tells you and own the consequences, whatever they may be. To thine own self be true!","You can be presented with striking opportunities to save for your future today ... and also opportunities to spend frivolously. Your head says go with the practical option, but your heart says that you only live once and you should embrace that. It’s up to you whether you decide to spend some cash or save it for a rainy day, but put yourself in the shoes of the future you before you go shopping. If you felt a tinge of regret, then hold off for now.","It seems like everyone has an opinion on what you should be doing with your life, and you may not even be sure what your own opinion is after all the feedback. Be cautious of following the dreams of others, especially if it’s something that you had not wanted to do originally. Sometimes we think we want something for ourselves when, in reality, we want to please the people we love. Remember: It’s your life, and you’ll have to live with the decision you make!","Your feelings are the focus right now and you may be conflicted about telling someone you’re no longer interested in pursuing a friendship or relationship. This could even be a desire to quit your job, but you are hesitant to put your workplace in a difficult position. While it can feel noble to suffer through situations that you don’t enjoy for the sake of others, eventually, your nobility turns to resentment. Be honest with yourself about what you really want and act on it!","You want to do what’s best for others, but there are situations in which you simply can’t please everyone. Any attempt to spread yourself thin to make everyone in your life happy will only end up making you miserable -- especially if they each need you to be a different person in their company. It’s exhausting trying to keep up with who everyone else expects you to be. If you’ve painted yourself into an emotional corner, it's time to come clean with your true feelings.","You may come across as absent or disinterested to others now, even if you’re not really. Try not to avoid sincere conversations because people are likely to misunderstand your intentions. You know your heart is in the right place, but make sure that you’re appearing the way that you want to. If it takes extra time and more words to explain where you’re coming from, make the space to do so. Communicate your thoughts in full so that others don't fill in the blanks.","If you are trying to move on from an emotional situation, make sure that you aren’t trying to do it too quickly. Your feelings are there whether you choose to acknowledge them or not, and the way you deal with them now will determine how they show up in your life later. If you try to shove your emotions away until you want to acknowledge them, they can erupt at a difficult time when you least expect it. If you want to move on, do it the right way."
2021-02-05,"It's time to clear out the cobwebs! We might not have the words to express our feelings when the introspective Moon squares mental Mercury, but when Luna sextiles transformative Pluto a few hours later, we'll receive powerful changes to our inner lives that don't need words, only actions. Once the Moon enters Sagittarius at 12:16 pm EST, the clear path will reveal itself, no longer caught in indecision. Leave behind what has been keeping you stagnant, even if you have to cut the cord without closure.","Today could be a lesson in learning from your past. You may feel like you've fallen into a familiar cycle lately, especially with the people you tend to give chance after chance to. You want to tell them how you feel, but you are struggling to say what you need to say while preserving the relationship. Honesty is the best policy, but if you can't be honest with kindness, it's likely to go sideways. If you can be honest and kind but they still don't respect your feelings, it's best to move on.","Trust is key, and it's best if you can be realistic about who you can rely on. There are people in your life who insist they can provide you with help you may not have even asked for. While it is given with the best of intentions, you have seen how it can end up being more of a hindrance than anything else. Remember, the people you can trust with something small you can trust with something. Use discretion when accepting a helping hand.","You could be starting to feel like a stranger in your own life after getting caught up in someone else's drama or lifestyle. As a Mutable sign, you can easily pick up the habits and attitudes of the people you choose to surround yourself with. Give yourself space and spend a little time alone to see if you've been acting out of character. If you have, schedule some more time to connect with yourself. Be the person you know you are.","You may have been stuck in a rut lately, and you haven't been keeping up with your daily routine as well as you have wanted to. Take a quiet moment to be with yourself and get back into the swing of things, because it only gets more difficult the longer you put it off. It might also be time for a little winter cleaning if you're clinging to items that hold sentimental energy for you. Your mood reflects your space, so clear out the clutter.","It's time to let your creative light shine! You might have been hesitant to fully express yourself, perhaps being afraid of falling on your face. However, you were born to take center stage and now it's time to plan your next big debut. Don't give too much power to others and their opinions -- you can end up being led down the wrong path if you don't follow your instincts. Lead in your own unique way and you can't go wrong.","It's possible you're feeling more sensitive than usual when it comes to your home and family life. If anyone tries to make you feel small regarding this part of your life, don't take their ignorance too seriously. These words could weigh more heavily if you're being bogged down by the drudgery and routine of day-to-day life. Try to keep things fun and light and you'll be able to stay positive. Your heart and your home are meant to be protected.","What others think of you and getting their approval isn't everything. Movies that are highly informed by the public's opinion often feel watered down and pandering, and people are the same way. If you live your life trying to please everyone, then you'll only end up a version of your true, vibrant self. Not everyone will agree with your pure essence, but that is what you're here to be. Make a pact to tune out the noise and live authentically.","You may realize you're playing it too safely in the game of life today. If you're taking risks and giving yourself the space to grow into your transformative nature, then you are on the right path. If you're not being true to your Scorpion nature, refusing to shed your old skin in order to feel secure, you're going to end up feeling suffocated in your too-small shell. It can be scary to venture out into the unknown, but you can't find rewards by staying where you are.","You're highly magnetic right now and the best part is, you don't even need to try. However, don't get too caught up in the social whirlwind that could happen as a result of your increased charm. It's better to show off through your actions than your words, because you're likely to let your thoughts and feelings get jumbled, which could cause you to blurt out things you wouldn't normally say. Choose your words carefully and stick to what you know.","Hidden emotions could come to the surface today. If you've been keeping something under wraps, it might be time to reveal it to the world. It won't necessarily feel like the safest and most secure thing to do, but it's required for you to fully evolve into the person you're meant to be. If there's a confession or fear you've been wanting to get off of your chest, it's time to stop letting it weigh you down. You'll feel so much lighter and free once it's in the open.","Identifying the strongest links in your support system will be key today. These are the people you need to be focusing on in your life, as power dynamics have shifted, causing you to get a different vibe from someone in your inner circle. It may be time to clear the air, because anything you ignore now could come back to haunt you. If you've noticed a cold shoulder in your midst, ask about it with kindness. However, if someone offers an ultimatum, don't feel like you have to accept it.","Your inner goals can't be contained any longer. You could have the dream of creating fame and fortune active in your mind -- just be sure you don't overdo it and make promises to others you can't keep. It's easy to exaggerate your expertise or time while you're feeling like you can take on the world. Instead, you should direct this creative mindset toward making a vision board for your career aspirations or by updating your resume. This will help you build towards these dreams in an authentic way."
2021-02-06,"Our urges could own us today if we're not careful. When vulnerable Venus connects with stern Saturn at 2:07 am EST, we could feel separated from the people around us, easily falling into negative patterns with friends or loved ones. As the Moon squares Neptune later in the evening, our sensitivities can be raised to the point of hypercriticism or nervousness. With Venus in a tense embrace with Uranus short thereafter, we'll be prone to speaking or acting out of emotion. We should be kind and avoid the urge to point fingers, lest we find a few pointing back!","Be wary of putting someone on a pedestal right now. They say you shouldn't meet your heroes because you can become disillusioned once you realize they are flawed human beings. Perfection is nowhere to be found in real life, and it's better if you can be forgiving rather than exacting. If you've been holding someone in too high of a regard, try viewing them as a real person with as many challenges and fears as you have. It will help you to be more understanding of them -- and yourself.","Trust is a careful balance, and today you might see that you can't force it with someone and it must be earned through past actions and reliability. If you're wondering why it feels wrong to put faith into someone, look at their behavior and ask yourself if you've been giving out second chances too easily. Pay attention to who anxiously pursues you out of a desire to get your attention and who is truly trying to lend you their hand. They'll reveal themselves in time.","Tension could derail what you're trying to accomplish today. Someone might distract you from your studies, or you may be in fierce competition with a coworker who's getting in the way of your efforts. Your homework is to make sure you don't let what's in your immediate field of vision throw you off track. Keep your eyes pointed forward and on what really matters to you. You'll feel better at the end of the day if you're able to successfully dodge your distractors.","Your mantra today could be that routine is meant to be broken. Freewheeling isn't a winner every time, but you should try to give into some of the whims you have now. If you have a lot of drudge work to attend to, it might be difficult to stay focused. The best way to channel this scattered energy is to only attend to the subjects that really interest you. Once your mind is active, you'll be able to switch this mental power and put it toward the tasks that have to get done.","Sometimes you may feel like you're being inauthentic if you're not wearing your heart on your sleeve, but there's something to be said for saving your true self for those who deserve it. Even if you're put on the spot, don't feel like you have to perform. If you're not ready to reveal your feelings, don't allow others to goad you into giving up your innermost thoughts. You're the keeper of your heart and you decide who you give it away to.","If you've been feeling caught up in the drama of others and need some time for yourself, it's a good time to start a good habit -- or end a bad one. Don't let your significant other or family distract you from what it is you want today. Let them know you need a little time to yourself so you can exercise, organize, relax, or whatever else it is that makes you feel a little more at peace. Establishing boundaries is important to your wellbeing.","You'd be wise not to jump to conclusions today. There may be a moment in the day when you're doubting your trust in someone in your close circle, but you should avoid acting on these assumptions before you have all the facts. If someone is acting strangely, keep your suspicions to yourself until you have more evidence, and if you don't find more, it may be best to say nothing and keep it in your memory bank. Remember, innocent until proven guilty.","You might be feeling a little trapped under the responsibilities and routine of your everyday life right now, but try to fight the urge to run off into the woods. While it's not the most pleasant undertaking, getting your work out of the way first is key now. Once you end up finishing your to-do list, you'll have the rest of the day to yourself. Once you've taken care of business, the fun you have will be that much more rewarding.","Let any negativity roll off your shoulders today. It can be a little easier to take offense to a harsh comment, a backhanded compliment, or even a misplaced genuine compliment. Even though your skin might be feeling thinner under the current planetary energy, don't let the insecurities and missteps of others cause you to dim your light. Be your authentic self despite any perceived attacks, because for every outspoken critic, there is likely someone who admires your ability to be true to yourself.","Your intuition is high now, and you may not be able to explain everything you're thinking and feeling to others. If something feels off about a situation or you are no longer excited about something you committed to, follow your instincts and do what feels right emotionally. Your ability to feel secure is of tantamount importance, so trust your heart and your gut to lead you in the right direction. Your inner compass is always working to lead you to where you're supposed to go.","If you're feeling like an outcast or aren't sure where you fit in with a new group, it's OK to be unsure. However, remember that you've always been able to stand on your own. This is your strength, not your weakness. Keep doing what you're doing and don't try to mold yourself into a version of other people in the group. If you have to fake a little confidence at first, go ahead! Who you are is worthy of being seen, so relax into your true identity and enjoy yourself.","You must keep your eye on the prize today, and in this case, the prize is your vision for your life. You might feel like your aspirations are all tied up in the plans of others; in fact, it may seem like other people are actively planning your life for you. Take some of your power back and do something grounding that will remind you what your main focus should be. Once you've gotten yourself back on course, you'll feel more ready to take on the world -- on your own."
2021-02-07,"Today we could benefit from a stimulating and supportive space for communication, creativity, and community. When lovely Luna sextiles talkative Mercury early this morning, we'll be given a special ability to show others our thoughts with clarity and wit. The Moon will give us another boost at 3:52 pm EST when it transitions from philosophical Sagittarius to disciplined Capricorn. This is an excellent time to begin working on anything we've been tinkering with. Any plans we have that have been collecting dust will get the attention they deserve.","You may have a strong urge to network with others now, but it can be hard to meet people in the current climate. It's also possible that you feel like people have dropped away from your life, leaving an emotional hole that has been difficult to fill. Although connecting with new people can be awkward, there are ways to reach out to past acquaintances or to find others interested in your hobbies. Don't be scared to put yourself out there and make new friends.","If you've been wanting to elevate your image, now is the time. Making updates to your social media profiles or polishing your resume is the perfect way to bide your time while you're waiting for the next big step in your life. You can make an impact, but you will need to do it with a bit of style in order to get the result that you want. Fortunately, you already know how to impress with your charm and sense of humor. Let your personality shine through and watch the opportunities flow.","You might be dwelling on something from your past, like a relationship, a friendship, or even a missed opportunity of some kind. Whatever is playing on your mind, it's time to let it go and let the universe take care of it. It's out of your hands now, and you did the best that you could. Allow yourself to move on emotionally and mentally so you can prepare for the next chapter of your life. Ending what needs to be ended paves the way for your future.","It's possible you've been making unfair demands of someone, or it might be that a friend or loved one has been holding you to impossible standards. Now is an excellent time to balance the scales and create more equity between the two of you. If one side has been bearing the emotional bulk or making more of an effort, try to delicately bring attention to this issue. You both deserve to have a healthy give and take in your relationship.","All the world's a stage with you, and the stage might be a little bit messy under the current planetary transits. This could be an emotional messiness, or it could be physical disarray in your home or workspace that requires a little bit of elbow grease to look tidy again. Whatever it is, make a pact with yourself to create a space that is deserving of the star you are. Only then will you be ready to shine.","You may have been working yourself to the bone to keep everything together, and your mind is still stuck in work mode even when you're at home. Find a way to snap your brain out of the office once you're done for the day, because it's not healthy to be there mentally all the time. Give yourself a mental vacation by taking a relaxing bath, putting on some music, or finding another way to unwind. You deserve a little time to yourself every day to unplug.","If you live with family or roommates, now is a good time to engage in an activity that you can all do together. Watching a movie, cooking dinner, or playing a game could be a fun way to bond and make memories together. If you live alone, give a family member or a close friend a call and reminisce about the good times together. No matter how near or far you are from others, there are still ways to cherish your favorite memories while making new ones.","You aren't normally the most talkative person, but right now you know what you want to say, and nervous energy will collect if you keep it inside. If you're not sure who to share these thoughts with, you can write them down in a journal. Getting these ideas and daydreams out of your head and into words, whether they are out loud or on paper, will be highly cathartic for you, helping you understand yourself better. It's time to set these ideas free.","It's easy to slip into feeling like there aren't as many good people in the world anymore, as we're often bombarded with images of people committing negative actions through the news and other media. Spend time today thinking about what friends or strangers may have done in the past to make you feel safer or times you saw somebody stick up for someone else. Give some thought to these people and how you can be more like them. Even the smallest acts of kindness make an impact.","Your emotional sensitivity may be running high now, but your ability to be sincere and vulnerable without caring what others think is your advantage. When you own the parts of you that may not be considered popular or palatable, you are able to be truly honest. You'll never be able to please the entire crowd, so you might as well be happy with yourself and do what makes you happiest, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. Don't be afraid to open up your heart.","You might find yourself feeling restless about something but not understanding where this restlessness is coming from. Don't worry about it too much, as a little uncertainty is just a part of life. You can't know everything right away, and if everything happened for you instantly, you'd never get to experience the beauty of anticipation. Instead, enjoy the journey instead of wishing it were over. Soon enough you'll know the answer, but for now, it's OK to sit with the unknown.","If you're looking for something, make sure that it's something you're prepared to find. Sometimes we think we know what we want out of life, but when we finally get it, we're not quite sure what to do with it. Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who just got all the things you've been wishing for in your heart. Now imagine it's the next day. What would you do then? After visualizing this scenario, you'll have a clearer idea of whether this is something you really do want."
2021-02-08,"We'll think and move with a different attitude today. Negativity and fear will give way to flexibility and boldness when the evocative Moon trines radical Uranus, allowing us to change our minds if we want to. When the Sun unites with cerebral Mercury at 8:48 am EST, we'll be more mentally active and will find it easier to share our true thoughts with others. Fortunately, the Moon's trine to dynamic Mars later in the evening helps us defend our ideals with bravery and decisiveness.","You may be feeling unsure of what you're putting out into the world or your ideas, but what sets you apart from others is your unique ability to know what's right for you and what isn't. Instead of pretending to go along with the crowd, have confidence in your personal style. If you can be authentic, decisive, and kind while calling it like you see it, you can impress important people in your life. Bravery is your secret weapon right now.","You are in a position now where you might not be sure if you have anything to offer the world. Ignore this imposter syndrome and trust in your ability to calmly and thoughtfully explain things so others can understand what you've already mastered. Your willingness to assist is what makes you stand out from the crowd, because being able to bring others up to where you are is admirable. Help others out and you will soon see how the help that you give cycles back around to you.","Today might be a day when you get in touch with your spiritual side. You may feel instinctively led to a book or a movie that could help connect you with your personal destiny in some way. Follow this hunch, as you could be rewarded with inspiration on how to deal with a problem in your life, or it may answer a question that can be difficult to resolve through regular conversation. Open up and let the universe be your guide now.","Collaboration is going to be key for you today. You may find yourself relying on the help of others and you're not sure if you can let go of the reins and allow someone else take charge. It's OK to let others help and inspire you, as two heads are always better than one. This person could have outspoken opinions or brash deliveries, but look for the kernel of truth in what they're saying before you dismiss them. You don't have to do it all alone.","You may have had unplanned changes at work or in your daily routine recently, and you're not quite sure how to feel about it. Sometimes we need our familiar surroundings shaken up a little in order to keep things fresh. You won't grow by doing the same exact thing every day, and sometimes we're given what we need even if we don't want it. Instead of sweating the small stuff and trying to resist these changes, evolve with them and watch yourself bloom.","It's possible you'll hear something that causes you to blow your top today, but instead of reacting in the moment, take a second to compose yourself and behave in a way you'd be proud of later on. If you find that you need to blow off some steam to help you move past this situation, engage in something that serves as a needed distraction. Not only will it help liberate you from your circumstances, it will also liberate you from your anger.","You might feel lucky under the current planetary energy, and you can see this luck come to you through your family or friends who feel like family. It's possible you'll receive a message from a loved one out of the blue or find someone handing you a late present they had meant to give you a few months ago. Be open to the events that happen outside of your plans right now and trust in fun surprises, because they might be the best part of your day.","Words of wisdom could be coming your way today. Even if you like to march to the beat of your own drum, there's always something to gain from those around you. Some of the best lessons are born of other people's missteps, so be open to listening and learning from people you know. Encourage them to tell you stories about their past, observing what they say so you can avoid repeating these mistakes yourself. They'll enjoy talking about themselves, and you'll know you're getting free life advice.","You may find that you have enough money to do everything that you want to one day, but you may not have enough energy or time to do it all. That's why you must be willing to make hard decisions and part with the things you don't have the time for right now. Remember, your rest and your health both should be priorities, otherwise you'll be forced to slow down when you least expect it. Your future self will thank you for reserving your energy for what's most important.","You'll get the most out of the day by rewarding yourself for working so hard and by acknowledging how reliable and steady of a person you are. You may normally put off giving yourself a pat on the back so you can keep things moving, but little acts of gratitude toward yourself will help to keep you from completely burning out. Life is about more than long stretches of all work and no play. Give yourself the gift of leisure today.","You may be immersed in deep inner work, especially regarding family matters and how they've shaped you over time. If you look at the harder sides of your life and understand that they weren't easy but they helped make you a more complex and compassionate person, you can love these darker sides of yourself and accept them without continuing their patterns. You know who you want to be now, but that doesn't mean you have to hate who you used to be.","An outside view you receive today could help you better appreciate yourself -- and bolster your confidence. It may not be easy to ask another person how they perceive you, but try to see if you can put yourself in their shoes while talking to them. This could create a clearer self-image, allowing you to comprehend what it's like to meet yourself for the first time. You won't even need to make a conscious decision to love yourself, because you'll see you've been worthy all along."
2021-02-09,"The lens through which we see the world is transforming. The structures of our inner lives are in focus as the introspective Moon moves through Capricorn, and her sextile to dreamy Neptune today allows us to imagine a better way of living internally. Luna's conjunction to metamorphic Pluto then helps us to work through our sentimental attachments to old ideas and set them free so we can build a new outlook. Once the Moon enters brilliant Aquarius at 8:20 pm EST, we’ll be ready to debut our new viewpoint to the world.","Pay attention to how you are operating in and about the workforce. Although you may dread going to work every day and spend the hours wishing you were somewhere else, it's possible you've given up on looking for something better. Today, it’s time to adjust your mindset and look for a career that brings you a real sense of fulfillment. Even if you don’t find it right away, keep the faith and begin articulating a plan in your mind to get where you want to go.","Although the world still feels limited, there's an infinite number of topics you can learn and explore from home. You will grow mentally stagnant if you get stuck in a repetitive loop of work and relaxation, so find a way to excite and grow your mind today! Not only will this satisfy a craving for adventure, but the knowledge or skills you learn could also benefit you in the future. The more you know, the more opportunities you create for yourself.","Although you’ve been hurt in the past, this doesn’t mean that you should shut yourself off to new connections that are growing deeper. You may be holding someone at arm’s length, and they’re confused by your level of distance. Don’t let fear get in the way of trust. It’s okay to let them in a little -- you don’t have to rush into your entire life story. Know your emotional boundaries, but make sure that self-protection doesn’t turn into a refusal to live life.","Be aware of those who receive without ever giving back. You’re generous with your time and effort, but you may be pouring your energy into someone who has no intentions of giving you the same energy in return. If you find that you need help from someone today who’s refusing to provide it -- even though you’ve been there for them in the past -- then you may need to allow this person less time in your life. Save your energy for people who appreciate it.","While work or errands may be a bit of a hassle today, pay attention to who you can depend on when everything around you is chaos. Observe others and how they act during frustrating streaks at work or in terrible traffic. Who remains calm, who steps up, and who crumbles under the pressure? You’re a natural leader, so don’t shy away from taking charge, but be open to listening to others and working with the team rather than solely trying to direct them.","You may be feeling the urge to jump straight into a new hobby or relationship today -- you might even be a little obsessed with this new interest. Therefore, you'll need to be careful that this passion doesn’t take over your life, causing you to neglect important people and halt the progress you've been making. What you already have is worth holding on to, so keep your mind focused rather than being lured away by something shiny and mysterious.","Emotional discipline is an asset of yours, but you may be building toward a blow-up... Although you’re good at holding yourself together, it can be exhausting to have to do so all the time. Just because you suppress these emotions doesn’t mean that they go away... Find a way to channel these hidden responses into exercise or creativity. Sometimes it’s not easy to explain how you feel in words, even to yourself, so an energetic outlet can help.","Where are you holding on too tightly? Scorpios have a tendency to hold on to situations or items far after they are no longer emotionally fulfilling, and having to carry all of this around may be draining you now. Be open to letting go of something that has been weighing on you, whether this is a closet full of clothes you don’t wear anymore or a grudge from a lost connection long ago. Give yourself the gift of living lightly.","Don't panic if an unexpected bill arrives today or if you have a nagging feeling about a home repair that needs to be made. Just tackle these issues as they come up rather than procrastinating and, if you feel stuck, ask someone that you trust for help. It can be hard to swallow your pride and reach out, but you can't always do it alone. Alternatively, if you see someone in need and you’re in a position to help today, come to the rescue!","Your aura is so intense right now that others can feel the emotional forces around you even if you don’t say anything. Therefore, make sure you’re not misdirecting your feelings and taking out work stress on the innocent bystanders in your life, like friends and family. It’s okay to acknowledge your feelings rather than repress them, but you are still responsible for how you conduct yourself. It may help to go for a brisk walk or meditate through the emotional waves.","Deep revelations are in store for you today. You may be struck with memories surrounding powerful, transformational times in your life, and this is because you are heading for a new transformational period that will help you get to the next phase of growth. This requires you to dissolve your ideas of comfort and safety for a moment so that you can dream of a better life that you haven’t yet experienced. Let go of what is familiar and remember other times you adapted to completely new environments.","It feels like you're playing a mental game of musical chairs today, considering how people in your circle are moving. Power struggles or obsessive behavior may surface, even with people who you thought were solid. Emotional situations can bring out a different side to the people around you, so watch out for true colors when they show themselves. Without causing a big display, remain in observation mode and avoid any attempts to control others. You can benefit greatly from what you see and learn today."
2021-02-10,"The communal energy in the air is electric today. When mental Mercury forms a tense square with warrior Mars at 7:16 am EST, our drive to protect our cultural legacy and traditions wrestles with our need to move forward into the future. What is holding us back and what are we rushing into too quickly? We must consider what’s best for everyone as the harmonious Moon forms conjunctions with realistic Saturn, fair Venus, and philosophical Jupiter, all in collective Aquarius. Expect to end the day on an optimistic note!","You will have an opportunity to help out your fellow person today, and you won’t want to miss it. Oddly, you may feel driven to protect yourself and all that you’ve worked to build for your loved ones, but at the same time, compelled to give back some of what you’ve gained to someone less fortunate. You’re not required to give more time or resources than you’re able to, but if you can give at all, now is a great time to lend a helping hand.","You have an opportunity to command the attention of your peers today, but speak with caution and be aware of how you represent yourself, because others might misinterpret the way you feel. If you go in unprepared, you will miss your chance to make an emotional impact. Present yourself in your most graceful yet powerful light so that your words are more likely to be absorbed. Don't go so far as to be disingenuous, just put yourself in your audience’s shoes first!","Whatever you resist persists... There’s an emotional lesson that the universe keeps trying to teach you, and you may keep returning to this issue because you refuse to let go of a tightly-held viewpoint. Ask yourself, how does this certain mindset benefit you if it keeps leading you back to this negative, repetitive cycle? Don’t force trust in a person or a situation where you know it no longer belongs. Shift your thinking to new horizons so that you can begin to break the pattern.","True friends will separate themselves from your acquaintances now. You may find that you’re reaching out for a lifeline today, but you can only see a hand or two are reaching back where you thought there would be many. In reality, you’re lucky in life to have a few friends that you can count on when it really matters. Be thankful for these true blue people and remind yourself to stay aware of who is only a fair-weather friend.","If it's true that you inevitably become like the people you surround yourself with, are you happy to represent yourself in this way? You may have become idealistic with your self-image as of late, so take a step back and see if this person lines up with who you are in reality. If you’ve been putting off responsibility, rest, or personal goals because your pals encourage you to shirk them, you may need to crack the whip and put your true needs first today. You need support, not distraction.","You may get into a tizzy about work today, but just stop and rest for a moment. You’re always toiling to make things better for others, yet it can be exhausting to continuously fight against the chaos or heavy workload when you clock in each day. Remind yourself that you can’t pour from an empty cup and that it’s okay if you need a break. Don’t work yourself into the ground -- there will always be a new problem, but it’s not always your burden to bear!","You may need to lay some boundaries today or else you'll end the day fully drained. It will probably feel like people in your life are clamoring for your attention from hour to hour, which will run you ragged. You will need to make decide for yourself what you can and cannot give, and be firm. Do show up for the people that you’re able to show up for, just don’t make promises that you can’t keep.","Your home may feel as if it’s been turned into a chaotic arena today. This energy may represent something as simple as a messy living room or as complex as a family argument. If a little organization is all your home needs, get everyone who lives with you involved in the cleanup and then celebrate with something fun. If it's actually an emotional situation, make your feelings known gently, then step into the role of mediator -- you'll be able to keep things from getting out of hand.","You’re eager to move forward with life, but someone from your past may not appreciate the progress you’ve made since you’ve known them. Still, don't look backward at friendships, romances, or work situations that you moved away from for your benefit. Instead, look forward, because that’s the direction you're going! Pay close attention to your surroundings throughout the day and keep your eye out for new connections. Careful actions and fast reflexes will help you to succeed, so stay on your toes.","You may need to re-evaluate your finances today, especially if you’re planning on making a big purchase. Before you spend money on the fun and frivolous side of life, make sure that your bills are paid and that you have a little stashed for a rainy day. Emotional spending can get the best of you today, so you would be wise to make a budget before you log on or enter a store, or else you might leave with a cart full of things you don't even want.","Your uniqueness is one of your strongest assets, yet today, you may find that others are pressuring you to conform. Still, you owe it to yourself to be authentic, as long as you’re not hurting anyone. Expressing your individual essence is what makes life interesting to you, so although it may be simpler to fade into the background, make a point to shine a little brighter than you usually try to. This doesn’t mean brag about yourself, just embrace your personal style with the self-respect that you deserve.","Hold on tight because today might be a little bit bumpy. You may feel like you’re being forced to ride an emotional roller coaster, yet you can still control how you react to the twists and turns. A friend or sibling may say or do something that triggers you, but speaking rashly will only end in hurt feelings or confused actions. Try to speak with thought and clarity, especially in debates. The more you can tap into your compassionate side, the better."
2021-02-11,"We are eager to look forward with six planets now moving through visionary Aquarius. We’re inspired to share our feelings about the future and how to build a better one with the people around us, especially as the heartfelt Moon conjuncts communicative Mercury today. We are also blessed by artistic Venus' conjunction to expansive Jupiter, which creates an accepting and generous atmosphere. This energy allows us to fully embrace the New Moon in Aquarius at 2:06 pm EST as it opens new doors for us as a collective.","Connections are favored now and it’s the perfect time to network and get people talking about what you’re making happen in the world. Technology is on your side so use it to your advantage -- you'll reach a much broader audience online or over email than you will by word of mouth. This is also a great day to connect with good, authentic friends who allow you to be yourself. Make it a point to share your views, listen well, and broaden your horizons.","Ambition is key to your professional success right now, and you don’t even need that much! Just imagine your dream job today and begin working toward making that your reality, even in small ways. Start dropping hints that you're interested in advancing in your current career, or send your resume to the place you would work if you could work anywhere. There’s no one holding you back and your reliable and capable nature is a strong asset, so go for it!","You may be feeling a great urge to break out of a box today and breathe in something new. This is a great time to learn a skill or subject where you can work at your own pace. Make sure it's something you're actually interested in so you want to stick with it. Studying philosophical and spiritual ideas will also help you get in touch with your inner self now. If you don’t feel like cracking open a book, spend some time in nature to tune into your soul.","It’s time to shed your old skin in order to debut your new self. You’ve been evolving, but it seems that something is holding you back from stepping fully into your new form. It’s time to finally say goodbye to this burden that you’ve been holding on to -- this may be a lost relationship, a negative mindset, or a box of items from your past that needs to go. Trust that the future holds new gifts that need space in your life!","Fresh faces are entering the picture and offering you an opportunity to expand your circle. Be open to meeting new people as well as talking with old friends now, because your interpersonal relationships hold the most benefits for you. Expect laughter and interesting stories to fill your day -- you might even meet someone who ends up remaining in your life for a long time. You can never have too many people in your support system.","You’ve got time on your side today! You're in such an efficient phase that, without even trying, it'll feel like you have more time than normal to finish all your responsibilities -- but with a little planning or budgeting, things will go even more smoothly! You may want to spend your extra time tackling a messy room that’s been on your radar, or having a home spa day to rejuvenate your energy. Whatever you decide to do, make sure it contributes to your health and well-being.","Can you feel the luck in the air? The stage is set for you to create something out of nothing now -- taking a risk could lead to a very rewarding outcome. This is a wonderful time to redecorate or to delve into a creative project, but if you’re not interested in getting out the paints and paintbrushes, the air is still full of fun and excitement. If you have children in your life, you can make magical memories with them under the current planetary energy, so go play!","Listen to your heart today -- it will take you in the right direction when it comes to helping others. Your intuition is heightened now and your ability to be a sensitive listener can bring comfort to someone important in your life. This may be a family member or a good friend who you’ve known a long time. When this person lays their troubles down at your feet, be compassionate and they will be thankful for your empathy. Sharing this gentle energy will bring comfort to you as well.","Good news travels fast, and it’s headed your way next. Expect this day to be full of hustle and bustle for you, but with pleasant surprises at every turn. You’re bound to be communicating with all types of people as you go through your daily routine, and everyone has a little interesting tidbit of information or a little hint at something good that’s coming. Let these positive interactions fuel your optimism and create your next positive step by incorporating what you’ve learned into your plans.","Stability is replacing uncertainty, and not a moment too soon. You may have felt unsure of a project or a relationship you are involved in, but now the red light has turned to green and you should start to see the results of your hard work and dedication. Someone may finally show you that they reciprocate your feelings, or perhaps a financial investment begins to show dividends after a slow climb. Whatever your reward, know that it's a direct result of your effort and patience.","A personal evolution is in order! You owe it to yourself to focus on what you have going on, especially with so many planets in your sign right now. Even if the spotlight feels foreign and unfamiliar, you know that you have the abilities you need to succeed and this is the opportune time to show the world what you can do. This is also a favorable time for a fresh look, so you’ve been thinking about a new haircut or clothing style, go ahead and take the plunge.","Your intuitive abilities are peaking right now and you may find yourself receiving answers to deep questions through channels that you can’t explain. When you go to sleep, make a note to remember your dreams and look up the symbolism the next day. Or, turn to a page in an old journal and see if looking backward doesn’t help you see forward. Whatever you do, keep your mind open so these insights have a way to reach you."
2021-02-12,"Magic is all around us, we just need to look for it in unexpected places. The sensitive Moon enters spiritual Pisces at 2:23 am EST, making it more difficult to verbalize how we feel, but easier to connect to our emotions on a peaceful and instinctual level. We can begin to let go of emotional setbacks that linger in the back of our minds when the Moon then sextiles change-maker Uranus. Flashes of inspiration will help us to see a path forward.","Something that was hidden from you in the past -- or something that you’ve hidden from someone else -- may surface today, in order to provide closure for you and for others in your life. If this is not the case for you, then this could reflect an opportunity to be honest with someone about how you feel about them. It’s okay to take a bit of a risk today, as long as you’re coming from an open and healthy place emotionally.","Standing out from the crowd can be a great thing, as long as you’re being yourself. You may have changed quite a bit over this past year and you could be finding that certain acquaintances are no longer interested in your company or are trying to change you back to who you used to be. Unfortunately for them, if you like the person you are now, there’s no reason for you to have to fit into a box that they’ve made for you. Embrace your personal changes proudly!","You may have done a lot to keep your work persona and your private persona separate, but your work persona could be starting to feel stale. Revamp how you market yourself when it comes to professional networking and maybe reveal a bit more about who you are personally. You don’t have to be a completely different person when you're on the clock; it will make it easier for others to connect with you if they know the real you.","You might be fixated today on retaining something or someone that you don’t want to lose, especially related to your long-held beliefs or personal morals. If you hold on to tradition too tightly, though, you may miss the happiness that's in front of you. It's good to have such steadfast principles, but ask yourself if these beliefs are really helping you or hurting you. You can allow the truth into your life with a little gentle help from people who love you.","You may experience a eureka moment today that leads you to realize that you’ve been acting one way but feeling another. If you’re not living in alignment with your truth, then what are you waiting for? If you’re waiting to discover what that truth is, take a moment to yourself and reflect on your thoughts and actions throughout each day. What’s not matching up? Once you can say what you truly feel and believe in what you say, you’ll see life opening up more.","Attention is being drawn to you and you can use this to your advantage. You might have noticed someone paying you more notice, whether in a friendly or romantic sense or in a career endeavor, and you need to follow up now in order to get a better outcome. Putting yourself out there and taking the initiative will pay off, even if you’re more comfortable watching and waiting to see what they say. You know what your heart truly wants out of this situation, so no more hiding yourself away.","You might be so caught up in your routine or your errands lately that you’ve been unable to connect with the people around you. Make an attempt to slow down your rapid pace, and if you’re not able to, find a way to make time for others next week. A life completely immersed in work and keeping the wheels turning will eventually cause you to burn out, so give yourself permission to rest a little with those who love you.","There may be a situation or person that’s asking you to commit right now, but inside, you’re not sure if it’s what you really want. Rather than rushing into something and regretting it later, spend some time today making a list of pros and cons. When you’re looking at the piece of paper, check in with your intuition and consider what feels right for you. Whatever decision you make, remember that it’s your life and your choice.","An unexpected occurrence could change your whole day today. Your routine is likely to be thrown off by some unforeseen detour, or your energy might be inexplicably low despite the amount of things you have on your to-do list. It’s up to you whether you want to stick to the script as much as possible or freeform your responsibilities. Both options are likely to have the same outcome, but you might relieve some of your stress by not trying to control the situation.","Distractions are on their way to you, but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing! While a busy day that’s been tightly scheduled might be thrown off by this, if you can get your work out of the way early, you can indulge in one of these distractions. Be open to accepting fun invitations from friends, even if it's something as simple as an online happy hour to catch up. Connecting with others and giving your mind a break from responsibility will be very beneficial to you now.","Home has taken on a whole new meaning this past year, and by now the energy here may be growing stagnant. Whether you're spending every moment at home or it's the space you return to after a long day, it's important that it bring you the comfort, inspiration, and nourishment you need to feel balanced. A few simple updates like adding new plants or getting rid of an old piece of furniture will breathe new life into your home now and, in turn, into you.","It's important that you re-evaluate the way you talk about and to yourself right now. What is the energy behind the things you tell yourself when no one else is around? If it’s mostly critical, make a note to start changing that little by little. It’s okay to have the negative thought, and sit with it for a moment, but then let yourself know that you’re letting go of this attitude toward yourself. What you think, you become, so be your own biggest cheerleader."
2021-02-13,"A breezy atmosphere of contentment arrives today, soothing our souls and helping us connect with others. Playful Mercury's conjunction with harmonizing Venus gives us the chance to experience heartfelt conversations and laughter, while the gentle Moon's conjunction with dreamy Neptune helps us to see the creative and magical opportunities we can share with loved ones. Finally, active Mars sextiles Neptune at 9:13 pm EST, putting action behind our dreams and giving us a lasso to catch and pull them down to reality.","Your friends and your community are showing up for you now, even if you weren’t expecting a helping hand. It may be difficult to express how you feel, but try to show them that you appreciate their contribution in the best way you know how. This can be something as simple as a handwritten thank-you note or the willingness to help them when they’re in need. Whatever you can do to show gratitude will push you forward into a loving cycle of giving and receiving.","Your confidence is high today and people are willing to follow your leadership if you’re willing to show up for them in a way that benefits all of you. You have a certain bravado that you can harness now, but don’t let yourself get cocky. If you aren’t able to show appreciation for the people who are willing to give up their instincts and follow your lead, then you’ll find yourself with no one standing in support.","You may find yourself landing outside of your comfort zone, but this is where you belong right now. You won’t find what you’re looking for without doing a little searching, yet searching where you’ve been searching won't yield any more results. Look a little further outside the realm of possibilities that you’ve created for yourself, and you may find that you’re letting your own mental barriers keep you from thriving. Throw off your blinders and look at your options with new eyes.","Some alone time will do you good today; you need a chance to cleanse yourself from all the outside opinions that have been foisted on you by others. You have been there for people quite a lot recently, and they’ve had no shortage of thoughts and feelings that they wanted to share. If you weren’t heard by these people in return, then it may be time to prioritize your own goals and rethink how much of your time belongs to the demands of others.","Real friends are worth their weight in gold. It looks like you could receive a lucky windfall or some good news today, and you’ll want to share it with someone who you know will be happy for you. Keep this good news out of the ears of jealous or negative people, though, and have the discernment to know who’s asking about you because they care and who’s just looking for gossip. Not everyone who compliments you has your best interests at heart, so stay sharp.","Fresh energy is here for the taking! If you’ve fallen behind in organization or the atmosphere around you is feeling dreary, this is a wonderful time to air out your space and bring beauty back into your life. Clean up those abandoned messes and add some fresh colors that inspire you. If you have a vision board, reimagine it so that it better reflects the goals you have right now. Every bit of energy you put into improving your life pays off.","You'd be wise to catch up on some much needed rest today. Don’t overexert yourself -- prioritize your health so that you come out that much stronger tomorrow. There may be many people or situations vying for your attention, but before you agree to spread yourself thin, ask yourself if you really want these situations in your life or if you are overdoing it just to keep everyone happy. Instead of turning the day into a blur, choose peace.","Home is where your heart and soul are right now. You may find that you want to cozy up by yourself and spend the day getting lost in hobbies or entertainment -- there’s nothing wrong with a little escape from reality from time to time. If you have obligations on your schedule and people are depending on you, though, be careful you don’t daydream straight through them. Take care of your responsibilities early so you have the freedom to sink into your imagination.","The best parts of your day will come in the form of words of affirmation, so allow others to compliment you without shying away from what they have to say. It’s okay to accept praise, and the ability to do so graciously is a skill that few develop. Make a mental note to not tear yourself down in response to gratitude or praise given to you. Instead, thank them for their kind words and let them know how much they mean to you.","You’re seeing blessings pouring in, so how can you help to spread joy to those around you? You may feel called to give to charity today or to help out a friend to make their life a little easier. Or, you may find that it's actually you who needs help with something. If so, call on someone that you feel safe with when it comes to asking for assistance. Although they may expect nothing in return, showing your gratitude will encourage this cycle of generosity.","You'll probably be enticed by several different opportunities for fun and extravagance today, but don’t forget the bill that comes afterward! You'd be smart to check and double check your bank account, because a hidden cost could crop up and surprise you. As long as you don’t let your spending get out of hand or forget to pay your bills, though, this is an excellent time for upgrading your look and feeling more comfortable in your own skin.","Real life might not feel very appealing today, but you'd rather look at the bright side than at harsh realities. Sometimes we all need a break from bad news, and it’s okay to get lost in a heartwarming book or a compelling movie in order to inspire yourself back into action. While it won’t do you much good to try and communicate these ideals to naysayers, let the knowledge that good still exists in the world give you peace and newfound courage."
2021-02-14,"Freedom and forward momentum are available to us all today. As the emotional Moon forms a supportive sextile to ever-evolving Pluto, we can shed our fears and past failures to put on a brave face for the future. The Moon then moves forward into pioneering Aries, allowing us to shake off the cobwebs of uncertainty and burst out into the sunlight. Meanwhile, talkative Mercury's conjunction to philosophical Jupiter helps us to better understand one another and find joy in exchanging ideas with our fellow people.","Although you embrace your personality with confidence, it's possible that your inner self is not fully aligned with your outer self. If you find you are hiding how you really feel all the time, you are actually shrinking yourself in order to make yourself more palatable for others. While this isn’t a call to share all of your business, if there’s something that you’ve bitten your tongue over more than once, it might be time to bring it out into the open. You’ll feel much lighter afterwards.","The time has come to share your spiritual or creative notions with others without fear. Although you may feel shy bringing up your personal methods or viewpoints, they are your own and are just as meaningful as anyone else’s. You know what you believe and your opinions are needed and worthy, even if others try to make you feel small. Today, delve into your faith without the influence of others to hold you back. There's magic there for you.","You have a lot of opportunities today that will all be beneficial and informative, but you need to be discerning when it comes to what you give your time and effort to. Every excursion or educational experience sounds like it could better you in some way, but what areas do you actually need to improve? What would propel you toward the lifestyle that you want to be living? Whatever pops into your head when you see those questions, that is where to put your energy right now.","You’re stepping into a time in your life when others will look to you for guidance. It looks like you've been diligently studying and practicing something and you now have acquired new skills and knowledge that will be useful to yourself and others. But while you are feeling confident after so much mental and physical preparation, don’t let the power go to your head. Instead, be ready to show people why they can safely put their faith in you.","The people that you trust are also the ones who are able to break your heart... It can be difficult to wade through painful relationships to find quality ones, but you must have faith and maintain a gentle heart, for your own sake. To shut out others completely is a disservice to yourself and to the people who love you, but you can choose to be more selective with how much of your time you give to others. It’s a worthy pursuit to find people that have your back.","When the delicate balance of work and play is off in your life, something important is not getting the attention it deserves. Juggling family, friends, love, work, and time for yourself is not easy and it's okay if you've faltered a bit; what matters is that you try again and again until you find a lifestyle that fits you and the people that matter to you. Allow yourself the freedom to restructure your schedule and watch your life blossom.","You've got a winning edge today that could help you come out on top in whatever you attempt. You have a great chance to succeed in contests or competitions or to impress someone important with your skills. Show everyone what you're made of and don't hide your light while others pass you by. You have the chance to be a contender, so get to the starting line and show off the knowledge and talents that you're here to contribute.","Great wisdom can come to you from your family now, or from friends who feel like family. Although what they have to say may come as a surprise, it's less of a negative reaction to something that you've done and more of a cautionary tale. When others tell you stories from their past, listen and see what life advice you can gain from their actions and experiences. Remember, this is a time to ask questions and listen with attentiveness -- you might find that it keeps you out of trouble later.","Be open to generosity, because it looks like someone will surprise you with a gift or an act of service before the day is over. You may be in a big hurry with a thousand things to do, but keep an eye out for a pleasant interruption to your regularly scheduled life. Take a beat and be thankful for how the little deviations from your normal routine can turn out to be the special parts of life that you remember most.","Something's been shifting internally for you lately and you're probably beginning to feel it. This is a call to own your personal power and to use it to help get what you need to live happily. You may sometimes pull back on your drive so that you don't overpower others, but while it's good to be gracious, your desires are important, too. You will know when it's something that you really want, and you'll need to give it your all to prevent yourself from having regrets in the future.","You're overflowing with good ideas, but are you directing this energy in the right direction? You have the potential to use your creativity to bring in new money right now, either as a side hustle or even selling some items that you don't need anymore. If you aren't actively using the sparks of imagination that you've been given to bring in new channels of income, at least write down these ideas for the future. You never know when they'll be of great use!","You've been in a period of growth and change for quite a while, and while you may not be aware of the effects that these changes have had on you, you can probably look back at who you were a year ago and see the changes quite vividly. The people that you surround yourself with have also changed, and it's time to reflect on the differences between the past you and the present you. Knowing yourself now allows you to consciously create the future you."
2021-02-15,"Emotional healing flows into our inner lives as the sensitive Moon forms four supportive sextiles throughout the day. We will truly come to understand the refreshing energy of the Aries Moon, first in her connection to hardworking Saturn, which gives us renewed determination and perseverance. Luna's later angle to intelligent Mercury helps us connect with people through knowledge while her angle to philosophical Jupiter allows us to connect on a spiritual level. The Moon's final sextile to heartfelt Venus soothes any tensions and allows love to flow in.","Today you have opportunities to learn more about yourself and how you fit into the community you have grown to love. As the Moon is energized in your sign, you may find that your self-esteem receives a boost from friends and that you have refreshed confidence to take on the challenges of every day. It's likely someone will even offer to do you a favor in relation to your appearance. Express your authentic self and appreciate your cheerleaders!","You are incredibly intuitive right now when it comes to your career and how you’re perceived by others; you’re able to see all the progress that you’ve made, despite setbacks. You have so much to offer and your loyal and resilient nature makes you indispensable, so make sure that other people know! Update your resume and your online profiles and allow your creativity and sensitivity to shine through when describing yourself and your achievements. You never know whose eye you'll catch.","It's quite likely you've felt stuck in a mental rut lately, so let your curiosity find something new and interesting to delve into today. Go on a journey of knowledge that takes you far away from the everyday: learn about something that happened in another time, another culture, or in a belief system you're unfamiliar with. This will give you something new to talk about and keep you away from idle gossip. There’s so much more out there to learn that will enrich your mind, why think small?","Although you tend to be a creature of comfort, letting go of control could be very beneficial to you now. You might be used to keeping your finances under lock and key to maintain a sense of security, but this is a quality time to consider some investing, handing over the reins and the responsibilities to experts who will make good use of your money. That way, instead of working harder to make more money, your money will be working harder for you.","Although you are at the center of your universe, right now you may be so caught up in your own worldview or concerned with how people are perceiving you that you’re missing the bigger picture. In reality, the approval of others in regards to your appearance or status is less important than your character and how you emotionally impact those around you. Try to see things from other people's perspective today and be the kind, present, and thoughtful person you know you are.","You put your best into everything you do, however, perfection can be your biggest roadblock. How many times have you had a good idea and started working on it, only to leave it behind when the progress is less than what you had imagined? Today, take the fear of failure and change it into the realization that there is no failure, only first tries. First drafts are rarely flawless, so try to pick up one of your past ideas and see if you can bring new life to it.","Everything in your circle feels a bit over the top at the moment. You may find that others are more interested in your company as both new relationships and friendships grow. However, there could be a spark jealousy between the new people and old people in your life, and you will need to follow what your heart is telling you when it comes to how to divide your time and attention. Trust how you feel and don’t allow anyone to use your emotions against you.","Your past is influencing your current habits, but is it influencing you in ways you want it to? We all begin as combinations of the viewpoints and mannerisms of impactful people in our lives, but there are some traits that you don’t wish to carry forward with you as you grow and heal. Make a pact with yourself today to consciously eliminate a harmful habit that you may have inherited from someone close to you and decide to choose a better future for yourself.","You are no stranger to being honest, but you may have felt stifled lately without any clear reason as to why. You could be feeling a duty to protect someone from the truth, yet it is worth it to tell them the reality of the situation, for their sake. If, however, there’s no confession weighing you down, then today can be a time of mental connection and mutual understanding. Others will appreciate your ability to be authentic and truthful while still being kind.","You may have been feeling uncertain of your foundation in life after a loss, but fresh avenues of financial wealth and abundance are yours for the taking if you pursue them now. This doesn’t mean to throw away the progress you’ve already made , rather, trim the dead weight and create new growth with the opportunities being provided to you now. It might not be exactly what you expected, but you’ll be thankful for this helping hand later on.","You’re a powerhouse right now, so channel this power wisely! There's a lot of attention on you and you're up for any challenge, but be sure that you’re not scattering your energy. If you’re simply swinging wildly at all the choices being presented to you, then you won’t be making a meaningful impact in any of them. Focus your efforts so that you're only doing things that spark your interest and make a point to be calm and realistic when making future commitments.","There are powers at work behind the scenes helping to bring new financial growth to your life, but for now, you will need to stay focused and diligent. Someone may be standing back and watching to see how you handle a difficult situation on your own, or there could be talks regarding your future in rooms that you aren’t currently in. Continue to work hard toward the dreams that you wish to see manifest and trust in what you can’t quite see yet."
2021-02-16,"A balance of power is required, and we can expect this imbalance to make itself known today. As the sensitive Moon squares chaotic Pluto, we may see emotional outbursts and crumbling facades that herald a messy start, but a brighter future. Thankfully, the Moon's supportive sextile to the confident Sun provides a harmonizing influence, helping us to build ourselves back up in the best way. When the Moon finally enters serene Taurus at 10:12 pm EST, our determination to create a better foundation begins to solidify.","It's time to break down the walls you've imagined in how you define yourself. Your public image may not be lining up with how you act and feel when you’re alone, and it’s difficult to exist in these spaces with falsity. Or, an issue could arise in the workplace today that causes you to feel insecure or inexperienced, with imposter syndrome creeping in. Remind yourself that there’s no way to please everyone and think of all the people who like and appreciate you for you.","A sense of nostalgia creeps in today, but not every memory is sweet and you may still be running through certain speeches that you never gave. Time can heal most wounds, but some take a little letting go on our parts. Know that you’re not losing anything by freeing these situations from your mind, because reliving them over and over only keeps you there. It’s for your own benefit to set down these negative memories where they were and move forward into a happier future.","Make a commitment to be trustworthy and kind today, because you never know what someone else is going through in secret. Think of every battle that you’ve faced alone and it may help you to understand the actions of someone else in your life today. This person may shut you out and cause you confusion, or they may be vulnerable to you in a way that you weren’t expecting. Whatever happens, try to react with gentleness and a willingness to listen.","You have an opportunity to make someone else's life easier and enhance your karma today. If a person that you relied on in the past needs your help, do what you can to lend a hand. Even though you were looking forward to doing something else, your assistance will make a bigger impact for them than you know. Don't feel like you have to give more than you're able, just be honest about what you can provide and then do it with care.","It might be time to break up your routine and insert a little excitement into your schedule, especially if things are feeling stale or predictable. Don’t be reckless with your actions or words, but do plan a little escape from regular life today; give yourself permission to take time for yourself without input from others. Go to the park or drive to nowhere in particular -- anything that lets your imagination wander with no interruptions will be both liberating and energizing.","Sometimes the things that hold us back are our own doing... The universe is providing you with a lot of support to eliminate bad habits today -- especially ones that feel fun but are not very good for your health. Even if you start turning these habits into activities enjoyed in moderation, this is a good time to make the commitment to replace indulgent behaviors with healthy ones to create more balance in your life. Your body deserves the same top-notch focus and care that you give to everything else.","Your family or close loved ones may be pushing your buttons today, but don't pick any fights that you’re not willing to finish. There is a powerful push for control that you don’t have to submit to, and you may be in for a much longer debate if you refuse to budge. If you’re able to discern the difference between someone who truly wants to learn and grow from a discussion and someone who just wants to hear themselves talk, you will know which conversations deserve your energy.","Something you said in the past may come back to haunt you today. If you promised to do something that has not quite come to fruition or you overexaggerated a situation, you could be called to task and have to defend your words or actions. Be willing to accept responsibility if it is yours to bear, and if you’ve been struggling to handle all of what life has been throwing at you, be honest about that as well. Accept grace and commit to proving yourself next time.","Areas of life you thought were secure may feel like they’re on shaky ground right now, but don’t allow fear to lead your imagination to negative assumptions. Jumping to conclusions is one of the worst things you can do under the current energies, so if you need to take a moment to think through something before you react to it, go ahead and do that. Acting on half-baked thoughts and feelings will only add to the stress and confusion -- figure out where you stand.","Small actions could trigger big reactions if you’re not careful... You aren't in the mood to be messed with today and you might end up directing some misguided emotions at the wrong person if they push too many of your buttons. Try to give yourself an emotional outlet for this frustrated energy, perhaps with exercise or a calming mantra. Bottling up everything you feel inside ultimately leads to an explosion, so give yourself space to release some of this building pressure.","To your surprise, a deeply held fear or a secret of yours may be revealed today. It could be that your subconscious mind is so fixated on this idea that you, yourself, accidentally let it slip. If this personal information is revealed by someone else, however, do your best to react with grace rather than defensiveness and, above all, be forgiving of yourself. Self-criticism will not bring about positive change -- the less power you give to this situation, the freer you will feel.","Changing loyalties may cause upheaval in your circle of friends today. Arguments or emotional upheavals can crop up between people who were getting along swimmingly the day before, and while this may not involve you directly, you could still be asked to choose a side. If you decide to do so, do it cautiously and have a reason for making this choice. Your sincerity and compassion may not be rewarded initially, but with time, everyone will understand."
2021-02-17,"It’s time to get real and eliminate what is holding us back. There is already a certain anxiety that comes with letting go of what feels familiar, and today's rough square between the emotional Moon and enduring Saturn makes it difficult to give ourselves the freedom to change. At the same time, however, the Moon's conjunction with impulsive Uranus implores us to move on. When Saturn finally squares off with Uranus at 2:08 pm EST, it's a tug-of-war between our past and future and only our intuitions can guide us.","Impulsive decisions you make today may be met with disapproval from the people in your life. You'll have the option to take a risk, but be sure that you are ready to deal with the consequences if the odds aren't in your favor. If this is something you've worked hard toward, this can still be a leap you want to take -- just take a beat before you commit to anything and don't gamble with anything that you're not truly prepared to lose.","Past and present versions of you are converging today. While you could find yourself tending toward old behaviors and people from your past, the future is asking you to bring something new into your life. This change must be accepted by you internally, and while you can integrate some parts of the old you, you know which parts must be left behind in order to reach your long-term goals. Instead of looking at it as ""then"" and ""now,"" try to pull back and consider the complete trajectory you're on.","What you're being told and what you've learned through personal experience are at odds now. You may think there's not much evidence for what you're feeling or seeing, but if your intuition is firing warning signals, pay attention. If you feel that someone in your midst is being less than honest or simply ignorant to the truth, being involved with them may not be wise. It's perfectly okay to come to a fork in the road and choose the other path.","The people around you are suddenly emotionally reacting to each other and you're caught in the midst of it. It may feel like old power dynamics are battling with new ones. While it's a meaningful gesture to try to play the role of mediator, the intense energy will likely block any attempts at peace on your part. You might rather hold down the fort and avoid incoming stress by laying low and trying to pick up the pieces another day.","The way people see you is changing. Perhaps you've made a lifestyle change that's benefiting you, but it's also causing you to want to leave certain situations or people behind. They aren't quite ready to let go of you, though, and they want to prove themselves to you now. Whether you decide to gamble with the prospect of newfound happiness in old situations is up to you, just remember: we are often a combination of the people we surround ourselves with, so choose people you want to be like.","You could find yourself swept up in a whirlwind adventure today -- perhaps a real excursion or maybe just a vivid daydream -- but suddenly, reality calls you back to tend to the responsible side of life. Instead of letting disappointment sink in, find your inner focus and direct it at the obligations that are getting in your way. If you buckle down with purpose and efficiency, there will still be time to get back to what you really want to be doing.","A hidden cost or delayed charge could come as a surprise, so you may want to hold off if you were about to splurge on something extravagant today. The universe is asking that you make the responsible choice and try to have fun in a way that doesn't break the bank. Temptations abound in the form of entertainment and gifts for others, but hold tight -- when a rainy day comes, you'll be relieved to have this money on hand.","Relationships are in a state of transformation for you. If a friendship or partnership is feeling stagnant emotionally, try to be sensitive to the other person and find something enjoyable for you both to do together. Take the reins and propose an activity that will have a reward you can share at the end, like baking cookies. Don't just fall back on what you're used to doing -- mixing things up will inject some much-needed curiosity and intrigue back into your life.","It’s time to re-evaluate how you spend your time when you're alone. Are you able to be present in the moment, or do you find yourself lost in thoughts about other people, times, and situations in your life? Perhaps your thoughts are caught in past memories or projected far into the future in theoretical situations... Today is a converging moment: Releasing ideas of the past will help bring you into the present, allowing you to take a focused step toward the future your mind is imagining.","You could be feeling an urge to flee -- just make sure that you’re ready to leave behind whatever you’re running away from. It would be easy to impulsively cut ties with something that has lost sparkle for you, but sit with your honest thoughts and feelings before taking off. You can be hyper-critical of the people and situations in your life right now, yet if you raise your standards so high that no one can meet them, you will end up isolating yourself. Open up to understanding.","By trying to keep everything calm and everyone happy, you are restricting yourself from the things you need. If you tend to sacrifice or compartmentalize your feelings in order to make life easier, it's only a matter of time before these true feelings come out on their own. Set an intention to express yourself to the close people in your life today. Don’t think of it as destroying the peace, rather, a healthy and positive change that requires some disruption.","Your thoughts and emotions may be all over the place today, making it difficult to express or explain yourself to others. If you can sense that someone is not catching on to what you’re trying to say, see if you can express yourself in a more concise way. Or, if you’re feeling too scattered, it’s okay to take time for yourself and collect your thoughts. Don’t let anyone rush you into a reply, just take everything at a comfortable pace."
2021-02-18,"Disagreements of the head and the heart leave us stuck in the middle as the emotional Moon forms conflicting squares with both philosophical Jupiter and sentimental Venus. However, when the Sun enters Pisces at 5:44 am EST, we are invited on a more soulful journey. Although our material needs may be met, our spiritual needs are calling our attention. The Moon's later conjunction to fiery Mars may make us frustrated with what we’ve been given, but controlled and directed energy will bring better results than an outburst.","You're in a position to make an impact today -- one that can have positive and lasting results. You may be more willing than usual to sacrifice your personal desires or energy for the greater good, feeling called to give back to your community or a group that's important to you. When you give to others, you initiate a cycle of fortune; the places and people you invest time and energy into now will then be better prepared to succeed and give back to others in the future.","A personal misunderstanding could set you off today. If someone voices a misconception of you or what you’ve achieved in the past, do your best to control your reaction. You have the potential within you to react with grace and poise and you should feel no need to agree with the labels they’re trying to put on you. Prepare yourself mentally to stand on your own two feet and show who you are through your actions.","It can be especially difficult to focus today, so it will take extra effort on your part to make sure that you make it through your to-do list without missing anything. If you have someone else helping you with your tasks, you may want to keep track of what they’re doing. Miscommunicated instructions can cause you to have to go back and redo their work; it’s better to pay attention and get it right the first time rather than waste more time doing it twice.","Gossip is circulating, but your participation is a choice. Sometimes it’s impossible to avoid being in the presence of intriguing tales about the people you know. However, even if you didn’t mean to learn anything, it’s your responsibility to make sure that this information doesn’t spread from you once you’ve heard it. It's also possible you could witness an embarrassing moment for someone else, but don’t jump to conclusions or immediately tell your friends -- you wouldn't want the same done to you.","As much as you like to share your joys with others, you'd be wise not to divulge your plans right now. There is someone who has been paying attention to what you’ve achieved and they aren’t necessarily supportive of the strides you’ve taken. Sometimes we jinx ourselves by letting everyone know what we’re planning to do before we do it, because we open the door for criticism or comparison to enter. If you’re beginning something new, keep it confidential until it gets closer to fruition.","You thrive in service to others, but even you have your limits. There may be several people or situations begging for your attention today, however, you’re only able to be in one place at a time and they will have to realize that. Set your boundaries and make it clear what you are able to do for others. It’s better to let people know what to expect from you up front rather than making big promises that you aren’t able to keep.","You'll be faced with a choice today to either go the easy way or the right way. The easier path may be calling after all the hard work you’ve been putting into your life lately, but you will need to make the decision to show up for yourself and be strong. Although it feels like you’re getting away with something by cutting corners, in reality, you’re only cheating yourself out of a full and meaningful experience. If you’re going to do something, you owe it to yourself to do it right.","Your knowledge and intuition are battling for dominance as you try to make decisions right now, and it can be tricky to know which one is the right one to listen to -- fears can be mistaken for intuition and false beliefs can be mistaken for knowledge. Find a quiet spot where you can be in tune with yourself and mull over an important choice you have. Ground yourself and breathe through any worries, and once you’ve let the nervous energy leave your body, then decide.","You've been putting a lot of energy into making things happen in your life, but may not be seeing the results you'd expect. If it feels like you always take one step forward and two steps back, honestly ask yourself if you’ve really been going after what you want at full power, or if you’re actually moving hesitantly while believing that you’re protecting yourself. This division could be what’s creating the stagnancy in your life. If you can, changing up your surroundings can help you to jumpstart your initiative.","You’re not afraid to juggle a few different jobs or activities at once in order to accomplish the goals that you’re passionate about, but make sure that you’re creating a sound foundation for yourself. Moving money around or having a freeform approach to your schedule can be easy to lose track of, causing interruptions and slowing your progress. Instead, consolidating some of what’s going on in your life could create a more regular routine and allow you to focus more on what's important.","Emotions from the past threaten to hold you back from fully evolving into who you want to be... If you’ve been putting your passions on hold for a long time due to discouragement from family or a negative reaction from friends in the past, ask yourself why you’re avoiding your truth in order to squeeze into a box that you don’t fit in. Just like butterflies must escape their chrysalis in order to fly, you must leave the box that you’ve been put into.","What you really feel and what you say may not be in alignment today. Others could be pressuring you into an opinion of theirs that you don’t share, yet you feel forced to keep your mouth shut. You will have to pick and choose your battles in this situation, but know that the tactful and short response will help you to save your breath in a lose/lose debate. Remember that some people are only interested in hearing themselves talk."
2021-02-19,"A transformation is beginning, but it’s up to us to transform for the better. The sensitive Moon's trine to dark Pluto gets us in touch with our shadow selves and acknowledges our dual-sided natures. We can break down inner boundaries on a deep level, then when the Moon enters intellectual Gemini, we'll be able to consider our emotions with a more logical viewpoint. However, as receptive Venus squares off with assertive Mars at 6:04 pm EST, we may experience a battle of wills fueled by deep differences.","Your need for security is conflicting with your need to connect with others. Being hurt by someone in the past -- especially in situations that involved your money or self-esteem -- makes it difficult for you to open up to people and begin to trust again. What you feel and what you’re telling others may not be lining up, and they suspect that there’s something else going on when you say you’re fine. Be honest with them and allow yourself the time to understand your emotional boundaries.","There’s a fire burning within you, right when you want to show a relaxed and gentle image to the world. A stressful situation at work may require you keep a calm demeanor or you may have to hide your true frustration with someone’s ignorant comments. Try not to lose your temper, but allow yourself a release after this is over through something physical like exercise or dance. Your commitment to grace can impress people that matter, but they will likely be watching from afar.","Expect some delays today, because the better prepared you are, the easier they will be to bear. This could be a physical delay if you’re on the go, or if you’re learning, it may be difficult to focus on and retain the information that's presented to you. Stepping away to get some exercise or stretch your body will help you release the anxious or stuck energy. Reset your brain with physical movement and you will see the mental blocks begin to dissolve.","You could be very tempted to spend your hard-earned money today. It looks like other people might be pressuring you to spend more than you were expecting on entertainment or gifts, so you need to exercise restraint if you know that you need this money for something else. However, you may have enough squirreled away for an event like this. The events of today are highly influenced by your ability to manage your assets and know how much you have to share with others.","You may have to choose who to let down today... You have responsibilities that conflict with spending time with a close friend or loved one. Depending on your work situation, you may be able to put these obligations on hold in order to spend time with this person, but you may be required to work and ask them to wait. Whether you’re disappointing your boss or the person you care about, know that it was a choice you had to make and stand behind it.","You can make plans, but the universe has other ones in store. Your agenda won't likely play out the way you want it to today, but try not to react negatively to these subverted plans. Life is about adjusting to the reality that gets in the way of our ideals, but you can use this to your advantage. If you end up with extra free time, use it to do something else that you’ve been putting off rather than mourning what didn’t happen.",You’re at a crossroads right now and you’ll have to decide whether to follow the new and fun path that’s being presented to you or to go for the tried-and-true but more difficult path. One option will help you to open your mind and be more free and the other will help you to be more courageous and decisive. Both have their pros and cons so you will have to determine which one has fewer cons for you. Choose wisely!,"Vulnerability and bravery don’t have to be at odds, but it’s a very difficult tightrope to walk. You must protect your heart today without hurting someone else, and this is such a delicate balance. The feelings that arise are like when you receive a gift from someone you love that they are very excited about, but that disappoints you. React calmly and with gratitude to whatever comes your way, because jumping into a reaction can cause hurt feelings on both sides.","Swallowing your pride isn’t easy but it might be necessary now. You'll have to choose today between smiling through your teeth or sticking up for yourself, and what you decide will determine your emotional state for the rest of the day. The polite approach will be far less explosive, but if it hurts too badly to keep it inside, you can share the truth of how you’re feeling. Just try to do so without being aggressive, because the other person is more likely to hear you.","Changes have been happening to you within, helping you to identify ways in which you self-sabotage and revealing the importance of eliminating negative self-talk ... but this can be a daunting task. Sometimes it’s easier to make sacrifices when the aim is to create supportive situations for others instead of yourself. If you think of your future self as a friend that you can help out by choosing to take care of yourself today, you are more likely to create positive habits.","You could feel uncontrollably drawn to something today, but it's a person or situation that you were raised to avoid, so you would have to rebel against what you were taught in order to fulfill your desires. You may feel like you’re betraying your past self or your family in pursuing something different, but we are all constantly changing in life and we shed our old ideals as we grow. We can love the people who taught us without following their every rule.","Unexpectedly, someone may come to you for help or advice on an important matter today. It could be someone that is a stranger to you or someone who you are surprised needs help, but either way, they are unable to depend on self-sufficiency and are bringing their troubles to you. Help them if you are able to, but maintain boundaries if your intuition suggests you are being taken advantage of. Give, but only do what makes you feel safe."
2021-02-20,"A fog is finally lifting for all of us. The intuitive Moon is traveling through inquisitive Gemini and will form harmonious trines to critical Saturn, clever Mercury, and philosophical Jupiter throughout the day. We are beginning to grow in emotional discipline, understanding, and acceptance that will help us to make better choices for ourselves and each other. At 7:52 pm EST, Mercury finally turns direct in Aquarius, beginning the process of eliminating miscommunications and correcting our technology issues. This moment marks a return to clarity.","The support you have needed is finally coming through. You may have been trudging through life lately while isolated or in conflict with someone, but today, a group of close friends or coworkers may provide you with uplifting words and encouraging energy that gets you back into the groove. The stuck feelings and the uncertainty that have been holding you back are beginning to melt away and you are ready to let your refreshed confidence spread this positive feeling to others.","Although your efforts to boost your net worth may have been thrown off course or blocked in the past, any energy that you put into your career now will reward you sooner rather than later. You are especially motivated to provide for yourself and your loved ones -- if you put action behind this, opportunities that you wouldn’t normally receive will come to you. Don't wait around for good fortune to stumble your way, go out and make it happen.","Your mind is working quickly today but it's colored by your emotions. Don’t jump to any conclusions or react hastily, because you are being influenced by your personal feelings and it might be too difficult to see what’s really going on. You may feel tempted to take out a small form of revenge on someone, but instead, choose peace and spend some time in meditation or simply taking deep breaths. Sleep on it, and you will see that retaliation was not the answer.","Trust how you feel, because it will get you much further than talking yourself out of what you’re sensing. Your intuition is leading you toward a better spiritual path and, although you feel uncertain of where you’re going, you know that this is worth trying. Move in silence for now and allow others to wonder what it is that you’re doing when it comes to both spiritual and financial pursuits -- your ability to keep a secret and follow your gut instinct can lead you to a valuable gift.","New connections are coming to bring the best out of you. You may have felt lost when it comes to making new friends or finding a romantic companion, but friendship will come more easily under the current planetary influences, even if it was nowhere to be found before. You have to be a friend to make a friend, so listen to others and show genuine interest in what they have to say -- this will help you to bond with and understand people more deeply.","If you’re on the right track, you will know it. Whatever you’re feeling emotionally about your career and your public image will come to light today. If you notice that your workload is quite heavy and draining these days, ask yourself if this role is worth what it is costing you. If you can't find a way to take some of the pressure off yourself and create a more sustainable relationship with your workplace, it may be time to move on.","You’re in a position to share your wisdom with others today. You may find that younger or more inexperienced people than you are asking you for guidance, but you’re not sure what to say to them in order to encourage them. Speak truthfully and from experience rather than depending on what you’ve been told by others. Don’t worry about messing up and saying the wrong thing, because as long as you are kind in your delivery, they are sure to appreciate your mentorship.","It’s time to calm down the chaos in your home. Family members or roommates may have been driving you crazy with miscommunications or accidents as of late, and you’re ready for peace and quiet to take over. Opportunities for relaxation are on the way for you, so enjoy the silence and rest rather than filling your time with more activities. This could also be a call to reorganize your home and redraw your boundaries -- set the scene for harmony and healing to flow back into your life.","Expressing yourself has been no small feat lately, but you’re finally getting back your voice. If the right words have been eluding you as you’ve tried to tell someone how you feel, you’ll start to notice these words coming back into your mental grasp now -- you’ll be able to think of something to say during the conversation, rather than realizing what you should have said later while you’re in the shower. Enjoy this sharpening of the mind as it encourages you to connect with your loved ones.","It’s time to put a grand plan into action, and your plans are only supported by your natural consistency. If you’re not serious about a big project that you’ve been talking about doing, then it will eventually fade from your focus and become another project that never got off of the ground. If you haven’t yet, commit to taking small steps daily toward what you want to see manifest in your life. If you’ve been truly persevering already, you will see rewards today.","You may have been struggling with feeling lost and separated from your inner self as of late, but starting today, you begin making your way back to personal truth. It's time to take back your power from others who may have manipulated you into giving it up to them. Take the initiative to do something for yourself without consulting anyone else -- your zest for life will begin to return in kind, and you’ll enjoy feeling like yourself again.","Your soul's journey feels like it’s splitting off into multiple paths, but wishy-washiness is preventing you from moving forward on any of them. You’ll continue in this uncertainty as long as you’re living in the past. Former experiences are creating doubt in your mind when it comes to trusting your intuition to move forward, but let the past be the past. Setting yourself free from fear and grudges will open up your heart to safe and fresh experiences."
2021-02-21,"Emotional sensitivity and strength are companions, not opposites, and we'll need to use both today. The Moon's square to confusing Neptune can cause us to follow someone down the wrong path out of fear or misinformation, however, her later trine to harmonious Venus will help us to realign our beliefs and ideals with the reality of who we are. Once the Moon enters its home sign of Cancer at 10:53 pm EST, the restlessness and disorientation will begin to fade from our minds as peace takes its place.","It’s hard to keep your feelings to yourself as fears or old, bad habits emerge, trying to pull you back into your past. You will need to maintain presence of mind in order to keep from backsliding into situations you have left behind. Your duty is to respect yourself and protect your progress, so avoid getting sucked into arguments or negative indulgences and you’ll feel proud of your commitment to bettering yourself. If you can, spend some time talking to a friend who supports your growth.","Peer pressure can be hard to resist, but it won't take you where you need to go. Remember who you are and trust your instincts when it comes to what is and isn't right for you. Although there are people in your life who do support you, something being presented to you now is not in alignment with your path, and you will feel it deep inside. Here, the bravest thing you can do is pursue the dream of your heart rather than follow in the footsteps of others.","Even though you've grown and changed a lot over time, people in your midst are bringing up your past interests and ideals today. They're not necessarily doing this to humble you, but in some way, they are causing you to doubt the ways in which you've changed, or even that you've changed at all. Instead of slipping into negative self-talk, encourage yourself to continue on a brighter path. Don't allow your past to get in the way of your future.","There is some truth that you're trying to keep from looking at, but your rose-colored glasses are preventing you from understanding it for what it is. If you're rationalizing your way into hesitation or procrastination, understand that you'll have to face the music eventually. There's nothing more useful than real awareness and you know this. Embrace the good, the bad, and the ugly and see your situation for what it is so that you can respond accordingly.","Your relationship with trust will be brought into focus today. This does not necessarily mean someone will betray you, but you can expect to hear stories of betrayal or unbalanced power dynamics from the people you encounter. Learn from these stories and remember how they make you feel. Be a trustworthy person and don't put your trust into people who have shown you that they aren't willing to be there for you -- cultivate the relationships that will feed back into your life with joy and positivity.","Emotional security will overcome any doubts that crop up at work today, as long as you're willing to back yourself. If you have a habit of internally telling yourself that you're not good enough, you may end up letting someone in the workplace dismiss you without even giving you a chance. You will need to advocate for yourself to a superior or coworker, even if it feels unfamiliar. Let your skills and your previous work speak for themselves without trying to minimize your accomplishments.","There is a mental fog hovering over your to-do list and unexciting responsibilities are likely to slip your mind if you're not paying attention. Although there are fun opportunities and people begging you to come out and play, you’ll need to be determined to get your work done before you zone out on entertainment. If you procrastinate what you could be doing early on, then you’ll be frustrated later. Be a friend to your future self and buckle down.","Emotions may get in the way of the truth today as dramatic, creative energies clash with logic and reality. You may remember a situation happening one way while someone else remembers it another way, and you are uncertain how to reconcile these two versions of the same shared experience. Your best approach in this case is to be forgiving and simply agree to disagree. If this is a repeat issue, though, consider where these exaggerations are stemming from emotionally.","You may be replaying something over and over in your head today, but you’re unable to let it go because of the way it made you feel. However, you’re also afraid to talk about it and get your feelings out in the open. While it can be easier to pretend things aren’t bothering you, it will be harder in the long run when you’re trying to open up again. Holding everything inside will magnify the situation but talking things out will lighten your load.","You'll be presented with a situation today in which you need to ask someone for help or find instructions, although you may tempted to brave it on your own and tap no one for assistance. While self-sufficiency is exactly what's required at times, you’ll find that two heads are better than one for this project and you deserve to be supported. Including someone else's skills and effort will make you move along much faster than you would alone.","Your confidence may be wavering now, even as others are outwardly appreciating what you bring to the table. The more self-assured you are, though, the better things will go when you try to present yourself and your ideas. Life can feel more like an audition under the current planetary influences and imposter syndrome will pull you back if you don’t know your worth. Remember how capable you are, trust the research and time you’ve put in, and breathe a sigh of relief.","Your loved ones are trying to connect with you but you’re finding it hard to connect back. It may feel like they’re trying to relate to someone you no longer are, and you’re worried that they don’t see you or appreciate you for who you've become. It is sobering to realize that there’s no way to share every facet of yourself with someone else and that they can’t share all of their life with you, either. Try to love each other in the moment without needing every single detail."
2021-02-22,"Living with others in harmony feels like a breeze today as the universe is supporting emotional freedom and goodwill. The luminaries are getting along swimmingly, with the gentle Moon in nurturing Cancer forming an easy trine to the confident Sun at 6:47 am EST. Our outer selves and inner selves are connected now and sharing our emotions is easier than normal. When the Moon moves into a sextile with changeable Uranus, we see welcome financial changes flowing in and the whole world breathing a sigh of relief.","Insecurities are finally beginning to fade away... Any grudges you've held against family members or people you live with no longer feel so pressing, and self-esteem issues you developed from past painful experiences are starting to lose their sting. You have a chance to find emotional closure now, so if there is something you’ve been wanting to put to rest, write it on a piece of paper and then burn it. Step forward into the future free of these burdens and you’ll feel the load lifting off of you.","Conversations with friends and other supporters can bring you the confidence boost you need right now. If you’re grappling with personal insecurities or doubt, seek wisdom from the people who have always been there for you and reminisce about times when you overcame the odds. The better you understand yourself and your ability to shine even when you’re unsure, the better you will be able to navigate the confusing areas of life and carry yourself with pride.","Light is shining on your career world today and your creativity will bring good fortune to you. There's a good chance you'll hit upon an idea like a bolt of lightning -- a eureka moment that dissolves the roadblocks in your way. This is especially useful if you own your own business or have a side hustle, because this new concept can bring in money faster than you were expecting. If you work for someone else, this idea could bring favor from a superior that carries you far.","What you believe mentally and what you feel emotionally are in harmony, and this synchronicity opens up the floodgates to bring you good luck. While some Cancers will enjoy meeting a new friend or even a group of friends, others will simply receive the power of good fortune and positive situations that work out in your favor. It’s a good time to initiate a risky conversation or to ask for a raise, especially if you’re able to do so with humility and authenticity.","Forgotten savings or investments are returning to bring a smile to your face. While this may be cash that you find in an old wallet or a bill that ends up being refunded to you, money is returning to you when you thought it was lost. Work will have a lighter feeling as well and people will be acting more generous than normal, especially with you! Do what you have to do today to the best of your abilities, because you’re bound to see a return on investment.","People are willing to help you today, so put your best foot forward. Friends, coworkers, and loved ones are coming together to help you, even if it means they have to put aside some differences to do so. You may have been trying to do something all on your own, but it's just more than one person can handle. It's possible to ask for help while still taking responsibility and pulling your weight. Let your friends know if you need them.","You are blessed with productivity today and can make the most of it by devoting quality focus and care to your career or hobbies. Other people will be happy to support you in your financial efforts, so don't be shy about accepting a helping hand. You may receive a surprise surplus of money in the form of a gift or a refund which will come as a relief and motivate you to tap more of this fortunate energy.","A fresh wave of inspiration and awareness can put an end to a period of stagnancy. It is easier to self-motivate when you know what you want out of life, and right now, you're being drawn toward things that make you truly feel alive -- anything less will not make the cut. Take a risk on your creative ideas and dreams, because being true to yourself and embracing your uniqueness will serve you better than trying to blend into the crowd today.","You may need to step away for a break from your everyday grind. You're no stranger to hard work, but you could be on the verge of burnout if you're pushing past your limits every single day. Rest is necessary to perform your best and it's worth it to take care of your health now instead of waiting until you're under the weather. Instead of worrying about what you're missing out on, allow yourself to slow down without feeling guilty about it. Consider it an investment in your health.","A new discovery will keep you entertained and inspired today. This could be an artist that you suddenly discover or a movie that you see for the first time, and yet, it feels like it fits perfectly in your life and you’re wondering where it’s been all this time. In more intense cases, you could meet someone new who sparks this feeling in you, whether they’re a romantic pursuit or a new friend. Enjoy this freshness because it doesn’t come around every day!","Today's discipline will pay off in big dividends, so this is no time to slow down. Your career is feeling lighter and more rewarding, making this a good time to redouble your efforts in a side hustle of yours to bring in better revenue. If you’re already at capacity when it comes to balancing work and play in your schedule, then this may not be possible -- just know that the more effort you put in now, the more rewards you’ll see later.","People are paying attention to you now, so make sure you’re representing yourself well. You may feel tempted to exaggerate how you feel or to make wild some claims, so you’ll need to rein in the hyperbole if you actually want to get your point across. However, your sense of humor and fun stories will brighten the moods of others and you can expect to impress them with your charm. Being a source of joy for others will bring joy back to you."
2021-02-23,"We're stuck in a tug-of-war today between ambition and expectation. Initially, the Moon's trine to idealistic Neptune creates a desire to escape into a more beautiful world and her sextile to passionate Mars gives us the strength to power past obstacles. The challenge comes when the Moon opposes forceful Pluto and a surprise requires that we let go of perfection if we want to pursue our dreams. We can't control every aspect of our journey, but we can control how we respond to the ups and downs.","Something or someone may enter your life today and cause you to feel unsure of what you’ve been working toward for a while, but it’s time to show strength. A powerful force is shaking up your public image or your professional world and you can channel this energy in positive ways by separating your feelings from how others may perceive you. Show everyone that you are secure in who you are but still humble enough to admit when you’re wrong.","Expectations lead to disappointment when someone is not be able to live up to your mental picture of them. You are likely projecting your own values or desires onto others right now, so when they say something that doesn’t align with this projection, it can be disillusioning. It's important you are able to live and let live -- someone may shock you with their opinion, especially if it goes against your deeply held morals, but your reaction speaks to your character, so act with kindness.","Paying attention to your subconscious will help you to be more present and aware when you’re conscious. Consider starting a dream diary today to record and analyze what the symbolism in your dreams may be trying to tell you. In your waking life, your intuition could be alerting you to a deep passion that you haven’t yet explored, and it may be something that you never saw yourself doing before. Your willpower is strong, you only need to find a concrete direction to point yourself in.","You can trust your body to be honest with you even when your mind is uncertain. Listen to what your gut is trying to tell you and feel the emotions that you’re feeling without judgment. If you sense something is off within an important relationship, don’t simply gloss over this feeling in order to move on with what you were doing. Yoga or meditation can help you get more in tune with your body and this physical intuition -- let it lead you to what you’re looking for.","A recent change in routine is throwing you off your groove and you may need to spend some time alone figuring out how to reorganize your life to give yourself the balance you need. There are things that you know need to be completed, but you’re procrastinating or over-thinking and this is hindering you from making forward progress. Once you commit to a routine that works for the new circumstances in your life, you’ll be on the road to success.","You’re craving something fun now and may need to step outside your comfort zone to find it. Try something simple like a new recipe or a craft -- anything that activates your sense of curiosity and creativity. It may be difficult to get someone to participate with you, and even if someone is there, they may not be interested in what’s calling to you. It’s just fine to experience things on your own; you’re growing as a person when you choose what you really want.","You may feel a strong urge to change things up in your workplace or your home, but will be met with resistance. There are people who want things to stay the way they are and stand against making any updates. Try to encourage them to compromise and to give your ideas a chance -- if they don’t work out, so be it, but you deserve to have some say in the place that you spend so much of your time.","It’s important to hear both sides of a story before you jump to conclusions. If someone tells you something shocking about a person you know, don’t be too quick to believe it, especially if it sounds out of character for the other person. It’s easy to get carried away with your imagination and begin to change your perception of people based on the stories you hear about them, but don’t take gossip as fact. Stay neutral and make a note to not tell this person your business.","Temptations abound right now so you’ll need a strong backbone if you aim to resist what they’re offering. Are you sticking with the resolutions that you made at the beginning of the year, or are you beginning to let routines or budgets slip? It can be difficult to focus on changing your mindset when stress and surprise issues keep popping up to thwart your best plans, but keep up the discipline -- don’t let yourself backslide into the person you were in the past.","Revelations about your relationships with others and your inner self may lead you to wonder if you need to change course. Are you living out your own dreams, or are you living out the dream of someone else to keep your relationship pleasant? Sometimes it’s hard to differentiate between our own goals and the deeply held goals of others, especially parents and partners. This may not be a life-changing course correction, but you’ll feel more like yourself once you make it and live it out in the open.","Practice makes perfect, which means you can’t expect to be perfect the first time you try something. Perfectionism may cause you to give up on new activities and hobbies if you’re not good at them right away, but by giving in to this urge, you’re robbing yourself of a beneficial learning experience. Something led you to this new activity you are currently approaching and you owe it to yourself to work at it until you receive fulfilling results.","Be assertive with the people in your life now, because being a yes-person will only lead to a loss of self. You may be on the receiving end of peer pressure and will need to either stand your ground or be willing to try something new. Whatever you decide, don’t let yourself be overshadowed in the decision-making process, especially if the peer pressure is forcing you to do something alone. Trust yourself, and if a situation feels wrong for you, there’s no need to prove anything to anyone."
2021-02-24,"There's nowhere to hide our true feelings today as the gentle Moon enters dramatic Leo, giving us opportunities to outwardly express our emotions. Courageous Mars' trine to transformational Pluto then drives us to act with courage and leave behind situations that are stunting our growth. Comfortable doesn't equal good, and this idea is reinforced when the Moon opposes critical Saturn. Those who haven't acted honorably will feel that they have cheated themselves, so we should hold our heads high and act with integrity when difficult situations arise.","Your financial situation is at the forefront now and you will be expected to work hard to achieve your latest goals. Although you are willing to take risks when it comes to money-making opportunities, don’t go for anything that sounds too good to be true. There’s no need to speed through the details or cut corners, so keep a reasonable pace and let the boosted stamina and confidence that you’re feeling carry you into a steady growth of abundance.","Your impulsivity and optimism could cause you to get a reaction that you weren’t looking for. You may not even be aware of it, but the universe is instilling a confidence in you right now that causes you to think that you can’t fail. However, if you’re saying things recklessly, you might let something slip that you were trying to keep a secret. Sometimes we jinx things by telling people about them before they happen, so keep big plans to yourself until you see them coming to fruition.","The deeper side of your life is coming to the surface and you are ready to accept all facets of yourself. Everything that you’ve been through has led you to be who you are now, and it’s worth it to spend time understanding who you are and not charge forward into life aimlessly. Hidden dreams, fears, and memories are emerging in order to draw your attention toward your emotional life and remind you to find healing and acceptance within.","A balance of power in a key relationship in your life will make itself known, if it hasn’t already -- this could be a romantic relationship, a business partnership, a best friend, or a worst enemy. The control and freedoms that you each have become obvious today, and you will need to be honest with yourself in order to keep moving forward. Be wary of getting obsessed with people that you love or of getting revenge against a nemesis; it’s healthier to let go than to hold on too tightly.","Career change is on the horizon and it appears to be better suited to what you need out of life. If you’re noticing power struggles, stubborn coworkers, and haphazard routines are causing you strife in the workplace, it’s time to start looking for another job. The current astrological energy will reveal how aligned you are with your workplace -- a career that’s not right for you will be noticeably frustrating today, even if it's not typically difficult. Use this powerful, transformational energy to break new ground.","Your adrenaline is pumping today and an adventure might do you some good. Step out of your usual setting and expand your mind in order to make the most of this time. Studying spiritual matters and supernatural phenomena could be fulfilling and exciting for you or playing sports that really get your heart rate up. Instead of devoting all your energy to work matters today, make it your priority to nourish your body and soul with excitement.","Your comfort zone gets rattled today so you’ll need to put in extra effort to keep it feeling comfortable. There may be something simple like a mess in your home, or something deeper like you allowing people to treat you unkindly in your own space. You have to be the force for change in your life today, so focus on beautifying your space and enforcing your boundaries. You can expect some pushback on this, but stand firm and look at it as being an advocate for yourself.","Your mind is able to handle a lot today, but there are still enough distractions to drive you away from your goals if you’re not careful. People may be bringing issues to you to fix or simply creating situations that cause you to lose track of your responsibilities. Set boundaries and let them know that, while you understand their needs, you have your own needs to attend to as well, and you’ll be able to help them or give them your attention afterward.","The extra energy that you’ve put into your goals is paying off, but physically, you are probably feeling drained. You know what sacrifices must be made in order to bring about the future that you’re creating for yourself, but you need to incorporate investments into your health so that you can enjoy this future when you get there. Be honest about how well you’ve been taking care of yourself, then make the necessary changes to improve your physical wellness. Remember, your body is your forever home.","You receive a burst of energy today that heightens your senses and fills you with drive. This restlessness needs an outlet, so you could direct some of your passion toward a physical activity or a love interest, or you may pick up an old project and have it finished much faster than you expected. Just don’t leave others in the dust with your frantic pace and hyper energy -- allow them to catch up so you can work together.","The past is coming back to remind you of what used to be, but this doesn’t mean that you are headed back there. It’s time to find closure on negative situations and let go of grudges that bother you more than they bother the people that you’re holding them against. What’s familiar is not necessarily what’s good for you, and you’re aware of this. Now is a good time to let go of both physical and emotional clutter, because you need to make space for new blessings to arrive.","Scattering your focus or hesitating to express yourself will cause you to miss out on the networking opportunities that you’re receiving, so sharpen up before you head into your day. You’re bolder now when it comes to sharing your ideas on how to improve the world around you, and others are hearing what you have to say with intrigue and agreement. The more courageous and forward-thinking you can be with your ideas and opinions, without being offensive, the better."
2021-02-25,"Innovative energy and spiritual harmony allow us to take our soul’s desires and run with them. Beautiful Venus enters Pisces at 8:11 am EST, creating a gentle and enchanting atmosphere for love and friendship. While the emotional Moon's opposition to abundant Jupiter can cause us to overindulge, a healthy sense of moderation will keep our vices from taking over the day. Finally, the courageous Sun's sextile to stand-out Uranus brings a newfound confidence in our unique gifts and the inspiration that we need to keep going.","A sense of camaraderie fills your day, but you owe it to yourself to be in a zen and healthy place before you jump into your plans. This is a time to prioritize your spiritual life and get in tune with the inner you. Beware that you may feel the urge to impulsively spend on entertainment and treats today, but others are also feeling generous with both gifts and kind words -- you're likely to receive a positive surprise that will fulfill your need for good news.","Balancing work and home life isn't always easy, and any imbalance will make itself known to you eventually. Overworking will result in exhaustion and frustration, whereas too much time at home will exacerbate boredom and overthinking. Expect one or the other to try to command your attention today, but don't give in -- maintain your stability. Your friends are your greatest source of support now and their encouragement will be invaluable, so give them an opportunity to help you be strong.","Your career is coming into focus, but your mental focus is scattered. An opportunity for advancement or a position that's better suited to you is soon to arrive, but if you're not in the right frame of mind to receive it, you could miss it. The opportunities that you've been hoping and asking for may not fit into your life until you change or improve your skill set, so eliminate distractions today and start taking yourself to the next level.","New people are coming into your life, but you may still be feeling the sting from a past friendship that ended. You could be experiencing power struggles or financial issues that stem from people in the past overstepping or creating insecurity for you. Now, though, you know to set firm boundaries in order to help prevent this from occurring again, so remember your worth and don't talk yourself out of a quality friendship just because you received less than what you deserved from somebody else.","Advice and opposition are arriving hand in hand, but it can be hard to tell the difference between who means you well and who means you harm. Keep your big plans or dreams to yourself for now, as jealous enemies or fearful lovers can throw you off track. Knowing when not to show your hand is an asset, and you have such a good hand to play. Once you begin to see real progress being made, other people's opinions won't stand in the way.","You could be thrown by someone else's elusive actions, so you'll need to cultivate inner peace in order to stay on course. Someone that you’re desperate for an answer from is evading your messages and the confirmation that you need to move forward is nowhere to be found. Don’t let impatience get the best of you; remember that there’s only so much you can control on your own. This situation demands calm endurance and it’s worth it to be practiced in perseverance.","Needing to control everything today will lead to drama, but an ability to compromise will save you from getting a headache. There’s likely a situation or project that you’re working on tirelessly and you’re committed to making sure that everything runs smoothly. You want to make sure that it will be flawless, but a last second change of schedule or an unreliable helper may throw a wrench into your best laid plans. Be flexible and graceful under pressure and you will still deliver a satisfying result, despite the roadblocks.","A new and exciting person may have recently entered your life, but you will have to fit them in with the needs of your loved ones. You likely have something fun planned today that you’ve been looking forward to, but be aware you have a tendency to go overboard in spending time with one person right now rather than balancing the relationships in your life. While this person can be shiny and alluring, make sure that you’re not leaving those who have been around the longest in the dust.","Eyes are on you today. People are paying attention to see how you will respond to an opportunity or a new load of responsibilities, and it's likely something that is unfamiliar to you. Be honest with what you can provide and don’t promise more than you can deliver, because it will end up overwhelming you if you do. A little less conversation and a little more action will benefit you more than you can imagine, because people are looking for real results and not flowery words.","You could run into an old companion around town today and it might be awkward to see this person after so long. Perhaps there is something that you’ve always wanted to say to them or a burning question you’ve been waiting to ask. Although this is not an ideal time to get back together with a friend or lover from your past, it’s okay to be honest and say what’s in your heart to find the peace that you’re looking for.","Newfound optimism and financial improvements are boosting your position in life, but self-sabotage and emotional turbulence may threaten this feeling of security. You’re seeing blessings flow in from left and right, so what will you do to keep them? You’re better able to commit to others than usual now, but make an effort to commit to yourself as well. It’s worthwhile to realize that the fear of failure is self-fulfilling if it keeps you from running toward your end goal.","Although your peers find you to be composed and educated in the ideas that you’re presenting to them, secretly, you’re not sure if you know what you’re doing. From the outside, it looks like you have it all together, but on the inside, you’re working hard to make sure that you’re not letting anybody down. Take a break from measuring yourself up against people who have been in their career longer than you have or people who had more of a head start. Comparison is the thief of joy."
2021-02-26,"Feminine energy and masculine energy clash with our emotional centers as we try to determine the best course of action. The heart-focused Moon's square to self-focused Mars tempts us toward selfish or impulsive actions. Once the Moon enters analytical Virgo at 12:07 pm, we are forced look at who we are rather than how we imagine ourselves. Although Luna's opposition to prideful Venus may make us dig in our heels to avoid looking in the mirror, we grow when we honestly acknowledge both our light and our shadow.",A quest to fill an emotional void may be sabotaging your growth and it’s tempting to buy junk food and entertainment in order to keep up your enthusiasm. You or someone else is providing things that you crave but don’t really need in an attempt to keep you from looking at the big picture. Are these distractions preventing you from doing the emotional work that you need to be doing in order to grow? Cut the noise and prioritize a healthy lifestyle to get in tune with your real needs.,"Your frustration is heightened today so don’t jump to conclusions about anyone, because people may be accidentally pushing your buttons rather than irritating you on purpose. Holding back is a better option, because when you start pointing fingers, it’s likely that you will find a few pointing right back at you. If someone is truly antagonizing you, it’s best to speak with them privately rather than blowing up in front of a group. Find out what their motivation is and protect your peace.","Doubt may creep in when an unexpected event at work causes you to rethink your choices. Sometimes we’re in the wrong place for us, but sometimes a difficult day is simply a difficult day. Try to be understanding when people who are dealing with their own problems and doubts are projecting onto you, but also, set your boundaries and know when to remove yourself from a situation that’s causing you too much stress. Know that you don’t have to absorb the tension of others for their comfort.","Everyone has an opinion on everything, but the opinions that others have about you are out of your control. Someone will likely bring a concern about your lifestyle or your personal expression to you, but this concern is none of their business. The limiting beliefs and narrow-minded insistence of others will stand between you and emotional security if you allow it. You deserve to learn how to love your inner self without the negative input of others.","It’s easy to let competition turn into a rivalry today, and this rivalry may quickly breed jealousy and pettiness. Your competitor could even be someone that you considered your friend or mentor who is now trying to one-up you and prove their superiority. The only attitude to have in these situations is one of acceptance, forgiveness, and a gentle detachment from their views. Whether you find that you win or lose, you can hold your head high with grace and self-assuredness that you were a worthy competitor.","You have loving people in your life, but their thoughts and words must be heard in order to keep them around. It’s easy to get overly focused on your own worries or goals, expecting friends or loved ones to hang around until you get everything together, but their patience may be running thin. The situation may also be reversed, where you are putting your life on hold in order to wait for someone to show you that they really care. A little appreciation will go a long way now.","It may be difficult to determine where you stand with others, so you'll have to be discerning in order to find your people. Be more selective with who you give yourself to, body and soul, because while it may sound old-fashioned, you are a treasure and there are some who don’t respect what’s truly valuable. Opt out of responding to people who needle you into frustration or cover over their insults with thinly-veiled jokes. Trust your intuition and pull back today if needed.","You may be stuck in a rut due to a rejection or a lack of direction, continuously pondering over your emotions about the situation without mentally moving on. You deserve to let yourself out of this cage of overthinking and understand that any doors that closed on you were a protection from someone or something that you were not meant for. There are so many options still out there for you, but not while you’re waiting around looking at what didn’t work out -- turn your focus to the future.","A wrench gets thrown in your routine today and there may be a mess to clean up before the day is over. Whether this is a literal mess or a figurative one, don’t allow yourself to get caught up in frustration or self-pity. Take back control by jumping in and doing what you can to salvage the situation. This will take effort on your part, but you know how to put in the hard work when others aren’t willing to.","Someone is trying to communicate with you, but you aren't quite sure what to say back. They are looking for a specific answer from you yet are unwilling to disclose what that answer is. It's difficult to operate with secretive people when you’re wanting a straightforward conversation, but oftentimes these people are reserved because they’ve been hurt in the past. It’s okay to need more open conversation, and even if they can’t provide it, let them know you can’t read their mind.","There’s tension in your home today, triggering the careful balance between compromise and holding boundaries. Your family or roommates are trying to influence your decisions in one direction, but they’re not doing it in a way that makes you want to change your mind. Even if they’re resorting to the low road, take the high road and let them know if they’re pushing you too far. It’s okay to stand your ground in a debate, especially if it’s about your future.","Someone who wronged you may still be going on like nothing happened, and now, you’re not sure how to bring it up to them or if you even should. Passive aggression will not come to any kind of positive result. You’re allowed to speak clearly and confidently about how you feel, and if they respond in a way that dismisses or belittles you, there’s no need to continue allowing them so much reign over your feelings. Pour your positive energy into those who will reciprocate."
2021-02-27,"It’s time to separate fact from fiction, lest our fears take over. The ever-changing Moon's trine to rebellious Uranus can help us make changes that last inwardly, but we still must steer ourselves toward positive character development. The Full Moon in Virgo at 3:17 am EST supports this quest and shows us what has broken down in our life to make space for a better self. Our fears can keep us from moving forward as the Moon opposes uncertain Neptune, but if the old way is unsatisfactory, change is inevitable.","Simply waiting for the winds to blow you to where you’re supposed to be will not take you to your destination -- instead, an inner change must be made, and with purpose. Your sense of security has been shaken, either emotionally or financially, and your fears want you to run away instead of reaching up toward a better life. Rather than sabotaging the opportunities the universe is handing you, grab hold of them and commit to routinely building yourself up until your confidence returns.","Situations that were once so familiar and inviting now feel foreign and uncomfortable. This is a sign that you are outgrowing your old life and the changes that you have made in order to cultivate your new life are having a ripple effect. If the urge to regress into your old self hits, remind yourself that by making choices that lead to the life you really want, you’re getting closer to who you are, not further away. We all start out somewhere, but we don’t have to end up there.","Emotions are running high today as the ways in which you’ve sacrificed for your family and your career begin to come to fruition. This is the big push, where you’re jumping over the final hurdle in order to reach the next step in your career or the new home you'll be living in. Channel any intense feelings into exercise or creative works so that you'll be able to enjoy the fruits of all your labor without restlessness.","Someone who hurt you in the past may come back to try to retrieve your favor. There are people who are no longer in your life because you were no longer tolerating disrespect. They’re now on the outside looking in, claiming to be different people, but this doesn’t mean you have to let them back into your life. Say what you feel and trust that the future holds a better support group for you -- there’s no use holding yourself back for people who weren't there for you.","Financially, things are looking up, but emotionally, prepare for a hazy ride. You’ve been working hard to say no to temptation and money is flowing to you, but daydreams or obsessions could get in the way of your progress. You may suddenly start thinking about an old flame or an exciting new person in your life and spend hours lost in thought as the day passes. There’s only so much time in the day, though -- it’s okay to have your head in the clouds sometimes, but don’t get stuck there.","You have a tendency to lose yourself in other people today, but knowing your sense of self is one of your greatest assets and will serve you well. Once we start comparing ourselves to others or copying them in order to get what they have, we start to change our personal expression out of a place of envy. While there’s nothing wrong with being inspired by someone you admire, make sure that you’re doing it from a place of authenticity and adding your own unique style.","Your vivid dreams and heightened intuition will show you what you haven’t been paying enough attention to. Write down your dreams and see if you can interpret what your subconscious is trying to show you. You may come to realize you've been ignoring red flags with a friend or partner or avoiding important paperwork, and now is the time to eliminate these destructive actions and procrastinate no longer. Whatever you’re not willing to admit to yourself will be revealed today, and you will be better off for looking at it.","The feelings of a friend will be revealed to you, and how you react makes a difference in the outcome. When someone close to you approaches you with a confession or a secret, handle it gently. The information could be unsettling or it could be exciting, but it will certainly be unexpected. Acknowledge the bravery that it took for them to tell you this and try not to react with shock if it’s not something you wanted to hear. Kindness matters.","People are especially focused on you today and what you’ve been up to lately is at the center of attention. There’s nowhere for you to hide, so you might as well enjoy the spotlight. If you’ve been putting in the hours and working hard, you’re likely to receive some recognition for this from superiors. However, if you’ve been running away from your responsibilities, they may be back to haunt you. The best news is that if you are looking for a new career, it’s closer than ever!","The energy today feels much like being at the precipice of a great mountain, and you’re standing so close to the top. Don’t let the fears of others hold you back from a learning opportunity that will help you to achieve your dreams. There is someone in your midst who’s putting negative thoughts in your head, but not because they’re trying to hurt you, it's quite the opposite -- they’re trying to protect you, but let their fears pass by you without attaching to them.","Transformation is in the air, pulling away something you are tightly holding on to. You’re learning that nothing lasts forever, but that’s because we’re always meant to be growing and changing rather than stagnating as the person we were years ago. Letting go of past places that felt like home and people you saw every day is a natural part of life, and it’s okay to grieve them as they go. Once you’ve said goodbye, fill the space with something that will nourish your mind and soul.","Confusing situations between you and another person arise, but this is because there’s something you need to talk about. It’s likely that you’re hesitant about speaking up, but if you think you might regret not saying it, then say it. It's speak now or forever hold your peace, so you will want to be honest with the people around you rather than hide your feelings. Without blowing things out of proportion, say what’s on your mind and stand by it."
2021-02-28,"The darker, edgier side of life is appealing today, intriguing us and revealing what we never knew was beneath the surface. The emotional Moon's trine to investigative Pluto inspires us to unearth the hidden side of ourselves -- everything that people don’t often talk about. The Moon then trines brave Mars, giving us the will to stand up for what we feel and believe in. Once the Moon enters harmonious Libra at 2:17 pm EST, our convictions begin to soften and we’ll be more willing to compromise.","Good news may come to you on the professional front today, rewarding all that you’ve been working toward. Perhaps your boss has finally filled a position that will take some responsibilities off you, or you might take the next step in growing your own business. This new flow of income and support from other people can help you in ways you weren’t expecting, as long as you are willing to put in the work and sacrifice on your end.","A new sense of lightheartedness is beginning to wash over you as an old fear that was holding you back is being left behind. You’ll hardly even notice that it’s gone -- sometime you’ll look back and see what it was that you did for the last time, without even knowing that it would be the last time. If an opportunity to conquer your fear of failure or embarrassment arises, allow yourself to simply have fun and be free.","Emotional energy is charged throughout the day, illuminating your power dynamics with others and asking you to be honest about how they make you feel. Giving permissions to certain special people that you wouldn’t give to others is common, but this is a slippery slope if they are now taking advantage. Acknowledge your feelings and feel them all the way through without trying to rationalize them away. Your emotions are there to guide you, and when you’re in tune with yourself, you make better choices.","The biggest tasks of the day seem daunting, but your loved ones are helping to charge you up with enough confidence and energy to take on the world. With everyone around you letting you know you can handle it, you have what you need to conquer your day with gusto. Working in the background or trying to be humble and let someone else go ahead of you is not what you’re meant to be doing now. Rise up to the challenge and make the people who are cheering you on proud.","By showing initiative, you will open doors for yourself that were formerly closed, bringing you to your spot at the table with the people you admire. Your actions now can change the minds of people who may have dismissed you before and impress them, even if their first impression of you wasn’t so favorable. You’re no stranger to bold leadership and your ability to rally people around your plans while you also pull your own weight will take you far today.","Everything is moving quickly and you’ll need to be able to keep up with the pace if you’re going to succeed. Luckily, you now have the speed and focus to finish your to-do list in half the time and the mental prowess to absorb information that was difficult to process before. Just be careful not to skip steps and rush through things just because you can. Get a jumpstart on the day and you’ll have more done by the end than you usually do in three!","The past is seeping into the present and your feelings are coming to the surface, but someone or something may be hindering your opportunity for vulnerability. It’s okay to keep your feelings to yourself if you’re not comfortable opening up to the people you’re around, but remember that this is a day to be brave despite your worries and to power through fearfulness with authenticity. Security must come from within, and you can trust yourself to go on with confidence even if others don’t respect your personal truth.","Compromise will be needed in order to keep your relationships running smoothly today. You’re communicating with a sense of urgency and fixation and there’s the danger that you will drive people away with your impulsiveness. Obsessing over your relationships or spending too much time worrying about the actions of your enemies will cause you to waste the day. Be willing to show others how you feel through actions or gifts rather than through words, because words are more likely to cause trouble now.","Your recent accomplishments are in the spotlight within your social circle today. The people that you know and love will be happy for you and support you in your celebration. Whatever you’ve been sowing in your public life and your career, you will now be reaping. If you haven’t put in much effort, then you might see a small spark in growth, but if you’ve been committed to your progress, you’ll see a huge boost in support.","People want to connect with you and the wisdom that they have to share will be invaluable. You’ll be learning new information now that changes your perspective on how you see yourself and how you act within your relationships. A new way of thinking will help you to separate your self-image from difficult experiences in your past, breaking down the walls you have put up around your heart. Learn from the experiences of others -- it’s their gift to you.","You're taking a trip down Memory Lane today and you’re likely enjoying the view. You’ve been consumed lately with the present moment and your career, but now it’s time to take a break from this intense focus and productivity. Reaching out to a family member or a friend who you haven’t seen in a while will have you reminiscing about people and places you used to know. Let these emotions wash over you and refresh your zest for life.","The speed is picking up in your life and time is flying because you’re having fun. You’re in a phase of connecting with new friends and talking about everything under the sun, which opens doors of opportunity and creates new interests. You are communicating with intensity now, so avoid being critical or cruel. Enjoy the ride that the universe provides without trying to control where it goes -- life will go more smoothly now if you’re willing to follow its natural flow."
2021-03-01,"Our relationships with others may run into a few challenges today as an underlying issue that has been going unaddressed comes to light. Fortunately, expressing our feelings should flow easily as the emotional Moon connects with communicator Mercury at 2:27 pm EST. Hopefully the conversation will stay calm, but there’s nothing wrong with a bit of healthy conflict. If things do get tense, we can look forward to Jupiter, the planet of good luck, forming a harmonious trine with the Moon to create an opportunity for resolution.","Your desire to connect with others could lead to mental exhaustion if you're not careful. Although there is an endless variety of classes, seminars, and collaborative discussions available online, it’s easy to over-commit when you're craving engagement and interactivity. Give each endeavor the attention it deserves by whittling down your calendar and only saying yes to the events you can’t imagine missing. Your time and energy are important, so opt for the activities that spark the most joy in you.","Having a solid morning routine is key to achieving balance in your workday. It's easy to sleep through the alarm, jump in the shower, and get right to work, but you aren't at your best this way. Even a few extra minutes will help center your energy and produce a positive shift in your work and mood. Tonight, set your alarm for earlier than usual and prepare the items you need for the morning so that you can see what it's like to begin your day with peace.","It may have been a while since you allowed yourself to let go of responsibilities and have some fun. Today, make room in your busy schedule and do something spontaneous! Taking a break from the usual hustle and bustle of the everyday will provide you with fresh energy and inspire creativity in all areas of life. This doesn't have to be a major event -- even a catch-up session on Zoom with a couple friends or a walk outside will help to stir your mind and spirit.","It's out with old energy and in with the new today. This is a great time to refresh your home with some organizing and redecorating, so enlist the help of a partner or roommate and get an early start on spring cleaning. Once you've attended to your physical space, you'd be wise to do some mental and emotional tidying up, too. Though it may be easier to get rid of items in your home, releasing old ideas and beliefs is necessary if you want to bring fresh energy into your life.","Today is a good day to have that difficult conversation you’ve been putting off with someone you care about. Before initiating, take a moment to figure out exactly what you want to talk about and how to stay focused on coming to a resolution rather than harping on problems. Having this clarity will help keep things lighthearted and positive even when discussing not-so-fun subjects. Be sure you also allow the other person to share without interruption so they feel validated and affirmed.","You may have an incident happen to you today that requires you to stand up for what you believe in. Though you usually have no problem saying what’s on your mind if you know it’s the right thing to do, today’s challenge may require you to be honest and potentially hurt the feelings of someone you care about. But stay the course; although they may take it personally at first, over time this person will realize that you were doing what you felt was right.","The people in your life mean the world to you, but today you may be thinking about your life outside of your relationships with others. What really makes YOU happy and fulfilled? Today is a great day to set new goals for yourself and release anything that doesn’t seem in alignment with who you want to be. Still, this doesn’t mean you should get rid of your faithful crew! Share your new mindset with friends and loved ones so they can support you and help you stay on track.","You may feel like sticking close to home today and getting some much-needed rest. If you can, reduce your workload and block off your schedule for some chill time. It’s possible that feelings from the past will arise today and make you feel a bit off. Instead of resisting these emotions, try journaling what comes up for you and allowing yourself to feel whatever you feel. Although this process may feel uncomfortable, it can lead to a powerful healing moment.",You're no stranger to the call of the world and this is a great time to connect with your community through causes that are important to you. Technology is on your side and can make it easier to join forces even when you're apart. Spending some of your day following groups on social media and signing up for notifications of upcoming events will make you a part of the network. Use your voice to let people know what you believe in -- this is how your like-minded tribe will find you.,"You're such a diligent worker and known for getting the job done, but it's possible you've been working harder lately instead of smarter. Although you don't mind hard work, you can be far more productive and conserve valuable energy with a few adjustments. Today, take a look at your boundaries to see if there’s any tightening up you can do. Remember, too, that you don’t have to carry everything on your own. Learning to delegate tasks and ask for help when you need it is a form of self-care.","You're a big thinker and tend to have a wealth of knowledge and opinions about a wide variety of subjects. Now, it's a beneficial time to zero in on a certain topic you've been looking into for some time and give it your focused attention. Consider enrolling in a course or workshop on the subject that will help move you from novice to master. After a little training, others will be looking to you to guide them with your skills and expertise.","You might feel more sluggish than usual today and even find yourself having feelings of self-doubt. Sometimes when we feel this way, we think that something is wrong, when it’s actually the cosmos' way of getting us to slow down and turn within. Give yourself grace today and schedule time to relax and to get some deep rest. Doing something creative like listening to music or writing from your heart may help you move past any difficult feelings."
2021-03-02,"Though it's easier when things remain conflict-free in our relationships with others, sometimes a little intensity is necessary to work out the kinks lying beneath the surface. When the sensitive Moon clashes with poignant Pluto at 9:09 am EST, we could be part of a misunderstanding that requires us to lie down our egos and have heart-centered conversations. By the afternoon, the Moon enters intimate Scorpio, revealing anything that blocks our ability to connect deeply to one another.","You'll likely find yourself triggered by something outside of your control today, but pause and breathe before unloading your frustration. Sometimes external events are meant to show us that we have some unresolved issues to work through. Before reacting, think to yourself: What is this moment trying to teach me, or, what is the lesson I am being shown? From there, you’ll be able to choose an appropriate response that doesn’t put all the blame on the other person or the situation.","You are so devoted and loyal to the people around you, but sometimes the time and effort you put into others goes unnoticed and leaves you feeling unappreciated. Today, you may find yourself disappointed by a response you receive from someone you’ve gone out of your way to show you care. Instead of letting those feelings simmer, share how you are feeling. Their aloofness may not be intentional, but they may need to be reminded that your support is optional.","You may be used to waking up with energy, but could find yourself dragging a little more than usual today. Instead of trying to force yourself to be productive, honor how you are feeling and reduce your to-do list. Select the top three priorities that need to get done and leave the rest for tomorrow. With the free time you create, spend some quiet time reflecting and connecting with your thoughts. There's more happening in your inner world than your outer world today.","Home is an energizing space for you and this is exactly where you should spend some time today. A day alone or with only a couple close friends or family members will allow you to engage in projects and activities that make you feel fulfilled. This is a great day to get lost in a creative endeavor like writing, baking, or organizing, although what you do doesn't matter as long as you bond with your inner child and have some relaxing fun.","You have a big personality and it serves you well in the world, but today, you may face the realization that some people in your family don’t understand your larger-than-life views and desire for the spotlight. Though this may bring up some difficult feelings or memories, remember that you are in control of your own destiny. Just because someone doesn’t get you doesn’t mean they get to define who you are. Let the comments roll off your shoulders and continue being fabulous you.","Your ability to discriminate is your superpower, but when engaging in conversation with others today, try not to nit-pick. Yes, they said that word wrong or they're speaking their opinion based on feelings and not facts, but don’t correct them. Being too particular about how something is being done or said may make you miss an opportunity to authentically connect. Save your judgement for another time and, instead, listen beyond the words and tune into what the person is sharing.","Your mind is focused on money matters today and you may be calculating a few financial goals you’d like to achieve. Though it is natural for you to involve other people in your process, this is a good day to take ownership of your personal spending and where you can tighten up a bit. Review your bank account and take a look at where you’ve been doing the most damage -- it's quite possible you can cut a few expenses and save that money for something important.","You may feel like getting away and being alone today once the Moon enters your introspective sign. Your ability to penetrate beneath the surface of things serves you well in many areas of your life, but if you aren’t mindful of it, you may find yourself overwhelmed with the energy of others. You can remedy this by getting away from everyone for a bit to ground and recenter yourself. Clearing away energy that isn’t yours will help you regain clarity about your own wants and needs.","You are a truth-teller and you fight for what’s right, and this energy is needed in the world today. It’s important you get clear about where you want to put forth your effort and who you want to help, though, because spreading yourself too thin won’t allow you to commit as deeply as you’d like to. Today, spend some time figuring out what social injustices stir you the most and what you can do to help bring about change.","Who are the people that push you to reach greater heights? Today is a good day to check-in with those who keep you both inspired and accountable. When you put your mind to it, there’s nothing stopping you from reaching your goals, but it’s good to have people you trust and respect available to talk through strategies and roadblocks. Schedule a phone call with a mentor or shoot an email to a colleague whose opinion you respect to see when they are available. Two heads are better than one.","Your ability to see five steps ahead is a huge asset, but you may sometimes hesitate to share your great ideas to avoid being in the spotlight. Although collaboration is your strong suit, don’t underestimate your leadership skills and the value of sharing your vision. Today, if you find yourself part of any decision-making process, be sure to speak up if it seems like the group isn’t considering something that you deem important. Your thoughts may be the most important contribution necessary for success.","You have a lot of big dreams and, although some of them end up staying in your head, others are screaming to be manifested. What is the dream that has been on your mind the most lately? Today, begin to make it tangible by writing it down. Don’t judge it or dismiss it by wondering if it’s possible -- just get it on paper first. After rereading it, ask yourself, “What small step can I take in making this dream a reality?”"
2021-03-03,"Prepare to feel an emotional intensity or inner tension as the sensitive Moon is stimulated by six connections to power planets throughout the day. Though we may try our best to hold it all in, Venus' connection to awakening Uranus will make it hard to contain what we are feeling in our hearts. When action-oriented Mars enters bright and communicative Gemini at 10:30 pm EST, we’ll be ready to have difficult conversations with the faith that they will lead to change.","You are never one to hold back what needs to be said, but a little finesse could truly help you to get your point across. Barraging someone with feelings or thoughts that you need to get out can have the opposite effect than what you desire. Instead, take a moment to think about WHY you are saying what you are, how the other person may receive it, and the result you’d like to achieve. From there, you can make adjustments to your approach.","You know a thing or two about working hard and saving money, but you're also a provider, and you can get derailed from your long-term financial goals because of your dedication to making sure your loved ones are provided for. Today, take a moment to review your money habits to see where adjustments can be made. Being able to help out when needed does feel good, but it’s also important to maintain a balance between your own security and supporting others.","Your mind has been pondering your next move lately and the best strategy to reach your goals. If you’ve been keeping track of your ideas, go back to review them today. What are the top three things you’d like to pursue in the next 6-8 weeks? Though you are great at multi-tasking, it’s best if you focus your mighty brainpower on manifesting just a few goals so that other areas of life don’t end up suffering. Balancing what you already have is key when pursuing new ambitions!","You may feel that you need to let a hurtful experience with a family member slide without sharing how you feel. This could be because you don’t want to come off as sensitive or you may not want to hurt their feelings, however, if you don’t talk about it, there's no way they can know that they've done something wrong. Other people can’t read our minds even if we think we are being obvious, so speaking up is always the best option for authentic and effective communication.","You may have been enjoying some down time, but your social life is about to get a major reboot. Before you jump back out there, take a moment to tune in with yourself. It can be easy to lose sight of your true needs and desires when you spend a lot of time with other people. Make sure you are clear about your path so you can align yourself with like-minded individuals who will support you along the way.","Though you don't mind leading from behind the scenes, you’ve been feeling a little unappreciated lately. You love to see a project from start to finish, but you may find yourself with much of the heavy load without getting a lot of kudos at completion. Today, think about ways that you can prevent overburdening yourself with work and begin to share the load. Remember, asking for assistance isn’t a weakness -- it will actually free up time for you to step into leadership!","You naturally put a lot of time and energy into your partnerships, but today, you may find that you're a bit burnt out by the emotional needs of others and desire a moment to recenter yourself. Excuse yourself from being everyone’s therapist and take a moment to hang out alone. This would be a great time to watch a rom-com or any movie that gives you faith in the ability to restore relationships and live happily ever after.","You’ve been doing a lot of thinking about who you are, who you’ve been, and who you want to be in the future. Are there any people or situations that you need to release in order to be your most authentic self? Have you been overextending yourself to others so much that you are beginning to feel resentful? Today, you’ll get the spark to start shifting your life and make decisions that are in alignment with your personal happiness and soul development.","You get a lot of motivation and inspiration for your goals when you spend time interacting with others, but there’s another side of you that appreciates time to go into your cave of solitude and dive into fascinating subjects and spiritual realms. Today, choose the latter and indulge in some quiet alone time where you can work to understand something more deeply. Once you've had this interlude, then you may want to call up a close friend to share your new insights.","Do you have structures in place that help to sustain the energy you give to your career? What does your morning and evening routine look like? If the answer to these questions is a big shrug, it’s time for a change! Research shows that there is power in waking up even fifteen minutes earlier than usual to greet the day and ending your day by writing down three things you are grateful for. Start today and try it for a week to see how you feel!","You have a million ideas and pride yourself on your mental prowess, but how often do you flex your creative muscles? It can be easier to stay in thinking mode than to actually construct something, but seeing an idea to fruition will bring you fulfillment and progress. Creativity is unique to you -- whether you are an artist, scientist, or gifted in another field, the purpose is to take something that is just an idea or dream and make it tangible. This will take time, so start today!","As a sensitive soul, you’ve learned how to put up boundaries to avoid absorbing the energy of your loved ones -- be proud of this and give yourself grace if you slip into old habits. Still, while it’s important to take accountability for your happiness, it’s also important to see when someone is trying to manipulate you into doing what they want you to do. This may be the case today, and you'll want to put a stop to it immediately by calling it out."
2021-03-04,"We may feel a bit restless or bored with our usual routine, making it difficult to complete tasks that usually take little effort. What we really want is to feel passion -- something that is invigorating to the spirit and radiating to the soul. With the adventure-seeking Sagittarius Moon crossing paths with action-oriented Mars at 6:32 pm EST, it’s a great time to switch things up and try something spontaneous. Since mental Mercury is uniting with expansive Jupiter, anything that broadens the mind will feel satisfying.","You aren’t one for staying put as it is, but today, this inner restlessness is making you want to bounce off the walls! Try not to have that extra cup of coffee, as tempting as it may be. You’ll already have endless energy to get through your day and a caffeine rush might have you talking a mile a minute, challenging others to keep up. Make a point to fill your day with stimulating activities that will utilize your brainpower and move your body.","Building for the future is important to you, but have you checked in with yourself lately to see if your current actions are in alignment with your long-term goals? It can be easy to lose focus when you are in the daily grind, but taking a moment to revisit your plans will give you the clarity to get back on track if need be. This is a great day to take a solo walk in nature to ground yourself and clear your mind.","You have the awesome ability to see things from multiple angles, but today, a friend’s inflexibility may cause you frustration. If you find yourself battling against a perspective that completely differs from yours, try to stay calm. Remember, you are naturally more of a “go with the flow” type of person, but others need more certainty before moving forward. Meet people in the middle by asking what they need to feel more comfortable and doing what you can to provide it.","You do all you can to support the goals of your loved ones, but when was the last time you allowed yourself to dream about your own future? Today, you may find yourself getting distracted from your usual tasks and routines as you consider your wants and desires. Just for a moment, think about what you want regardless of everything and everyone else. Remember: When your cup is full, you’re able to give to everyone else from a place of abundance.","You usually like to keep things lighthearted, but it’s so easy to get bogged down with tasks and daily responsibilities. Today, throw caution to the wind and have some fun! Call up your partner in crime to do something exciting, or, if getting together in person is out of the picture, try scheduling an online watch party or game night with a larger group of friends. Whatever you choose to do, leave your to-do list for tomorrow, because today is all about bringing a smile to your face.","Showing up for others is your gift and it makes you feel good to know that people feel they can count on you. But, have you been making yourself so available to the larger cause that you’ve sacrificed too much personal time? If you find yourself complaining a lot or not feeling well, it’s time to press pause on everything else and schedule some self-care time. Don’t worry, people will be supportive of this and understand that rest is necessary!","Conflict makes you cringe, which can result in you holding back your true thoughts and feelings to keep the peace. However, today you'll be in a position where you have no choice but to voice your honest opinion about a situation or person. Though it may be hard, speaking up and using your natural skills of negotiation can be exactly what is needed to usher in a resolution. Through using your voice, you’ll authentically receive the peaceful environment you desire.","You have the ability to persevere through life’s toughest challenges, but what can you actively do to create an environment for yourself that truly feels as safe and secure? Today, be mindful of unconsciously trying to control everything around you as a means to feel safe and guard yourself from harm. Instead, begin using your voice to ask for the support you need from others. Remember that no one can read your mind! Ask and you shall receive.","People love to seek out your advice when dealing with the things life throws their way, but today, you may be a little frustrated by a loved one who constantly asks for help but does the opposite of what would be in their best interest. Instead of chewing them out, try a different approach. Maybe implementing reverse psychology by subtly encouraging good behavior through suggesting the opposite would work. If not, it might be best to give them space to figure it out on their own.","It's easy for you to put your head down and power toward the completion of your goals, but today, pause and ask yourself why you are working so hard. Perhaps it's necessary as you near an important deadline, however, if you’ve found yourself overworked and undervalued for a while, it may be time to set new boundaries around your time and energy. It can be difficult to balance work and personal time, but it’s necessary for a healthy and fulfilling life.","It will be refreshing to get out of your own head and connect with friends today, however you can. Though you usually go along with whatever others want to discuss or do, today is a good day to suggest something more unconventional and interesting to you. You may hesitate to bring up an idea, thinking your friends won't be interested, but give them a chance! Talking about or sharing in something you enjoy will make them appreciate you even more.","You are strongly influenced by energy, so it's important you feel the right vibe in the most important parts of your life. Does the work you do still feel in alignment with who you are as a whole? Though working hard and achieving goals is important, a big part of you also needs space to dream and access your creativity. If you can't find the time to nourish this side of your soul, it's a sign that you need to make some changes to your life balance."
2021-03-05,"We feel an inner conflict today between spending time with and serving others versus freely exploring our own lives, untethered to responsibilities and other people's needs. When the Moon in honest and sometimes brash Sagittarius clashes with Venus in compassionate Pisces at 10:58 am EST, choosing what feels best for ourselves may unintentionally hurt someone else's feelings. Communicating our true intentions and planning to spend quality time together at a later date can help to smooth over any fallout.","Though you are usually pretty high-energy, your fuel tank has been running low lately. Instead of pumping yourself full of energy drinks to keep going, this is actually a sign that you need a little self-care. If being quiet and meditating is not your style, you can get the same effect by going for a run in nature or taking a hot bath and pampering yourself. Whatever self-care tool you choose, be intentional about it and it will rejuvenate you for days to come.","You go above and beyond for the things and people you care about, but lately, you may have been questioning your loyalty to some of the groups and communities you are involved with. If it’s been harder to remember your “why,” take time today to do some self-reflection. You may realize that you've outgrown these affiliations, but it's also possible that you’ve taken on too many responsibilities and are feeling overwhelmed. The solution may be as simple as asking for help.","One of your casual partnerships could lead to a great work opportunity, but you may not see it at first if you are maintaining distance or focused on fun instead of work. You have many friends and every person in your life serves a purpose -- today, pay attention to the words and actions of those you know to see how they might be in alignment with your future plans. If you are too busy whizzing off to the next thing, you'll miss your chance!","Being such an empath, it’s easy for you to take on the woes of the world around you, which makes self-care especially important in order to sustain a healthy and happy life. Creating a spiritual practice and applying it every day is a great way to learn how to surrender your problems to a force bigger than yourself. Sometimes the simpler the routine, the better; even sipping tea in front of a sunny window in the morning can be a great way to release tension and show gratitude.","Your personality is so fun and you love to spread joy to everyone around you, but it can be easy for you to slip into being influenced by fears about how people may perceive you. Today, do a check-in to see if you’ve been suppressing your self-expression to avoid being judged by others. Remember, you don’t have to perform for anyone -- you are meant to bring light and love to the world by being your authentic self! The only person’s opinion that truly matters is your own.","Your devotion to your loved ones is unmatched, but if you let fear have its way, the love you have for them can be tainted with a bit of control. Today, take a deep breath before telling someone how you really feel about the things they are doing. This can be hard to do when they are doing things you don’t agree with, but sometimes the best way to show someone you love them is to honor their freedom to choose how they live their life.","Your leadership skills and ability to negotiate could really serve a greater purpose in your community and bring you profound fulfillment in return. Today, do some research to find a humanitarian cause or world issue that moves you to want to take action. It may be animal rights, racial justice, equal pay, or any other concern that speaks to your heart. Look online for organizations and movements that could use your influence and your unwavering dedication to what is right.","You are one to take life pretty seriously and you work hard to provide a secure life for yourself and your loved ones. Although this serves a greater purpose most of the time, don’t forget to enjoy yourself, too! Today, take a break from the daily grind and free your inner child. Have a 10-minute dance party in your living room, watch a comedy movie, or eat dessert for dinner. One night of freedom and fun will be healing to your soul.","You may have to forgo your freedom today for something that needs to be taken care of at home, which can end up making you feel resentful. Though your annoyance is understandable, this can be a great lesson in taking care of our responsibilities right away rather than putting them off for another time. No worries, once you are finished, you can get back to your regularly scheduled program with the reassurance that everything is complete and in its proper place.","You may be feeling emotional today, but you aren’t typically one to dwell on feelings. Still, you might notice that you’re having a harder time pushing yourself to complete your tasks as the day goes on. You may need a moment just to gather your thoughts; talking it out with a good friend whose perspective you respect may also be a helpful antidote. Give one of your supporters a call -- even taking 30 minutes to share how you are feeling can completely shift your mood.","You pretty much get along with anyone, Aquarius, but you will not tolerate any behavior that clashes with the values you hold dearest to you. Today, you may question the integrity of someone in your inner circle. Whether it’s something you witness with your own eyes or it’s something you hear about, invoke your inner activist and speak up about it. Confronting the issue from a space of openness is the most loving thing you can do.","You’re known for your compassion and sensitivity and this extends into your professional life. However, it looks like you've been devoting a lot of emotional energy toward your work lately and you're reaching burnout. Today is a good day to check in with yourself to see if there are boundaries that you need to put in place. Your heart is big, but it has its limits. If this isn’t the case for you, then today's energies are a message for you to take some “me time” to rest and rejuvenate."
2021-03-06,"We find ourselves thinking expansively about solutions to the world’s problems and what we can do to help. With the Moon's supportive sextile to optimistic Jupiter in humanitarian Aquarius at 12:07 am EST, we come to the realization that, with a little innovation, we are more than capable of saving ourselves. The Moon then connects with mental Mercury and downloads from the cosmos turn into big ideas in our minds. Luna's entry into organized Capricorn this evening helps us turn these ideas into reality.","Your inner pioneer has been activated and you want to do something that makes a difference in the world. Today is a good day to gather a group of like-minded people to brainstorm ideas and solutions for a cause that is important to you. Your natural leadership skills and enthusiastic spirit will get everyone excited about their contributions. Just don’t spend too much time focused on generating a bunch of ideas -- taking action, no matter how small, is what matters most!","You may be resenting the harshness of the world around you at the moment and that is completely understandable. Your sign values safety and stability and there’s a lot happening that doesn’t make you feel very secure. However, don’t give up! You are powerful and known for your ability to create a future that is built on strong values and honoring differences. Your viewpoints are important and needed, so when you witness injustice, speak up -- your voice gives permission for others to do the same.","Your skills in connecting and communicating give you the ability to relate to people from all walks of life. This puts you in a position to really understand various viewpoints and share your birds-eye perspective with others in conversation. However, this also puts you at risk to be asked to discuss topics that are uncomfortable and filled with bias. If this happens today, don’t hesitate to establish boundaries and exit the conversation. You can respect differences in opinions yet stand firm in your beliefs.","Your work environment has been feeling more “every person for themselves” rather than collaborative lately, and that doesn’t sit well with you. You care about your colleagues, but most importantly, the work suffers when the team isn’t coming together. Today, take the initiative to get everyone back on the same page. If the opportunity presents itself in a group meeting, speak up and share your wish to work together toward a common goal. It’s likely there are others that feel the same way.","You've maybe been a bit cooped up lately, but all work and no play can make things quite dull and you are ready to do something spontaneous to switch it up. Tune in to your inner child today by doing something that feels like play! Go for a walk and explore places in your neighborhood, try a new game, or make some popcorn and watch a funny movie. Whatever activity you choose, having a great time is required -- your spirit needs nourishment!","Spending time with loved ones can be good for your soul today. You’ve been working hard and putting in a lot of your time and energy into your career, and it’s good to let the people that care about you fill you up with their love and positivity. Take a look at your to-do list; where can you enlist the help of a friend or family member to make a few of your not-so-fun tasks more fun? It’s possible to bring joy into the smallest moments of your life.","You love your friends so much and cherish your one-on-one time with them but, of course, life and daily responsibilities can get in the way of quality time and conversation. Today is a great day to call a good friend that you haven’t spoken to in a while to catch up. Although you may be tempted to talk about deeper topics and emotions, keeping things light will let your heart be light, and you could use that right now.","There's energy buzzing right now around the things that you value most in life. With the world in such uncertain times, things like your accomplishments, family, health, and bank account may all have been taking up space in your mind. Today, take a moment to journal and process what you hold nearest and dearest. If you find that you’ve been putting too much of yourself into things that don’t hold as much value, set an intention to change that today.","The way you think about things is a little different than everyone else and others could benefit from hearing your perspective. If you’ve been considering sharing your thoughts on social media, this is a great day to do so. People are inclined to listen and you have the ability to make correlations and points that they may not have considered before. If you put yourself out there, though, don’t take offense if you receive some pushback. Honor different beliefs by welcoming respectful debate.","You tend to support rules and structures because they make things run more smoothly, but lately, you may have been wondering if the rules are actually fair to everyone. While you value organization and strong leadership, you also aren’t afraid to tear it all down and rebuild a system that works for all involved. Today, share your thoughts and concerns with a few people you respect and admire. Others value what you have to say and this conversation could be the beginning of a new venture.","With your altruistic heart, you aren’t a stranger to bringing issues to the awareness of everyone around you. You see a lot that could be changed or improved and you're eager to do your part in making the world a better place. If you haven’t already, this is a great day to join in on a cause you feel passionate about. If the group you are looking for doesn’t exist yet, start one! All the change could start with you.","Whether you're working today or taking care of other important responsibilities, everyone you interact with is in a pretty good mood and eager to talk and share. You may find yourself in a lot of chit-chat conversations, where topics stray from the task at hand. Choose who you decide to engage with carefully, especially if the conversation turns into gossip. Connecting with people is awesome, but utilizing your boundaries helps to keep you focused and preserve your peace."
2021-03-07,"We start off in a pretty good mood and it seems like everyone else is feeling the same. As we spend the day working toward a positive sextile between the emotional Moon and pleasant Venus, love flows easily and life feels rich. We are still up for some emotional excitement, however, thanks to Luna's trine with shake-things-up Uranus. The only thing to watch out for is the Moon's clashing square with wounded Chiron early in the day, which could bring an unwelcome shift in mood. Remember, it's all temporary.","You may feel good about the work week ahead because you are excited about collaborating with some really cool and intelligent people. Sometimes the best outcome of working with people you respect is the inspiration you leave with and the feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself. These people feel the same as you do, so don’t hesitate to share some of your great ideas! If some people don’t like them, that’s okay -- they may be useful at another time, so it's worth speaking up.","Your mind is thirsty today and you will thrive by spending the day relaxing and reading a good book, watching an educational show, or texting powerful quotes and affirmations to your friends. They’ll appreciate you thinking about them and sharing things that move you. If you find yourself going down a rabbit hole of knowledge that interests you, consider taking it a step further and signing up for a class on that topic. There's a reason you are so intrigued by it, so give your brain more space to explore.","You’re always connected to a ton of people and may spend a good bit of each day on your phone and social media keeping up with everyone. Today, however, quality is more important than quantity as you are craving more closeness than you typically need in your friendships. This is a great day to call up one of your besties -- someone you can have deeper conversations with and who gets how your busy brain works. You’ll leave the conversation feeling loved, understood, and rejuvenated!","You always have your family on your mind and are often thinking about ways to support them better. However, it can be overwhelming to take on the concerns of the group every day and you may often overlook other individuals that are close to you. Just for today, take a pause from managing how your whole family functions and pay attention to the one person who looks out for you while you are looking out for everyone else. Quality time together will rejuvenate you both.","You'll wake feeling pretty good this morning and starting off your day with a solid self-care routine will ensure your high vibes continue as the day goes on. Begin with a grounding activity like exercise or stretching to bring awareness to your body after a long night of dreaming. From there, embrace your inner child and choose whatever activities make you feel good. Anything that you find fun or energizing will help to create a positive mood that will carry you forward.","Although you feel at ease when your mind is busy, your mental processes need a break occasionally to be able to perform at their best. If you have a lot of tedious tasks ahead of you today, leave the more taxing stuff for tomorrow and use your time to do something enjoyable that will revive your spirit. If you have a lot of chores or errands on your agenda, put a little fun in them by collaborating with a friend and working together to knock out your to-do lists.","Your interpersonal relationships are what keep you going and this is a great day to spend time with loved ones. Everyone will be in a good mood and enjoy being around each other. Even if you can't host a gathering for extended family and friends, think about throwing a little ""just because"" party for the people you live with. Create an atmosphere that is light and cheerful and focus on loving and celebrating each other and how far you've come together.","Diving deep into learning a new skill or hobby is a great way to engage your intense determination and focus. Today, create a list of action steps that will get you to this goal. How much would it cost and how much time do you have to dedicate toward this new venture? Is this something you can do in your free time, or will you need the support of family and friends to get it done? Timing is everything and answering these questions will help you decide what to do.","You love to get out and about and you can see the value in spending money on experiences that leave you feeling inspired, educated, and connected to friends and family. Lately, though, you may have been thinking about tightening up your finances and saving for the future. It doesn't have to be all or nothing -- setting aside a specific budget for entertainment or travel will allow you to have some fun while still being responsible about your future.","Talking about your accomplishments is part of the fun of setting goals for you, and this is a great day to call up your crew and share how your journey is going. Not everyone gets where your drive comes from or why you push yourself so hard, but they do admire your tenacity. The awesome thing about sharing your progress is that your friends can also be your accountability partners. They'll applaud your efforts while also reminding you to keep a healthy life balance.","You spend so much time connecting and communicating with others that, today, you may just feel like being alone awhile and geeking out on the hobbies that bring you personal joy. People will still be reaching out for your attention, but don’t feel bad if you choose to turn off your phone or work behind closed doors. Be honest with loved ones and let them know you need some time to yourself, but you'll be happy to reconnect with them later.","Your phone may be ringing off the hook today and you could find yourself having back-to-back catch-up sessions with friends and plans to do things at home with loved ones in the evening. Though this energy fills you up with good feelings, pay attention to how your energy and mood as the day goes on. It will be so easy to get swept up in the good vibes that you don’t realize you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed until you reach a breaking point."
2021-03-08,"We get a little breathing room from the daily grind and rush of events today. Thanks to the emotional Moon's supportive sextile to the confident Sun, even when things come up, we feel like we can handle them without the usual turmoil. When the Moon links up with dreamy Neptune at 9:41 am EST, we may feel sensitive to other people’s moods, so we should choose who we spend time with carefully. If not, dark emotions may be stirred as the Moon and revealing Pluto meet in serious Capricorn later on.","Your workday may feel smoother than expected and you’re able to get things done without any major snags. Even when faced with small issues that would normally make you want to pull your hair out, you’re able to just breathe and find a quick solution. However, this doesn’t mean that everyone else is feeling the same. Stay away from anyone whose mood seems particularly negative or frazzled so that your day ends on a positive note!","The world is calling you and, although travel is limited at this time, there’s still a way to get some of the cultural experiences you crave while at home. Today, tap into your inner chef and make an international cuisine that will make you feel like you’re in foreign lands. There are tons of food blogs and cooking shows available; choose one that piques your interest and inspires you to learn more. This meal is meant to nourish both your body and your spirit for adventure.","Your ability to generate long-term wealth is energized today and you may have a ton of ideas to get started. But while your brainpower is unmatched, try not to overwhelm yourself by researching too many things at once. Instead, pick one or two strategies and identify all the action steps you will need to take to reach your goals. Finding a mentor or financial coach to guide you may also be helpful with keeping you on track.","Spending some quality time with a loved one will be especially fulfilling today, especially if it’s been a while since you've caught up. This may be someone you used to worry about in the past, but through the conversation, you'll learn that they are doing pretty well. Your job in this moment is to trust them -- don’t let your mind create issues where there are none. If they say they are fine and life is good, believe them.","After a chaotic stretch, it's finally time to bring some ease into your daily routine. Start the day by stretching your body, clearing your mind, and finding three things to be grateful for. As you go about your day, notice how you let mishaps roll off your shoulders due to your high vibes! However, be aware that negative people may be attracted to your light -- stay away from energy vampires who will suck the good mood right out of you.","Your analytical mind is always thinking, plotting, and planning, but you need to give yourself a brain break from time to time so you don’t run out of gas. Try a creative activity today that still allows you to use your gift of paying attention to details, like knitting, making or playing music, or coloring in an adult coloring book. The idea is to relax the constant chatter in your brain while also doing something that keeps your attention.","Projects around the house are calling your attention and it would be great to enlist the help of a loved one to assist you. This is an opportunity for the two of you to catch up if life has had you both focused on other things. If they seem to be going through a hard time at the moment, sympathize with them and hold space for their feelings, but there’s no need to try to fix things for them. Practice listening.","You aren’t a stranger to personal transformation and you fully understand the importance of having a positive mindset when going through difficult times. Your knowledge and insight can be useful to people who are facing challenges, and today would be a good day to share what you know. If you know someone personally that could use your advice, reach out to them and see if they are open. Otherwise, utilizing social media to share some of your wisdom could help people far and wide.","You thrive when connecting with friends and value the richness of the conversations that take place, however, there may be a few “bad eggs” in your group that tend to bring down the collective mood. You don’t have to stop being their friend, but it would be a good idea today to check in with them to see what’s going on. They may not even realize the impact they’re having and will appreciate you saying something about it.","Conversations with loved ones flow easily today, inspiring you to share more than usual. But while you may love that others feel comfortable enough to share with you in return, make sure you are maintaining your boundaries and not secretly figuring out how to help them fix their problems. Sometimes just openly sharing your past struggles and how you overcame them will be enough to help them figure it out. If they need your help beyond that, trust that they will ask you directly.","You naturally think about what everyone else needs, which means you may often unintentionally put yourself last. Spending time alone today to identify and sort through the thoughts and feelings you’ve been dealing with will help you to recenter. What’s been nagging at you most lately? Whatever you do, don’t distract yourself by watching TV or trying to fix someone else’s life -- instead, pull out your journal or do some meditating to identify how you are truly feeling.","Though you enjoy your alone time, spending time with others is good for your soul. It can be hard to pull yourself out of your comfortable reverie though -- the thought of having to coordinate schedules, choose an activity, and agree on distancing protocols can make you want to stay in and watch TV instead. But don’t build it up to be bigger than it is! Just start up a few text threads and see where conversations or plans go. No matter what, connecting will feel inspiring."
2021-03-09,"Today we'll have more courage and confidence than usual, and we'll be able to use this energy to initiate honest conversations with others without being offensive. When the progressive Aquarius Moon clashes with variety-loving Uranus at 5:06 pm EST, we may feel motivated to jump into a new project -- but we shouldn’t be too hasty in making new commitments. When the Moon connects with ambitious Saturn later in the evening, we'll be reminded of the importance of not putting too much pressure on what we think we should be.","You may have been feeling like your friends have been super busy lately, and while you respect and understand that they have a lot going on, you can’t help but feel a little left out of their lives. Today is a good day to share how you are feeling with your closest friends. They may not have even realized how much time has passed since you all last connected. Sometimes a gentle nudge is all that is needed to get the crew together again.","Obtaining a high level of success is a goal that almost every working person wants to achieve, but sometimes that comes at a cost. It's possible you'll face a conflict between your personal values and someone else’s professional goals today. You may consider yourself a team player, but are you willing to go against something you feel strongly about? Before you make that decision, take a moment to view it from all sides. If it still doesn’t sit well with you, don’t do it.","You are multi-faceted, Gemini, which makes it easy for you to have friends from all walks of life. But mixing and mingling with so many people for too long can leave you feeling a bit disconnected from your authentic self. Before picking up your phone or entertaining friends or colleagues today, take a moment to center and ground yourself. Let your mind wander back to what’s most important to you so you can focus your magical mental powers on your own desires and dreams.","Taking care of others comes so naturally to you that if you aren’t careful, you can end up putting everyone else before yourself. This may be the situation you find yourself in now. Is there someone you’ve been lacking boundaries with who has also taken your kindness for granted? Today is a good day to have an honest conversation with them about how you are feeling. Together you can work out a plan for support that respects each other’s boundary lines and maintains your relationship.","While chatting with a friend today, you may both realize you're passionate about similar things, and that could lead to brainstorming ideas of how to work together in a greater capacity. Though you're both really excited, make sure you aren’t rushing into anything too fast. First, determine your ""why."" Why do you want to work with this person, and how would the two of you being in partnership aid a collective effort? Solid answers to these questions will signify a business match made in heaven!","You may run into an issue at work today that is more complicated than you anticipated and finding a solution could take some out-of-the-box thinking. Whatever you do, don’t panic. Yes, you usually are the one who has all the answers, but in this case, being willing to ask for assistance will help solve the problem much more quickly. Not only will people be ready to lend support, you’ll be seen as a strong leader who is willing to follow for the benefit of everyone involved.","Today is a great day to have a good time! While it’s nice to be able to video chat and instantly connect with someone without having to leave your home, nothing beats having a face-to-face interaction. Grab a good friend and find a way to have some socially-distanced fun. You could find a new outdoor path to walk as you catch up, or you may try a takeout restaurant neither of you has been to before. These simple acts could provide you with the excitement you’ve been craving.","If you've been side-eyeing your living space lately because it doesn’t seem to fit your style anymore, today is a great day to do a few minor updates. Decorating doesn’t have to be a daunting task -- sometimes just getting new pillows for the couch or painting an accent wall can change the whole vibe of the room. Don’t be afraid to add a few eccentric pieces that are near and dear to your heart. You'll be surprised at how a few tweaks will make you feel more at home.","You aren’t afraid to say what’s on your mind and pride yourself on being the person to keep it real, even when others are afraid to do so. Though this is commendable, there is a way to be blunt and honest without trampling on another person’s self-esteem. What may seem like common sense to you may be more abstract to others. Instead of assuming that others should know what you already know, take time today to fill in any gaps in their information. You'll both be better off for it.","You’re a hard worker, and your ambition and skillful way of taking care of business has not gone unnoticed by those who are leaders in your professional circle. It’s possible a new opportunity or promotion could be on the horizon at work today. Before accepting, make sure that it is fully aligned with the path you have planned for yourself. Though you may have to compromise a little, the most important thing is that this feels like a step up rather than a horizontal move.","Though you are a social Air sign, you need more time alone to reboot than most others do. However, you may have gotten too comfortable relaxing at home and living life behind a computer or cellphone screen. Today, back away from your electronic devices and go out into the real world. Go for a walk in some fresh air or meet up with a friend or family member to catch up. To your surprise, you may find that these things also recharge your batteries.","You may have found yourself easily drained and craving time alone lately. Don’t be afraid to honor these feelings and schedule time in your ""cave."" This can be a great opportunity to dive into your creativity in some way or connect to a force higher than yourself by engaging in a spiritual practice. If you are worried about people wondering where you are, this can be easily prevented by sending your loved ones a message telling them you’re doing some self-care. They will more than likely understand."
2021-03-10,"There will be an air of optimism as the humanitarian Aquarius Moon cozies up to jovial Jupiter in Aquarius today, giving us a strong sense of confidence as we move throughout the day. When the Sun connects with Neptune in compassionate Pisces at 7:01 pm EST, we'll be more sensitive to other people and could even put their well-being over our own. Once the logical Aquarius Moon meets up with chatty Mercury later this evening, we'll have the power to communicate our emotions more effectively.","You have a powerful group of confidantes by your side whenever you need them, and you should try to pay it forward today. Having the ability to be a leader and show people the way can get you out of your own head and put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Make it your intention to support them emotionally, physically, or any way they need it now. Being invested not only makes your life better but it also enriches the lives of everyone around you.","When one door closes, another will open, and that open door could come in the form of you receiving good news regarding money or professional matters today. This could be about a position of leadership or an opportunity for more responsibility. Do the appropriate follow-up and stay focused on what you want. This is a great day to lay the foundation for change and prepare for a new future. Think about the ways your achievements fill your soul and let your imagination manifest your dream job.","You could make progress today when it comes to identifying your feelings and responding appropriately. Interaction with authority figures and other people that you look up to will be a big theme for you, and it’s possible that a conversation with these individuals can be the spark to creating something you’ve been envisioning for your life. The key is to play it smooth; your emotions can feed your actions, so listen as much as possible before sharing your goals and dreams.","You may have to have a heart-to-heart talk with someone close to you today, particularly regarding financial matters and the resources you share together. Your values are shifting, and it’s time to do a check-in to make sure you’re both on the same page. Speak openly and honestly but try to leave the emotions out of it. Being logical is your best play in this situation. Don’t hold anything in though -- getting things off your chest will help you both feel better.","This could be a good day to have a deep conversation about how loyal you are to someone you're close with, getting clear about each other's expectations. Having a partner in crime is lovely, but you should ensure this other person is willing to invest as much as you are. Though it can be hard to have such an intimate conversation, it’s likely that you are both ready to make a big move, a promise, or enter into a partnership of some kind with one another.","Your health could be on your mind today, and you'll feel a big drive to change things up. For example, you may be learning that you'd be more productive if you focus on a few things at a time instead of trying to tackle your entire to-do list. It’s important to marry your logical and emotional brains -- just because you can do something doesn’t always mean you should. Fix your mindset on realistic goals and ask your friends to hold you accountable.","You’re at your best when you dedicate yourself to a creative project or talent. With responsibilities occupying your mind rather than the desire to socialize with others, you mean business today and will likely get a lot done. Follow your instincts; if you feel you should spend extra time on something to make sure it’s done right, go for it. Be mindful of putting too much pressure on yourself to be perfect and take short breaks to safeguard against burnout.","You may feel pretty even-keeled today, as nothing will be out of the ordinary. This is a good day to keep the vibe high and avoid anything or anyone that will strip away your current level of emotional comfort. Spending time at home will protect you against circumstances that could potentially trigger you, and luxuriating in an environment that is supportive allows you to exhale any lingering tension. Having to deal with chaos all the time is exhausting, so embrace this change of pace with open arms.","You are always looking for the next thing to upgrade your mindset, and today you may realize you’ve outgrown some of the groups and activities you’re involved in. Check in with yourself; if you aren’t excited about tending to them anymore, it’s time to say goodbye. Look for things that are fulfilling for your soul rather than something you do for socialization. Be creative and find what resonates with who you are and who you're becoming instead of signing up for what you are already familiar with.","Your mind is on your money today as you consider your need for more security and structure. If there’s something financially you’ve been worried about lately, a solution you hadn’t thought of could reveal itself, such as a new source of income. Paying attention to the details is key here; you are more disciplined and focused on realigning your money goals to have more predictability. Don’t doubt yourself -- you’ve got this. As long as you follow your routine, everything will work out as planned.","You’re being called to work on yourself today, which could lead to external situations that make you feel less than confident. Put your well-being first by looking at the ways you need to set boundaries and be more devoted to yourself. Doing this will help empower you and release the pressure to be anything but yourself. You are a very determined person and know how to work towards mastery in pursuit of your ultimate goals. Allow people to support you where you could use assistance.","If something has been bothering you lately, take a step back and do something good for your emotional wellness today. Make getting rest your priority and avoid anything or anyone that will make you feel rundown. It’s time to allow a cycle, pattern, or behavior in your life that is no longer serving you come to a close. If letting go seems too hard, enlist the help of a trustworthy friend or professional to help you navigate your new reality."
2021-03-11,"We may feel sleepier, sluggish, and easily swayed by our emotions after the sensitive Moon enters compassionate Pisces this morning. Keeping tasks to a minimum and taking it easy will set our day up to be as calm and peaceful as possible. However, we'll need to choose our words carefully when connecting with friends when the Moon clashes with feisty Mars in chatty Gemini at 6:16 pm EST. Giving ourselves and others patience and grace will alleviate any miscommunication or misunderstandings that could take place.","Most days you are ready to hit the streets and take care of business, but it might be a little different now. You could be inclined to lay low and spend time in the background as the Moon enters a more reclusive and introspective part of your chart today. While you are in your self-imposed cave, you might receive some important news that you’ve been waiting for. There may have been a delay, but now that you’ve gotten the resolution you wanted, you can choose the best course of action going forward.","With the Moon entering your community and social network life sector today, you’ll be more open-minded and positive, with a desire for more intimate connection with friends. Even if other people have been a little confusing or suspicious lately, it will be a good day to share vulnerable feelings with one another to get clarity about what exactly has been happening. It’s possible that holding space for deep feelings in this way can make one of you reveal something that can change the course of the friendship.","You could run into some delays or setbacks at work today, but try not to let it cramp your style. Timing is everything and there’s an art to putting things in place and being patient for it to manifest. Of course, this is easier said than done, especially when you are craving validation from someone at the top. But don’t let your tunnel vision make you miss the recognition from your team around you. And no matter what, pat yourself on the back if nobody else will.","Helping your friends and family with whatever they need is so important to you, yet some of your loved ones may have been hard to reach or understand lately. Is it because you’ve been miscommunicating with each other? Today is a good day to share your thoughts and feelings while allowing them to be vulnerable with you too. Practice active listening by paying attention to their expressed needs and not just doing or telling them what you think is best for them.","If you and a close friend have been butting heads recently, it could have been caused by not talking about an elephant in the room. Instead of nitpicking and complaining about things to each other, take the lead today and share what’s really on your mind. It's a great time to shed light on what’s really going on in your friendship beneath the surface. Though this conversation will be rewarding, it won’t be easy, so take your time and organize your thoughts before sharing them.","It’s possible that a slight misunderstanding between you and a business partner or colleague could spiral into a bigger issue if you don’t nip it in the bud right away. With the fuzzy Pisces Moon moving into your partnership zone today, paying too much attention to the nuances of the situation can make you overanalyze unnecessarily. Ask questions to get clarity and better insight, especially before signing any contracts or agreements. Take your time to revise and process together before making any final commitments now.","You may find yourself bored with your usual daily routine today, but it can be hard to change things up when it seems to be working so well. After all, if it’s not broken, don’t fix it! Before doing an overhaul and tossing out anything, think about the feeling or vibe you desire to create. If your day is feeling too predictable, start small and add a little flair. Even something as small as listening to a new podcast or calling a friend you haven't talked to in a while can do the trick.","You might be more reflective than usual today and could get a bit nostalgic about your life: past, present, and future. This is a great day to capture your thoughts and memories in a creative way, such as writing down your experiences or gathering old photos and putting them in new frames. As you ruminate on past times, find at least three moments to show gratitude for relating to the lessons you've learned and the memories you've created along the way.","Someone from your past may pop up today, and their presence will invoke memories that you may not have thought about in a long time. Moments like these are less about the other person and more of a cosmic reminder of who you were at that point of your life. After chatting with this blast from your past, find a quiet place to reflect. You could find yourself having a psychological breakthrough and a deeper understanding of who you are.","You aren’t one to bite your tongue, but sometimes your directness can be discouraging to people who need more validation and coddling than you are accustomed to giving. If you are sensing some pushback today, be sure to ask for further explanation in any conversations with others before jumping to conclusions. This will help clear up any misunderstandings on your end, as long as you remain open enough to truly hear their perspective. Once you recognize what is going on, you can adjust your approach and tone where necessary.","Money is on your mind today as the Moon moves into your financial zone. If your bank account is looking less than stellar, it’s a good day to get clear about your goals and make choices with confidence. Put on your thinking cap and cook up some creative ways to make extra cash. If you have a hidden talent you’ve been sitting on, bring it out of the closet. This could be an excellent time to start a new side hustle.","You can often get wrapped up in the concerns of other people and easily take on their energy, but you may find it easier to prioritize yourself thanks to the emotional Moon moving into your sign today. Take a moment to check in with yourself: What do you need that you have been denying yourself? How are you feeling about your relationships and circumstances? Spending time alone will help you center yourself and realign with your beliefs and faith in the bigger picture."
2021-03-12,"Change that we can feel good about is coming to lift our spirits, but we mustn't fall into delusions of grandeur. The sensitive Moon's sextile to changeable Uranus encourages us to turn a bad situation into something better, either personally or in the lives of others. When the Moon unites with balancing Venus in renewing Pisces at 10:29 pm EST, we should appreciate what we have and fix whatever needs a little tender loving care, rather than trading what we have now for the more shiny or exciting option.","It appears you are at the threshold of a new situation -- either romantic or financial -- that is unlike anything you've tried before. The details haven't quite been finalized, but this isn't a bad thing, so embrace your first steps instead of freezing at the starting line. You're learning to step out into uncertainty with the faith and optimism that you need to carry yourself through the unknown. Trust your intuition and enjoy the spiritual harmony as it soothes your soul.","Friendship makes the world go around and your own friendships are bringing you love and laughter under the current planetary energy. You will benefit from networking and making yourself into more of a social butterfly, even if you have to do so from home via the internet. Keeping your thoughts to yourself won't cut it now, because people are excited to connect and want to share their life developments with you. Being a good listener and an interesting storyteller will give you an emotional boost and improved confidence.","You have an opportunity to showcase a project that you've been putting your all into or giving a presentation on a subject that is close to your heart. Make an effort to face any nagging fears so that you can impress in your career and eradicate these doubts in your own mind, and in the minds of others. Rather than worrying about what could go wrong, give yourself the credit you deserve for working so hard while still being attentive to the people in your life.","Someone is trying to teach you their love language today. This doesn't have to be a romantic love -- it may be your love for friends or family -- but someone is likely to contact you suddenly or make a request they don't normally make. While it's fine to maintain boundaries if you have them with this person, there is a request for an act of kindness toward an individual in your life. Someday this kindness will return to you, but today, enjoy the giving process.","Shame is transformed into forgiveness today, with you either on the giving or receiving end of this forgiveness. Whether it was an embarrassing incident from the past that held you back from trying again or a negative mindset from your family, it’s time to make your own rules about what you can and can’t do. It’s even worth it to risk embarrassing yourself again, if that was the case, because the only people who never embarrass themselves are the ones who never try anything new.","New information about someone close to you has the power to change your own mind and approach. This is not negative, it’s more of a change to this person's beliefs or mindset and your reaction to it. We’re all developing our personalities every day with each new choice we make, and you have the ability to look at the lives of others and follow in their footsteps when they’re making good choices. It’s okay to be a little bit of a copycat, just give them credit for inspiring you!","Your natural instincts are empowered today. People who insist on doing things their way have influenced you for a long time, but you’re slowly reclaiming who you once were, and maybe even who you never got the chance to be. Take a step toward that acceptance, knowing that who you used to be and who you are now have different goals. Rebel against your old self -- as long as it isn’t malicious toward anyone -- and let a bit more of your true self shine.","Good times and great connections are on the agenda today. The special people in your life are reaching out in ways that they haven't before and the freshness of their presence is appealing. They may have changed somewhat since you last talked, but even if you’re not sure about the new them, make an effort to accept the choices that they’ve made and understand them for who they’ve evolved into. We all need a little acceptance sometimes.","Heartfelt conversations are in store for you with family members -- female family members in particular. These interactions may be unexpected, or perhaps they will have information for you that's out of the ordinary. Once you recover from the surprise, try and connect with these loved ones and be there for them if they need you. Chances are, they’re not sure about bringing this up to you and they’re hoping that you will be open to what they have to say.","You can experience a dose of positive energy from a new friend this morning, leading you to wonder how you can create more of these moments in your life. You want to see a change in your support system and in your friendships, yet if you expect the worst and say these expectations out loud, you’ll continue to get more of the same. Focus your thoughts and words on your desires instead of your fears and watch magic begin to happen.","The better your surroundings are now, the better connected you will be with your goals. So much of your stress is coming from where you spend most of your time and energy, and this saps your motivation for the other parts of your life. Instead of continuously trying to draw from a well that has been dried up, turn to new sources of inspiration and aesthetic beauty in order to replenish your creativity. Open the curtains and let the sunlight purify your space.","A heaviness is lifting and peace is flowing toward you. Enjoy the lighter vibes and spend some time with the people who supported you when you were struggling in the darkness. Be a good listener today, especially if you’re planning to change your look anytime soon -- good ideas are coming from your friends and you will be happy that you asked for their advice. Don’t let any criticisms from the people that you respect bring you down, though; instead, learn from what they’re saying."
2021-03-13,"Get ready to experience art, romance, and spirituality in its purest essence. It all begins when the gentle Moon joins imaginative Neptune in Pisces, drawing us away from harsh realities and letting our ideals guide our hearts. Then, the New Moon in Pisces at 5:21 am EST will help us to see our problems with the eyes of a child and approach them with a new perspective. Finally, purifying Venus' conjunction to Neptune helps us let go of our cynicism and experience the beauty the world has to offer.","All the problems of yesterday are beginning to melt away and you may be wondering what you were so concerned about in the first place! You’re in for a spiritual refresher, without really needing to make much of an effort on your part. If you’re able to let go of control over the direction of your day, you’ll be taken on a more leisurely path and have the opportunity to take in an artful experience. Visualize the life that you’re looking to live for the best results.","Your friends can be a source of true nourishment now -- they’re bringing you positivity and optimism in the form of words of reassurance, funny stories, small gifts, or acts of service. Instead of trying to be overly productive through this and focus on what you need to get done, let your friends take you on a little journey or spend time talking to them on the phone without a time limit. Your energy will be replenished once you’ve spent time connecting with loved ones.","By taking the path of least resistance in your career, everything may begin to bloom for you. It seems you’re beating your head against the wall trying to solve a problem or to complete a project, but getting nowhere and your frustration is mounting. Take a breather today and try to see this issue from a new perspective. Listen to some soothing music or take a long shower, then come back to the problem. Odds are, it will be no match for your refreshed brain.","This will be a highly spiritual day for you, where the material world has less to offer you than your inner world does. Open your mind and look into sacred practices that have been calling your name, like yoga or Tarot. Try something new and see if it resonates with your spirit, because this may be what you’ve been looking for in terms of a spiritually cleansing routine. Pay attention to how you feel and learn from your inner voice as it pushes you toward this higher purpose.","Dividends are being paid and you’re reaping the rewards for the work that you did when you didn’t have to. Wherever the need arises for you today, someone will be there to provide the assistance that you are looking for. This is all thanks to your kind and supportive actions toward others in the past, and even if you forgot about these times, they didn’t. You’re also likely to see returns on good investments that you made, so enjoy the harvest and keep finding new ways to give back.","Your relationships appear smooth now, so there’s no need to disrupt this calming energy with suspicion. Sometimes when people are being nicer to us than usual, we start to look for the negative side rather than accepting the gift of kindness. While it’s true that people will often sugarcoat their interactions with you if they’ve done something wrong, sometimes a gift is simply a gift. It’s not easy to remove that doubt, so let doubts exist without letting them take over your mind and enjoy the day anyway.","If there was ever a day for allowing yourself to indulge in self-care, this is it. Your routine appears less hectic as normal, and with some extra time, you can either sit around in nebulous restlessness or channel the beautifying energy of the day into your health routine. Pamper yourself and go the extra mile when it comes to your exercise and beauty habits. You’ll feel much better knowing you invested this time in yourself and are now set up for a better day tomorrow.","Your playful side is dying to be set free today as your 5th House of Fun is activated with pleasant energy. Imaginative excitement is on the table for you and you will feel like a kid again, even as you go about your work. Now is also a great time to spend with your children or the younger people in your life -- they can help you to open yourself up to this freedom of expression if you have been emotionally stuck.","It’s time to take a walk down memory lane, and it’s never looked so beautiful. Although not every memory is a pretty one, it seems like the good ones are all floating to the surface of your mind and helping you recall sweet times. A family member may also contact you and want to spend time talking about the past, and hearing each other's voices will put you in a cheerful mood. Find something positive about your past self that you’ve put aside and try incorporating in your current life.","While communication may not be very clear or fast, you’re receiving good news, and it’s okay if the details slowly trickle in as the day goes on. Impatience will only cause you problems -- you’re meant to stop and enjoy the roses as you’re provided with a slower pace and more chances to daydream. Paying attention to the world around you will give you a sense of peace, and that good news will make everything that felt so pressing yesterday seem less urgent.","Expect a little self-esteem boost today, either in your sense of self or in your wallet. You may be afraid of believing in a new, positive situation in your life, but those fears will begin to melt away as soon as you realize that you’ve put in the hard work and effort you needed to get the results you wanted. If your brain is constantly telling you that you could have done more and gotten more, remind yourself to appreciate before criticizing. Keep the focus on gratitude.","It’s your day to do what you want to do! More attention is coming your way, which can be unnerving as well as exciting. This shine is appearing in your social life, your romantic life, and in your career -- what to do with all this spotlight? There’s not much that you should do, other than embody your natural essence and do what comes naturally. Don’t be scared to speak up with your ideas and know that success can come easily, you just can’t fight it when it arrives."
2021-03-14,"Honesty, drive, and perseverance all combine to create a powerful emotional core within us that can weather anything. The emotional Moon's sextile to courageous Mars inspires us to be brave and truthful in all that we do, while her conjunction with wounded Chiron helps us to see what holds us back from giving our all. If we’re willing to look directly at our weaknesses with honesty, the Moon's sextile to disciplinary Saturn at 2:58 pm EDT will help us to build our foundation back a little stronger this time.","The place where you live is not your true home, because YOU are your true home. The body that you live in is where you will be for a long time, so why not love it with all your heart? Past and current struggles that were created by the opinions of others are ringing in your ears, but a ""boo"" is often louder than a cheer. Make the conscious effort to love yourself -- even the features that you may perceive as flaws. Don’t assist anyone in tearing you down.","There's magic within today. Spend some time nurturing your spiritual side and your deeper, hidden emotions, rather than spending all your time in the material world. You may be inclined to escape into your career or your financial endeavors instead of feeling your emotions and acknowledging them as they come. While physical security is important, it’s difficult to enjoy all your worldly rewards without spiritual and emotional security. Once you allow yourself to have this release, you’ll be ready to tackle the real world again.","It feels good to have others need you, but you must also realize that sometimes, they don't. Discord between friends or coworkers may cause you stress today, but don’t feel as if this is your battle to fight or your problem to solve. Step back and understand that some issues are really only between the people involved and that trying to change things from the outside isn’t worth it. Know your place in the situation and if you can’t mediate the issue quickly, let it go.","You may be feeling the need to control your own narrative today and keep everyone believing in a more perfect version of yourself that doesn’t exist, but where does this skewed standard for yourself come from? It’s okay if others know that you’re a flawed person, because they are all flawed, too. Using a perfect reputation as a suit of armor can only take you so far -- we all fall short of perfection in some way. Acknowledge your weaknesses and resolve to go easier on the mistakes of others.","You have things to do, places to be, and goals to achieve, so why are you sitting there and talking yourself out of it by creating mental scenarios where you fail? Negative self-talk is a quick route to a self-fulfilling prophecy that you don’t want to fulfill. Practice seeing yourself succeed before you take that first step, and congratulating yourself when you make it happen, rather than criticizing yourself when you fail. Look at the glass half full more often to see more success.","Others are seeing your success, but some of them didn’t see all the hard work that you had to do to achieve it. You may be noticing jealousy or derision in the crowd now, perhaps even in people who previously supported you. They’re disappointed with the shifting power dynamics in your relationships and may be trying to keep you from seeing your worth, or they're gloating about their own. Just know that only a bully needs to make someone feel lower than them in order to make themselves feel tall.","Balancing your own beliefs with the feelings of others is a very careful act where you must pick and choose your battles. Someone may be trying to sway you to their side, but they’re not doing a very impressive job and they’re turning you off of what they’re saying even more. It’s your choice to decide whether or not you’re willing to engage in this discussion and it’s okay if you tell them no or decide to simply walk away. Choose your own peace.","Past wounds from people that you thought were trustworthy may be resurfacing now, but this does not need to color your day in a negative way. Remind yourself that the past is the past and, while the memories may still be with you, the reality of the situation is behind you. If someone from this situation physically returns, then know that it’s okay to set boundaries that protect your progress on your journey of healing. You decide who is and is not a part of your life.","You may feel pushed by others today to give an opinion or take on something that’s happened, but rather than create and engage in gossip, resolve to be someone who doesn’t feel the need to inject their own point of view on matters that they aren’t a part of. Understand that your word is worth more when it really means something. Although people want to gossip now, they will trust you more in the future if you quietly maintain your integrity.","Someone or something in your life is asking for your commitment, but you’re not certain that this is where you truly belong. You’re trying to decide between feeling guilty that you haven’t already given an answer and feeling annoyed over the pressure that they’ve been putting on you. Try to understand what it is that’s been making you hold back without feeling guilty about the reason why. The best thing you can do now is be honest with yourself, and if you need more time, take it.","Communicating your true thoughts and feelings is important, but so is considering the feelings of others. This doesn’t mean that you should change your self-expression in order to make yourself smaller or more palatable for everyone around you, but that when someone is going through something difficult, they may not be able to handle your brutal honesty the way that you mean it. Try to provide your truth in softer words today if you know that there’s a crack in another's armor.","Distractions aplenty might throw you off your game today. It’s a struggle to concentrate with worries from yesterday or unexpected setbacks, but you can avoid getting frustrated by remaining flexible and understanding that setbacks are only there to protect you from where you’re not meant to be yet. Trust in divine timing to get you where you need to be. There’s no need to rush -- you are being given time to think more carefully about what you’re doing and build your focus for the future."
2021-03-15,"Our souls are energized today, giving us the ability to heal others and ourselves. An air of generosity takes the lead as the heartfelt Moon forms a cooperative sextile with bountiful Jupiter. Then, when Mercury finally enters Pisces at 6:26 pm EDT after a long stint in Aquarius, our thoughts and conversations turn to more emotional and spiritual matters. Finally, the Moon's square to destructive Pluto may inspire us to finally get rid of the negative habits and ideals that drain us of our energy.","Disruptions in your career may cause you to doubt yourself, but remember that you’ve already come this far when you didn’t have to. Your sense of self has evolved and you’re taking a more calculated approach than the instinctive one you were taking before. Although you’re trying to find peace, it seems as if the universe is throwing things at you just to see how you’ll react. No taking this as a sign that you should quit trying, though -- instead, strengthen your resolve and tackle it again tomorrow.","Emotions are coming to the surface unexpectedly, both good and bad. Why you’re feeling what you’re feeling may be a mystery to you, but this doesn’t mean you should try to brush it away in order to move past it. Take note of what brought up these feelings and acknowledge if they’re arising now because you had pushed them down before. Instead of backlogging more and more emotions, get them out into a journal or through creativity. Don’t be afraid of the way that you feel.","Your feelings or power could be in someone else's hands, but even if you want to share parts of yourself with them, you shouldn’t give them everything you are. You lose your autonomy this way and you put a burden on them that they either don’t or shouldn’t want. Even people in best friendships and committed partnerships should not lose themselves completely in another, because the person that you are is worthy even when you are apart. If someone is pressuring you to give over your power, be firm with your boundaries.","People who have seen you in a moment of weakness may be trying to use it against you now. Any rumors or snide comments made will show you who wants to see you succeed and who would rather see you fail. Have pity on these people but don’t feel the need to retaliate, because revenge won’t have any positive effect on your own life. Know that people only amplify the imperfections of others or create false stories when they have insecurities themselves. It's not you, it's them.","You’re learning how to better keep a secret, both for yourself and for others. If you’re someone who enjoys gossiping, you'd be wise to avoid it now to prevent yourself from ending up in an uncomfortable situation. You could be fed bad information in order to see what you will do with it, or you may receive a false story by accident that has the same embarrassing effect. Let others speak for themselves and leave yourself out of stories that you’re not a part of.","A promise is a promise -- don’t let what you feel like doing right now get in the way of the commitments that you’ve made. Although you may feel freer in the moment, you will regret letting someone down if you leave them in the dust. There are people willing to help you with your tasks if you ask for support and they can pick up some slack if you’ve been wearing yourself out lately, but you still need to show up and do your part.","Your family members may clash with your close friends or romantic partner today, and they will both look to you to see where you stand. The people that we love don’t always get along with each other, and we are left trying to maneuver around their animosity while we keep our relationships alive. While the desire to make everything okay for everyone may be strong, try to remain neutral unless someone is clearly in the wrong. Let them know that you still care about them both.","What you’re saying and what you’re doing should not be two different things. Your words and your actions may have been out of alignment lately, causing confusion and frustration for the people in your life, not to mention for you. You may even be doing this in order to try to impress someone that you care about, or you could be trying to pretend to be someone that you’re not for the sake of peace. Take off the mask and let your authentic self breathe again.","An overabundance of security will keep you from having fun and taking risks. You may be focused on the appealing material effects of working long and hard hours, but what is this worth if you’re exhausted all the time and unable to enjoy the fruits of your labor? It may be time to rearrange your priorities so that you’re finding time to have fun, rather than going through the repetitive motions of working, eating, and sleeping. There's so much more to life.","Revelations about yourself may lead to a change of heart that you weren’t expecting. This revelation could come from a comment from a friend or sibling that opens your eyes to something about you that you were unaware of. Now that you know the effect that you have on others and the ways that you’ve made people feel, you can use this information to guide your future steps. Knowing yourself is the fastest way to become the best version of yourself.","Your mind is on security and making plans for the future, but reality is throwing some curveballs at you in the form of hypercriticism or worry. You’re also more likely to communicate your deeper thoughts and feelings to others now, so this may be one of those times where you put your foot in your mouth by worrying out loud. Don’t create unnecessary tension by questioning people’s motives or trying to control their actions before they’ve even done anything. Peace comes when you live and let live.","You may feel knocked off balance today by unexpected requests or explosive actions from your social circle, your coworkers, or another group that you belong to. If someone goes too far with their words or actions, it’s better to let it go in the moment and return to it later with a calmer attitude. Think about how you can best handle the situation before you try to handle it, and know that you’re better equipped to talk about this after you’ve been given some time."
2021-03-16,"Even positive upheaval can be frustrating, but we can feel relief coming. While the Moon's entry into Taurus is normally stable, today it creates abundance in our lives through more intense measures. The vibrant Sun's sextile to transformational Pluto at 2:26 pm EDT gives us the inner and outer resolve to change our less-than-desirable situations, but it may be a messy change. Once the Moon joins nervous Uranus, it's up to us to harness the unpredictability and be a calming presence when others' emotions are running away with them.","You feel compelled to solve problems today, but your efforts might cause more chaos than they solve. If you’re trying to jump into something without knowing all the facts, or you’re realistically unprepared, then it’s okay to take a backseat and allow others who understand the situation to take care of it. Sometimes your role is a background one, not to undermine your success, but to give you a break from the pressure. Make no promises that you can’t keep and have no worries about what you can’t change.","Expect to have a change of heart and some impulsive urges to come your way today. You’re still learning how to say ""yes"" to your intuition and ""no"" to what isn’t for you, and it’s okay if you haven’t figured out exactly what you’re supposed to be doing. None of us have it figured out completely, and your friends will support you even if you’re not exactly the same person you were yesterday. Embrace shedding your old skin -- it doesn't fit you anymore.","Your career is beginning to take off, but you may be worried that you won’t be able to create the future you want based on where you are now. Rome wasn’t built in a day and your big goals won’t be either. Take each step as if it were important, even if it seems small. The trust that you’re building with new connections and the shine that you’re receiving is not for nothing. Be present, not anxious, because you’ll think back on this time with fond memories when you’re more established.","Friends come and go, but your relationship with yourself is forever. You may be mourning the loss of a friendship or excited over receiving a new ally, but either way, you’re seeing shifts in your circle. However, make sure that you’re not changing yourself for the people around you and becoming disconnected with your inner guide. Commit to being more authentic and you will attract friends who will like you for who you are, rather than trying to impress them with a personality tailored to them.","Emotions are running high when it comes to your career. A sudden change to the work dynamic today might cause you to feel unstable while you’re trying to get things done, but roll with the punches and let it be the rollercoaster that it’s trying to be. This will give you a better sense of how you react when everything is not going according to plan in regards to your major professional steps. You’ll also be better prepared when life throws you a curveball in the future.","We all need somebody to lean on and there’s no shame in asking for a little guidance. It’s advice that you need now, so however it appears, don’t be too proud to accept it. It’s easier for you to jump to conclusions under the current planetary energy and you might not be seeing things clearly while you’re making decisions. If someone you can normally trust to be level-headed is telling you that you’re blowing things out of proportion, trust them and wait until tomorrow to make your choice.","You’re full of energy and power today, you just need to have the right mindset in order to use this to its full advantage. Your biggest roadblock right now is yourself, with procrastination and doubt preventing you from fully stepping into your power and taking on a bigger role. As long as you’ve prepared, there’s no reason that you should think you’re any less capable than anyone else. Use the beginning of the day to boost yourself up emotionally in the mirror, then carry that empowerment with you.","Someone hasn’t responded to you in the way you were expecting them to, and now you’re thrown off when it comes to your optimism and confidence. We can’t control the actions of others just like they can’t control us, and with that knowledge, it’s always a risk to put yourself out there and tell someone how you feel. If you feel rejected or unheard, try to distract yourself until you have some space from the moment. You’ll soon realize that it was not personal.","Your routine is full of distractions and detours today, so be prepared to come to a stop at certain points. Patience and mental presence are your friends, because railing against the frustration will only create more frustration. Remember, you’ll still have everything done at the end of the day, so there’s no reason to be reckless while you’re trying to finish your to-do list. If you need some help staying calm, lean on your family members or the people you live with to keep you focused.","A curveball may be thrown your way today when a younger person in your life asks you something you’re unprepared to answer. Still, try to respond with grace and honesty -- your words can transform a conversation of uncertainty or negativity into something positive. Lend your life experience to someone who isn’t as experienced as you and you will both feel a sense of fulfillment. Don’t try and make it seem as if you were better prepared -- they'll appreciate you just being honest about what you’ve been through.","Your feelings toward your roots are changing and you are looking to create more security in your present life. You know that it’s time to move on from what you’ve always thought or done, but stubbornness keeps you doing the same things you were doing last year. Remember that you must change on the inside -- you must reinvent yourself and your words and actions before you will see change coming from the outside. Let your intuition guide you toward the person you want to become, not who you’ve been before.","Constant overthinking or projecting can lead you to cut yourself down before you’ve even begun something, but this nervous way of thinking is trying to form a wall between you and your personal success. If your thoughts are erratic now then your communication will be erratic as well, and people will be confused by your motives if you’re letting this nervousness make your decisions. The more confident and relaxed you can be today, the better for everyone involved."
2021-03-17,"It is a fairly quiet day astrologically and the boredom may turn into loneliness if we don’t find ways to occupy our minds. The emotional Moon's difficult square with isolating Saturn can cause us to feel cut off from others or even ourselves, and we are more likely to let negativity creep in if we aren’t vigilant. Let’s remember that this lonely feeling will pass, that we will be with people who love us again, and that we are capable of overcoming any emotional obstacle set before us.","Insecurity is trying to sneak into your life today but you have the strength to keep it at bay. Instead of getting down on yourself about what you didn’t do right or where you’ve let people down, try to focus on what you can do to make things right, or how you can set yourself up for success in the future. We are all on a learning curve when it comes to life, and you must see what you can do now rather than remain worrying about the past.","You may be extra sensitive to the criticism or advice of others now when it comes to your career or reputation. Someone has a lot to say about what you can and cannot do, and you may even be tempted to agree with them dismissing your accomplishments. Why help them tear you down when you could be building yourself back up better and stronger this time? Let this person know that you’re aware of yourself and you will take their words into consideration, but make your own decisions.","You're wearing the opposite of rose-colored glasses and things seem more annoying than usual, but it may be something else that’s tinting your day in this dismal way. If you’ve been avoiding something large that you know you need to deal with or you’re still trying to heal from a difficult event, then try to resist projecting this negativity onto other areas of your life that don’t deserve it. Be honest with yourself about where these feelings are coming from and keep them there.","Feelings of isolation may intensify today, but you are no stranger to being in solitude and tend to pop out with something impressive after your hiatus. This is an optimal day to spend some time alone, working on yourself and your personal projects in peace. Avoid signing contracts or making long-term commitments, though, especially if you have a gut feeling that tells you that you need more time. Allow yourself whatever space your mind and heart are calling for.","Who you are at work and who you are around your loved ones may come into conflict. Make sure that you’re leaving work problems at work when you come home and not taking your residual frustrations out on the people who love you. Even if it seems like they’re not willing to help or support you, it’s likely that they’re going through their own struggles right now rather than trying to slight you. Err on the side of kindness and understanding.","People are pressuring you to do more than you realistically can, but you’re tired of going through the motions when they keep leading to exhaustion. As responsible as you are, you’re not responsible for everything that everyone tries to give you, and you certainly can’t do it all alone. Hard work and tenacity are wonderful things, but if you find that you’re overdoing it and trying to do the work of three people, it might be time to look for another pair of hands to help you.","There's a battle happening today between your self-doubt and self-confidence, and events from the past may be holding you back from fully trusting your feelings. Although criticism from some younger people in your life or your romantic partner may cause you to second guess yourself, how you respond depends on the truth of the matter between you. The best course of action is to calmly absorb what they’ve said, then determine whether you must apologize for what you’ve done or stand your ground and defend your actions.","You may be torn today between your family and someone that you’re involved with who are now at odds. You love them both, but they are in conflict. If this is not the case, then you may have an internal rift about a relationship that you’re in, wondering whether you should stay or go. Either way, you have a choice to make today and it should not be taken lightly. It’s okay to stand back and try not to get involved, but if you do get involved, be kind.","It’s hard to get a move on now, so take your time. Nervous action and getting in a hurry can lead you to take two steps forward, but three steps back, whereas a steady mental focus and a maintainable pace will get you to the finish line with minor hiccups. It will take more brain power than usual to get your thoughts in gear, but doing a meditation on your plan for the day or making a list and setting reminders may help you to think without so much static.","Responsibility is blocking your road to fun, but procrastination is your real enemy. What you put off yesterday to be done today is now getting in the way of what you needed to do today, and you have double the work! If you don’t have more on your plate than normal, then your work still may take more time than you were anticipating, so try to get a jump on things early to prevent missing out on activities that you’re looking forward to.","People are providing you with support and encouragement, but you may not be willing to hear what they have to say. Why are you committed to thinking that you’re capable of less than you are? If you look back, you can see all that you’ve overcome to get to this point, but you’re arguing with the people who love you, causing you both frustration. Try to give yourself the credit that you deserve and don’t mentally remain in old crowds that didn’t understand you. These people do.","Projecting your fears is a surefire way to stall your progress. You may be afraid of starting a new endeavor so you’ve been talking yourself out of it mentally, but your heart keeps bringing you back to it. Don't allow fear to hijack your thought process. Try to be present today and pay attention to what’s going on immediately, rather than worrying about ten years into the future or trying to figure out all the possible things that could go wrong. Life is happening now, be in the moment!"
2021-03-18,"We are taken for an emotional ride as the sensitive Moon forms five angles to other planets today, so let’s sit with our feelings before we act on them. Sensuous Venus' sextile to intense Pluto strengthens our senses of passion, yet we don’t know which way is up because we’re so caught up in the magnetic energy of the moment. Once the Moon enters Gemini at 7:47 pm EDT, we’ll be ready to process all the feelings that have gone through us and express them with the right words.","Blessings are coming to you, but you may not have the space to receive them. You have so much going on right now, creating chaos in your life and closing you off from exploration and opportunity. When your entire world is on a schedule every moment of every day, it can be difficult to receive the gifts the universe is sending you. Go out of your way to spend time in nature or in solitude today and let the healing power of gratitude and silence open new avenues for you.","Standing up for what you believe in is sometimes easier said than done. The universe is supporting you in sticking to your convictions and telling people what you really want, but you still have to take the first steps. Even if your voice shakes, say what you have on your mind and in your heart -- people are willing to listen. Otherwise, you may spend a lot of time wondering what would have happened if you had spoken up.","Your professional journey is highlighted today and this is a great time to brainstorm new marketing strategies or update your resumé. Reach out to others and voice your needs, because there's a lot of support for you today. Pay close attention to financial advice that you receive, and if someone brings you information about their new job that intrigues you, follow up on this connection. You’ll also have more available when looking for monetary support for your business, but remember, no one knows what you need unless you ask.","All of your emotional relationships are intensified today, but while this is good news for close friendships and romantic partnerships, this also means that any tense or troublesome connections will be more noticeable on your radar. Instead of feeding into any negativity, try to limit your interactions with people who don’t mean you well or who have hurt you in the past. Use your emotions and energy for good and go all in with those who support you.","Letting the day speed by and take its own course won't end with you feeling accomplished or fulfilled. It’s time to get back on track and set a schedule, and thankfully, starting new habits like this is easier now. Meanwhile, you may find yourself slipping into jealous feelings, but it's possible to turn jealousy into something positive and motivating. Visualize yourself where you want to be, without needing to take from someone else, and open yourself to the coming opportunities that will transport you there.","Charming and intriguing people are coming into your life and you will find new inspiration and motivation through hearing about their experiences. Although this might lead you to feel a fear of missing out -- or a fear that you’ve already missed out -- this will fade and you will realize that there’s so much more life for you to live. Your sense of humor and your passion are both boosted today, and you could turn a new friendship into a lifelong connection.","Your time of regeneration and renewal has arrived. You’re ready to clean up your act when it comes to your physical health as well as your family’s health, and you have a lot of support now. But true wellness is more than just diet and exercise, it's also about your mood. A messy environment can cause you to feel stifled or unmotivated, and now is an excellent time to freshen up the energy of your home and revitalize your surroundings so that you can breathe easier.","Your words have more weight today and you have a commanding presence, so those who respect you will take what you say to heart. Don’t waste the power that you have now by using it to shut someone down when they’re trying to share their experiences, even if they don't live up to your ideals. However, if you see someone who can’t speak up for themselves, step in and use your voice to be in solidarity with them. Be a defender, not an attacker.","The support and security you're receiving from your family now is encouraging you to dream bigger about your home and family's future. Where and how do you want to spend your time in the long run? You may find yourself buying decor to refresh your living space, or on a grander scale, searching for new homes online. It’s a good time for apartment or house hunting, but not great for closing the deal, so sleep on it before coming to a final decision as big as this.","People keep noticing that there’s something different about you, but is there? Whether you have a new haircut, a new wardrobe, or just a new attitude, you’re certainly making an impression. Expect to receive many different opinions from others today, but remind yourself that the only opinion that really matters when it comes to your appearance and how you carry yourself is your own. You might not want to go overboard with daring choices, but if it makes you happy, then embrace it!","Life is for living, not for hiding from what scares you. Things that are long past are resurfacing now to show you how far you’ve come. Remember that you were once intimidated to take on something that you conquered in the past, whether it was school or your first job or your first home. This serves as a marker for you to remember that you can conquer anything, even the things that you’re still in the middle of conquering. All you have to do is persevere.","A goal of yours is starting to lose its luster and you must decide whether to let it fall to the wayside or try to reinject some life into it. It's possible that you've evolved away from this ambition, so if trying to hang onto it isn’t fitting in with where your life is now, that’s okay. You can even mourn this goal as you lay it to rest, but you will see more success once you center your focus."
2021-03-19,"Healthy debates can ultimately bring about the positive change we need. The gentle Moon's harsh square to communicative Mercury may cause us to butt heads verbally, but it can also raise questions that need to be asked. The Moon's later conjunction with passionate Mars only adds fuel to the fire, so impatience and aggression will need to be reined in. When Luna finally forms a harmonious trine to disciplinary Saturn, though, we can see our differences from a more mature standpoint, if we’re willing to look.","You’re quick with your words today, but not as quick with your thoughts. Say what you need to say, but take time to think first or else your mouth may get you in trouble -- impatience is your greatest enemy right now. Deep down, you know that you’re not trying to hurt anyone in the process of speaking your truth, so be careful and intentional in your delivery. Don't let the blunt impact of what you’re saying get in the way of your message.","Strangely enough, you’ll find yourself having an easier time tending to your responsibilities today than you will relaxing. Although it seems paradoxical, you will find your leisure time being interrupted by unwanted guests or other kinds of nuisances, while your work is more fulfilling and serene than it normally is. Things will get back to their usual ways and you'll have plenty of opportunity for downtime, so for now, lean into your work and see if the results don’t impress you.","Diligent focus is needed or else your thoughts could run away with you. Delays and distractions are likely, so you will need to put in more effort to make this day go according to plan. Take your time and don’t get in a hurry, because you’re more easily frustrated by setbacks or personal mistakes now. Meditation can be a great help to you, or even a few moments of focused breathing where you can clear your mind and reorient yourself. Eliminate the distractions and you’ll move forward much faster.","Your fears and uncertainties are acting up today, but remind yourself that there’s only so much that you can hide from or prepare for. You take risks every day that you take for granted, and if you’re being honest with yourself, you’ve handled much worse than the scenarios that your brain is creating for you right now. Let someone who has known you for a long time remind you of what you’re capable of. Your own doubts might be all that’s in your way!","Passions erupt within your circle, possibly among a few people. Even if you’re not directly involved, there’s heat in the emotional exchanges between those close to you and you’re stuck in the crossfire. Avoid being nosy or trying to find gossip, because what you find might be more than you bargained for. As you go about your day, keep your eyes on your own business and make sure that any disputes that others do have with you are handled maturely.","You’ve been working long and hard hours, and now the time has come to take care of your physical health by taking a break. If you’ve been prioritizing the bottom line over your body, you may need to slow down on how much time you devote to socializing and activity today. After finishing the work that you’re responsible for, schedule some time out to tend to yourself and rest. A good meal, a relaxing soak, and a solid sleep can work wonders.","You are especially intense in your beliefs and morals now, which is a good thing if it helps you to help others. Standing up to bullies is noble, but make sure that you’re not just getting up in people’s faces to yell about what you feel is right. Read the room, and if your speech is not being received how you want it to or if you're not convincing anyone that you’re right, it might be time to rework the approach.","There's tension at home today and you'll need to reach a compromise in order to get back to harmony. Either you or a family member may have been disappointed by a loved one, but in reality, their actions were likely not intentional. Try and be forgiving and encourage others to forgive, too, but remember what has happened and learn from it. This is probably not something that you want to throw away a relationship over, so working it out is your best course of action.","Other people's attitudes could drive you up the wall today and you may not feel like communicating with everyone like usual. You might want to spend time with just one or two people after work is over -- it will be relaxing to work on projects or take in a movie in your home without much input from others. However, you can also be a bit more critical of others now, so be sure to soften your words if you’re trying to get people on your side.","Your career and financial situation seem to be picking up, but you might still feel like you haven’t done enough. You may be getting down on yourself for what you still haven’t achieved, but don’t be your own worst enemy. Look at where you are right now as a benchmark -- even when you’ve made more progress in the future, you will likely feel much the same, yet you'll have come so far. Measure yourself against your past self, not other people.","Discipline and honesty are what you need to succeed now, even though it’s tempting to exaggerate for dramatic effect. Something surprising is likely to happen right in front of you, or you may receive an extra enticing piece of gossip, but try to keep things at a happy medium and avoid rocking the boat. That is, unless you’re determined to cause a ruckus! If you do, just make sure that you’re creating this change for the right reasons and not for selfish motives.","You and your family members or other people you live with aren’t seeing eye to eye, and it is causing some tension. You can’t change your mind and they can’t change their feelings, but both of you feel like you’re in the right. Eventually, you must come to a compromise and let bygones be bygones, or else you will have to deal with bad energy in the home. Try not to go to bed angry and let each other know you’re coming from a place of love."
2021-03-20,"Welcome to a new beginning. The Sun enters vibrant Aries at 5:37 am EDT, marking the Spring Equinox and bringing the Sun back to the first point in the zodiac wheel. A physical and mental spring cleaning will allow us to make the most of this refreshing time. The sensitive Moon's trine with expansive Jupiter gives us the optimism we need to spruce up our lives, yet her square to nebulous Neptune may distract us from reality. It’s a good time for planning, but a bad time for committing.","Your time has arrived! It’s the first day of Aries season, and the outside world feels more supportive and responsive to you than it normally does. The people who care about you will have wisdom and generosity to give to you, as you may be struggling with self-doubt or restrictions that you impose on yourself. Shake off the cobwebs and let bygones be bygones. You owe it to yourself to step out of your own way and listen to the people who are giving you a pep talk.","Good things are happening, but even rewards can be overwhelming, so you will need to be rested to take on the blessings that come your way. You will see hard work and discipline paying off for you, most likely from your past work rather than current work. Let yourself reap the rewards and accept praise with grace. While the vibes are positive and your finances and career are blooming, there’s much to do and many people to talk to, so make sure to keep your energy up.","Travel and mental expansion are supported today, but make sure you don’t check out a day too early! Distractions or miscommunications are likely to come up with work, so get all your business squared away before you sail off into the sunset. You’re ready to follow your heart and have some fun, and there’s no problem with that! Don’t overcommit to others, and spend your time doing what really sounds fun to you. It’s time you chose to follow what's calling to you.","Financial support and dependable connections are coming your way to support your professional endeavors. Now is a great time to make some upgrades to your business or to revamp your resume for an exciting opportunity you've heard about. However, it’s not a good time to finalize projects or sign contracts making anything official. Creating goodwill with people who can help you in your career is favorable, and even if you can’t see forward progress being made right now, all your work should feel easier than normal.","Your relationships with others are highlighted today, for better or for worse. Your current relationships appear to be smooth, supportive, and lighthearted, yet important people who drifted from you due to past transgressions may be returning now and seeking forgiveness. It is up to you whether or not you are willing to accept and forgive; ask yourself if your life is more full or more peaceful without them, and if it’s worth it to disrupt what you’ve since cultivated.","The good news is your routine and work appear smooth and you’re seeing progress in your current projects. At the same time, your relationships with heartfelt lovers or even bitter enemies feel unclear, and you may not be sure where you stand. Trust and morality are highlighted for you now, and anyone you can’t depend on will need to take a backseat in your life. Take some time alone today and spend your energy identifying your needs and investing in you.","Learning through others and seeing fresh sights will invigorate you today, so be open to what people bring to you, especially when it comes to entertainment and new experiences. You might have educational encounters with younger people, or you could embrace your inner child and participate in a fun activity that you haven’t engaged in since your younger years. Don’t judge yourself, because the more fun you have and share with others, the more beneficial the day will be.","You’re in the process of healing from old wounds, and today, the universe is making it a little easier. If you’ve been dealing with an illness, with grief, or just feeling meh, engage in self-care and enjoy the warmth of your bed or a long, soothing bath. There’s no need to push yourself to entertain others, because you can’t pour from an empty cup; you will be better able to take on life after you’ve refreshed yourself. Be kind to your body and mind.","Your world is expanding and new and creative situations are entering your life. If you’ve been feeling stifled, you’ll now begin to feel those shackles breaking off of you. Studying something that interests you -- especially with a close friend or loved one -- is a great way to spend this time, as is leaving behind the people and perspectives that hold you back from enjoying your life. Your mindset is opening up now, so make sure that you’re putting what you want in there!","All roads are closed, except for the one you’ve been on for a while now. Stick with what you know, because branching out is likely to end in disappointment if you start something now. Spending time with the friends who have been by your side for a long time and the family that you’ve been able to depend on will bring you support and comfort. Acquaintances or strangers may try to take advantage of you if you are too trusting, so stick to your roots.","Foundations are being shaken, so hold on tight or risk taking a step backward. Optimism is running high for you and the people in your life, but make sure that this eager attitude doesn’t take you too far outside your comfort zone. Communication and travel are far more favorable now than spending money on material possessions or extravagant meals. Spending time in nature on a hike or another physical activity can help you to feel fulfilled, while retail therapy might end in regret.","You’re feeling secure when it comes to your accomplishments and possessions, but you seem to be less secure now in your raw self, your personality, and your unique ideas. Others are trying to spend time with the inner you, though, regardless of what you’ve been able to achieve materially. Remember your inherent self-worth, separate from any awards or important titles that you possess, and you’ll enjoy much easier relations with others. Relax and be yourself, because that’s who your real friends want to be with."
2021-03-21,"We’re seeing new blooms when it comes to love, innovation, and courage. Right on the heels of the Sun, romantic Venus moves into brave Aries today, and relationships that were once unclear are becoming starkly obvious and honest. Communicative Mercury's sextile to shocking Uranus will allow us to say and do what is needed, even if it’s really out there and not what we’re used to. Finally, motivated Mars' trine to structured Saturn meshes courage with realism to help us take concrete steps toward our goals.","Your relations become easier and you'll enjoy friendlier interactions with the world now that Venus is entering your sign today. Courageous conversations and positive changes in your self-esteem are helping you to be more confident in yourself in public spaces, in ways that you may have felt scared to be before. Others will appreciate you more and take more notice of you now, including in the career sector. Try to let your actions speak for themselves and use your words to lift up the people around you.","You’re receiving support and guidance now, from both your subconscious and from the people around you. In order to understand the guidance that's coming from your subconscious, pay attention to your dreams and write down their themes. If you can’t remember your dreams when you wake up, write down how you felt when you awoke and the thoughts that were on your mind. Meanwhile, others are offering support by connecting you with opportunities and helping the wheels of your life turn more swiftly. Go with this beneficial flow.","Someone in your life is looking for help and, today, they may come to you for assistance. Be willing to lend a helping hand, especially if it is someone who has been there for you in the past. You’re being supported in your energy and your health right now, but others may not have this privilege, so what may not be very difficult for you could be monumental for them. Do what you can for others today, even if it doesn’t seem like very much. It really is the thought that counts.","Your career is highly supported at this time and you could see money flowing in without much need for effort on your part. Today's combination of planetary energies is helping you to fulfill your professional and financial goals; new people are entering your community that will either make your work easier by taking it off your hands, or help it to go by faster through their efforts. If you have work projects that you’ve been stuck on, this is a good day to plow through the roadblocks.","You’re starting the process of moving on and maturing, and this is happening not a moment too soon. It will be easier to be brave about setting boundaries and to do your own thing, as you may not feel the desire to spend as much time with someone close like your significant other or best friend. You’re realizing that you’re your own person and that you don’t need someone to walk with you every step of the way. Let the new you walk a little more independently.","Investments from the past are paying off, while current projects are just getting started. You’re working incredibly hard, and you’re finally seeing the results and dividends in abundance. You’re also better at communicating with others now, and more willing to compromise, as long as the other person is willing to work with you. Mindsets are changing and you aren’t walking alone as much as you have been, so be open to the people who are trying to work with you.","Relationships of all forms are pleasant and easygoing today. You’ll enjoy the company of others more, and you’ll probably find that things that used to bother you aren’t as jarring. Just don’t let negative people use your free-spiritedness to slip back into your life and restart old cycles that you consciously stopped in the past, or else you’ll quickly be back where you once were. Shine your positive attitude onto the people who care about you and you’ll end up in a better place.","Shifting loyalties and changing priorities are working in your favor and can help you realize who is on your side and who is secretly campaigning for your failure. You’re continuing to benefit from investing in yourself, rather than putting your needs on the back burner or defending yourself to people who are supposed to be supporting you. Your career is blooming and your mind is working quickly to accommodate your success. You’re outwardly charming and witty now, so use this to your advantage when marketing yourself.","The difficult blockades standing in the way of your fun and creativity are melting away under today's fresh, positive light. Others are taking more notice of you now, and exciting connections could become especially passionate. You may have been wondering when the sunshine would return, but it’s finally back and you’ll be able to enjoy the activities again that you set aside a while ago. The more fun you allow yourself to have, the better the day will go.","Relationships with family members feel easier than ever, and anyone who has been blocking your communications may finally speak back up. Take advantage of this better flow of conversation and let others speak their piece, but feel free to speak yours as well. If you find that old grudges can’t be resolved, then do your best to find closure and move forward. If the other person is willing to work with you, then you can decide where to go from there with kindness. Let your security come from within.","Creativity and genuine communication are coming together in a positive way to uplift and inspire you. The hard work that you’ve put into your own life and into your closest relationships is returning to you in the form of emotional support now, and any positivity that you send out today will set up even more goodwill. Your mind is set on harmony and your ambition is geared toward celebration and creative expression; enjoy this rewarding moment!","Your inner compass is guiding you toward people who make you feel secure and opportunities that allow you to build a better foundation for yourself. You may find yourself communicating a bit differently than normal, but this is a good thing! Others will appreciate your fresh point of view, as long as you don't dominate the conversation with your rapid thought process. Make plans for the future now, while you have clear access to such an innovative mindset."
2021-03-22,"Our eyes are opening so that we can see past the box that we’re inside of. The introspective Moon's sextile to offbeat Uranus opens us up to methods that we may have thought to be too drastic or strange before, and gives us the chance to try what hasn’t been tried yet. The Moon's trine to perceptive Mercury at 1:46 am EDT adds another helpful layer to our brainstorming, giving us mental clarity and speeding up our thought process to match the wave of new ideas flooding in.","Your focus is on your home and family now, and they may present you with a brand-new way of doing things that you didn’t expect from them, which can bring you more security. It’s okay to voice your true thoughts, because you are meant to use this time to heal and find a way to make life easier for yourself, as well as the people you live with. A small opportunity to improve your cash flow or help you save money may also arise, so be on the lookout.","There are people to see and places to be today, and there are a whole lot of them! Everything is moving at a breakneck pace, so keep your mind open and write down any eureka moments that you have. You may be a bit reckless right now, but you can channel this intense energy into something positive by working on projects that you’ve been putting off for a long time or starting a new, good habit. Don't let boredom put you in a tailspin; take control of your vision.","Out with the bad energy and in with the good! Stale surroundings won’t do now and messy environments will drain you of your energy. Take time today to freshen up your space and create an area where you feel comfortable and separate from work. Your phone or computer may have been causing you anxiety lately, so see if taking a short break from technology and work projects helps you to think more clearly. Even if looking at emails or texts is tempting, make yourself unplug for a moment.","Freedom triumphs today and you are able to be true to yourself and to the world. The people around you are being more honest with themselves now, which gives you the space to debut new aspects of yourself and be vulnerable. Let others know who you are so that they have a chance to connect with the real you, and allow people to inspire you through their own uniqueness. Be a good listener as well, because what you learn today will lift your spirits.","Expect opinions to change about you today, but for the better. Someone may have spread some positive chatter about you that is getting around, or perhaps you're receiving good news related to a job that you applied for a while ago. The point is, nice things that were done or said in secret are bringing blessings for you now, and while you may not know exactly how you feel about all the surprise attention, you’re sure to handle it with grace. Take in this goodness that you deserve!","Opportunities to explore through learning and travel are being brought to you by others now, and you’re ready to indulge yourself in the adventure. A monotonous routine is likely dragging you down, so you need something to refresh you mentally and physically. Spend some time out in nature with someone you're close with and enjoy breathing the fresh air. It’s time to put down that schedule for a moment and reconnect with what gives you life.","Your current ambitions may be taking you toward your ultimate goals, but it's also possible you've veered off track and have gotten caught in a loop of drudge work. If you feel fulfilled and excited by your work now, then take it as a sign that you are where you’re supposed to be and you’re moving forward on the right path. However, if you feel especially frustrated by your career and your direction today, then it’s time to revise your resume. A change will do you good.","Being tied down is not an option for you right now, and any controlling commitment will cause you to feel out of alignment. No one is meant to spend every moment of their life conforming to a schedule, especially in their close relationships. Break out of the boring ruts that you’re stuck in with your partner or your friends and introduce some fun into the situation. Play a new game together or make a new recipe, just make sure it’s something you haven’t done before!","It appears there is someone in your life who wants to spend more time with you, but they are not willing to ask you and would rather you come to this conclusion on your own. Turn the focus off of yourself for a moment and pay attention to the close relationships in your life, especially family. While it’s not up to you to read other people’s minds, ask yourself who you haven’t heard from in a long time and who might want to hear your voice.","Someone very close to you is looking for some quality time with you, but they’re not looking for the same old conversations and activities. This person may initiate a heart-to-heart talk or simply have a lot of gossip to share, but whatever the story is, you can expect active and wide-spanning communication to be an important focus for you today. Be open to talking about everything under the sun, rather than continuing to hold in what you’ve been thinking and feeling.","Your surroundings are shifting, but you’ve got it all under control. You have the opportunity to be extra productive and handle your business with ease now; it feels as if all the gears of your life are turning smoothly. New and interesting people with fresh stories and facts will help the time go by quickly -- you just wish there were more hours in the day so that you could keep riding this wave of stamina and speed. Do what you can, but don’t burn yourself out!","Your surroundings are shifting, but you’ve got it all under control.

2021-03-23,"Creation and destruction are working in harmony. The sensitive Moon's early trine to spiritual Neptune asks us to think not only with our mind, but also with our heart. Then, the Moon's opposition to transformational Pluto can cause us to break down our emotional walls in order to open up and be truly vulnerable. When the Moon enters confident Leo at 5:56 pm EDT, we become more sure of ourselves and ready to face new challenges, which will come when swift Mercury squares off with explosive Mars tonight.","Feelings that you’ve been holding inside are coming to the surface and it’s important to find a healthy channel for these erupting emotions. You’re more likely to be dramatic with your feelings now, as they’re amplified by hesitations or doubts that are playing with your mind. Don’t let these inner conflicts force your feelings out in a manner that you wouldn’t want them displayed. Writing out your thoughts in a journal or directing emotions into exercise will help you to be at peace.","You are left to your own devices today as your friends are a bit distant or busy with other aspects of their life. While you may feel like sticking to just one idea, activity, one person, don’t let this one-track mind steal the day from you! Balance is key to succeeding now, because you are likely to become obsessive about whatever you are devoting your attention to, losing track of all else. Set reminders for yourself if you need them to help break your laser focus from time to time.","You can’t seem to get any straight answers from your place of work, and it could be driving you to frustration. People are likely to test your patience today, especially on the job, and you will need to take some deep breaths in order to get through it. Make sure that you have someone to vent to after work is over and lend them a listening ear if they’ve had a stressful day as well. Sometimes you just need to let it out.","Situations arise today that cause you to rethink working with other people. If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself, right? In this case, you may actually be overestimating what you can do on your own. Even if the help isn’t the help that you were desiring, sometimes compromise and working with someone that you don’t mesh with is your only option. Try to express gratitude for who you have with you and find some common ground.","Power dynamics are difficult to navigate right now, and people that are normally hard to frustrate may be slipping into a negative attitude. Now is not a good time to try and assert yourself or climb the corporate ladder, as it’s likely to be met with a firm ""no"" from your superiors who are already in a bad mood. With the emotional explosivity present today, it’s best to play in the background and let others battle it out if they choose to.","It’s hard to get a firm ""yes"" or a ""no"" from someone you truly care about today, and their elusiveness might be causing you to worry about your security within the relationship. Even platonic relationships are feeling the heat, and you’re questioning whether or not you were too bold, too indecisive, too aloof, etc. Instead of trying too hard to analyze the situation, give yourself a break and let the other person have their space. Hashing things out now is likely to end in confusion anyway!","Delays and distractions are liable to throw you off your groove if you don’t have a plan in front of you. However, you can find success now if you’re able to make a list and keep up with it. Your work life may be trying to overtake your home life, so force them apart if you have to. There has to be a clear line drawn so that you’re able to rest mentally, or else you’ll end up spreading yourself too thin. Then, nobody wins.","Somebody is pushing you for a response, but they won't like what you have to say if they push you too far. While it’s tempting to answer in a way that cuts them down, it’s more beneficial for you to be the bigger person and not allow them to get to you. Watch what you say under the influence of irritation, or you’re likely to wish that you had kept your mouth shut. Respond with patience and clear boundaries and this person will quickly figure it out.","Your feelings are hard to put your finger on today, and your financial security could be a little shaky, too. Avoid emotional spending if you find yourself in a funk, because this could be what leads to the financial shakiness; your self-worth goes far beyond having the latest technology or the newest car. We all move at our own pace when it comes to our financial foundation, so you don’t need to show off to the rest of the world. Take care of your needs first.","Your goals that you’ve put aside are calling to you again ... are you listening? Get out of your own way, because it’s likely that the main person keeping you from following these ambitions is you. This doesn’t mean that you’re a failure -- it's quite the opposite. It’s not too late for you to try and these goals aren't too lofty for you to accomplish. You have a great work ethic and have already overcome hardship, so why not revisit these goals and see where they lead?","Your wallet could suffer if you're more focused on having fun than you are on your budget. There’s less of a danger from other people's influence right now and more of a danger of self-sabotaging. It seems like self-discipline would be easier than it actually is, and those impulse buys add up quickly when you’re not counting. Before spending money on something shiny and new that you come across, slowly count to ten and then ask yourself if you still really want it.","Your wallet could suffer if you're more focused on having fun than you are on your budget.

2021-03-24,"The world can make us feel small now, and the best way to combat that feeling is to grow. We're able to focus on nourishing our inner and outer selves under the intuitive Moon's trine to the confident Sun. However, the Moon's opposition to critical Saturn at 1:38 pm EDT can lead us to self-sabotage right when we're about to get what we want. It's best to focus on where we can improve instead of where we failed, and Luna's later sextile to confident Mars helps to strengthen our resolve.","Your finances are at the forefront of your life right now, yet there may be obstacles to being responsible with your money. You are more willing to put yourself out there when it comes to new financial enterprises, and as long as you’ve put in the preparation, you will make a good impression on people who can help you in the career sector. The temptation to do the bare minimum can be strong under the current planetary influence, but power through, and you are bound to succeed.","The people who enforce the rules in your life seem to be getting you down, and home and comfort are calling your name. You’ll get the most emotional fulfillment now from lowkey plans that involve staying at home and simply enjoying the company of loved ones, but still, people like parents or bosses are being more demanding now and can cause you additional stress and worry. The best thing you can do is leave these responsibilities at the door when you come home -- they'll be there tomorrow!","You are coming across as brave and bold to others right now, but also more intense. Although you’re more likely to be upfront and honest with people about what you want out of your relationships or friendships, the way that you’re expressing it might be harsher than you realize. Be careful with your word choices, as your intentions can easily be misinterpreted and taken offensively. If what you have to say might be taken the wrong way, you'll want to hold off until tomorrow.","Your reputation is blossoming under the current planetary energy, but your inner critic is trying to bring imposter syndrome back into the picture. Memories of an event from the past where you were let down or misunderstood by others could bring doubts into your mind. Instead of listening to this negative voice, remind yourself of everything that you’ve already overcome, and that everyone doubts themselves at times, especially right before they’re about to take big steps. Embrace the uncertainty and allow yourself to be proud of where you are.","It feels like it’s you vs. you today, and this is a battle you don’t need to fight. You are more likely to criticize yourself and others now, or someone may be doing this to you and you’re mentally agreeing with them. Let your friends hype you up instead; eat well and set yourself up for success so that you feel good throughout the day. Look in the mirror and realize that you wouldn’t criticize someone else as harshly as you criticize yourself; be a little kinder.","The deeper and more intimate side of life is calling to you, but busywork and distractions keep throwing you out of this place of truth. You have the opportunity to connect with someone in your life on a deeper level today, but you'll need to keep negative habits and diversions at bay. Schedule your day’s events, thinking about how you really want to spend it. Even though we don’t usually pencil in a heart-to-heart, leave space in your schedule for one.","Your luck fluctuates throughout the day, and any risks or gambles just don't seem to pay off in the way you want them to. Winning prizes or games is unlikely, and if you do win one, it will be by skill and not by chance. The other people in your life, especially your close friends and romantic relationships, will be the ones who end up putting a smile on your face and creating some good luck for you, so spend your time with those who care about you most.","While your mind is working quickly, your mouth is also working quickly and could get away from you if you’re not careful. Be wary of spreading gossip right now, because it’s likely to come back to haunt you in a way you weren’t expecting. It’s better to focus on how you can make things better or build bridges with others, because the way you make people feel now may determine whether or not they want to work with you. Show them your capable side and you’ll find success.","You’re full of energy now, but what you’re saying and what you’re feeling are not necessarily in alignment. You’re trying to keep all your relationships moving smoothly, yet on the inside, you’re not sure if you even want to be friends with some of the people in your circle. It’s a good idea to evaluate your affiliations now and decide whether or not you’re still around the people who inspire and encourage you. For any friends who actively make you feel bad about yourself, it’s time to go!","There’s a lot that needs your attention and you’re trying to make it all happen. You’re restless when it comes to work and you’re working overtime in order to feel more secure, yet you’re still not feeling secure. Ask yourself if there’s something you could do to improve things immediately, and if not, then pause and give yourself the kudos you deserve for doing the work that you’ve done. There’s always more than can be done, but you’re only one person, so allow yourself rest without feeling guilty.","It feels like déjà vu today, but you have an opportunity to make a different choice than you did last time. You’re more mature than you were the first time this situation came around, and your newfound wisdom will help you realize what needs to be said this time. Beware that you may be more critical of others now, so watch your tongue and make sure that you’re not going after the people who support you. Let go of the past and allow the present to be an improved version.","It feels like déjà vu today, but you have an opportunity to make a different choice than you did last time.

Beware that you may be more critical of others now, so watch your tongue and make sure that you’re not going after the people who support you. Let go of the past and allow the present to be an improved version."
2021-03-25,"There’s a reason that we have the gas pedal and the brake pedal in a car: we need them both! While this sounds like an obvious statement, the sensitive Moon's opposition with expanding Jupiter today makes us feel like we can step on the gas around the clock. But once the Moon moves into detail-oriented Virgo at 11:25 pm EDT, we'll want to step on the brakes and look at where we’re really heading. We need to take off our blinders and look honestly at our options.","Opening up to others is easier today, but oversharing is easier as well. It can be difficult to find the line when it comes to telling people about your personal life, so be sure you can trust the person that you’re pouring your heart out to. You're moving away from certain relationships and it's okay to let others know if you're moving on, but don't share details that the other person wouldn't want shared. If you wouldn't want them to say it about you, keep it to yourself.","Prying eyes are trying to see what you're up to, but you might want to keep some areas of life to yourself. You're learning what to share and what not to share before you see it come to fruition, and this is helping you to grow more assured of your boundaries and your ability to control your own narrative. If no one knows what you’re up to, they’re likely to start guessing. While you can correct them, you can also let gossips do their thing while you hold your head high.","You're tempted to share your thoughts with someone, but make sure that they're desiring what you're giving them. The balance of power in your relationships is activated, especially the power that you have over each other with words. Becoming too opinionated or critical when it comes to your friends or your significant other can cause them to feel like they’re under scrutiny with you. Try to live and let live, even if you feel they’re not doing what you would do in the situation.","Overindulgence and apathy will catch up to you quickly today. There is likely more on your to-do list than you wanted, or you're just not feeling up to completing your regular routine due to a lack of energy. Try to power through the ""blah"" feelings and get a jump on your tasks for the day, because if you put them off, you could see a snowball effect resulting in too much to do at the end of the day. Help your future self to get a good night’s sleep!","Someone is spinning you a yarn that sounds wonderful, but it might not be everything they say it is. Whether they're trying to convince you to buy something from them, take them up on an offer, or give them a chance romantically, don't feel like you have to give in just because they're persistent. Odds are, if it’s really meant for you, it will still be there for you tomorrow, and the decision won’t feel like you’re in a pressure cooker then.","Your family is disturbing your personal peace, either through positive or negative methods. Sometimes our families indulge us too much and keep us from standing on our own two feet, while other times they try to use tough love and inadvertently hurt our confidence. No matter what side of the spectrum you're experiencing, it will help to introduce balance to the situation. This is an opportunity to set some boundaries that will provide you with more peace.","You could easily trigger a reaction if you’re speaking carelessly to your coworkers or friends, as everyone is feeling extra sensitive today. You’ll need to be careful with your words, especially in the workplace. Even with good rumors, you may not want to tell everyone right away, because it’s likely to end in disappointment if it’s not properly recounted. Wait until you have confirmation that your positive news is sure to materialize, then feel free to share it with the world.","Someone may bring you information about a lucrative deal, but it's not likely to pan out the way you hope it will. You’re learning about how to manage your money now, and there's a lot of temptation in this situation that is urging you to walk on the wild side. However, rush decisions involving money will likely be regretted at the end of the day, especially if you’re going over budget in order to meet the price. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.","There’s so much that you want to do for others right now, but there’s only so much that you can realistically do with the 24 hours in the day. You are feeling extra optimistic when it comes to your abilities, but be sure that you’re not convincing yourself and others to expect something that can’t be done. Under-promising and over-delivering is the key to your success now. Managing expectations from the beginning will help prevent stress at the end of the day.","There’s so much to choose from, but this myriad of choices might throw you for a loop. There’s opportunity after opportunity for fun, however, most will cost you money and, if you’re too indulgent, you will regret it by the end of the day. Try to live your life in moderation to the best of your abilities now, because being boastful or greedy is likely to bring you a headache in the end. If you don’t really want it, let it be.","You may be so focused on your personal mission lately that you’re letting your relationships wither. It’s easy to lose track of time and get lost in work or your own head right now, but your friends and family still care about you and would like to know how you’re doing. Take a moment to update the people who care about you, but avoid dominating the conversation with your news. Connecting takes two, so let them update you as well.","Your career is asking a lot of you, and you may be wondering if it’s worth it to keep going. This job was here when you needed one, but now that you’re more established, you have more options. It might be time to start sending around your resume again to see if someone is looking for the skills that you have. If you’re satisfied with where you are, then you're meant to use this time to find a healthier approach to your work that allows you to get more rest."
2021-03-26,"Friendship and love are all around us, but it's up to us to keep our relationships running smoothly. The confident Sun's conjunction with loving Venus envelops us in an easygoing energy, while the intuitive Moon's trine to innovative Uranus invites us to make our dreams a reality. However, the Moon's square to fiery Mars at 10:16 pm EDT can disrupt the vibe, so watch for flaring tempers. It's best to keep a cool head and make our connections earlier, so we can rest peacefully once Mars starts causing trouble.","You're feeling good about yourself and full of energy, so let the warmth of the Sun and Venus in your sign guide you toward people who love you and who may have gifts for you. This is one of those times where you know what's best for yourself intuitively, and your instincts are apt to take you on a lucky little adventure. The only thing that would throw off this self-affirming energy would be things like car trouble or even careless remarks, so drive and speak with care.","You’re not the same person you used to be, and you’re embracing the difference between who you were and the more introspective person you are now. Spiritual health and comfort is becoming a priority in your life, with you feeling more spiritually loved and prosperous as you practice forgiveness. Others may be stubborn when it comes to accepting this new, self-aware you, but don’t let this keep you from your journey. Let them accept you, but if they don’t, you don’t have to change back.","Your friends are helping you to learn more about how you feel in your own skin, however, your fear instincts might try to push this away. You’ll experience far more success if you stay out of your own way! While you don’t have to take any advice that feels wrong for you or allow others to control you, you will want to avoid cutting people off before they’ve had a chance to say what’s in their hearts. Practice patience, and think carefully on any wise words you receive now.","Others probably see you as someone who has their life together, but you are experiencing a lack of energy right now that makes it difficult to keep all the wheels turning. You'll need to be honest with yourself if you need help, because trying to do it all alone could lead to a very exhausted you. Ask for what you need assistance with and someone in your life is likely to show up to support you. Plus, you'll have an excuse to do something nice for them in the future!","A blunt remark that you don't expect from someone could cause a blow to your self-esteem. While words can hurt, though, it’s likely that this person was projecting and that you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Try to let any negativity roll off of you like water off of a duck’s back, and allow them time to cool down instead of you retaliating. Aggression is not the answer; compromise will create a better atmosphere for everyone.","Your initiative can take you far, but a critical comment from a superior might leave you doubting your capabilities. Your attempts at making things easier or more efficient are likely to be met with dissatisfaction or impatience, so you may want to avoid rocking the boat now unless you’re ready to take on some conflict and fight for what you’re trying to accomplish. While this resolve is admirable, you’re more likely to have success in making these changes at a later time.","Someone may try to educate you in a way that’s offensive or embarrassing to you, but they’re not necessarily being malicious. This is likely to be a very pleasant time with the people in your life, but there may be a teacher or an older person who has opinions that they’re insisting on sharing, despite the awkwardness that it creates between you. Educate them back in a way, and try to let them know that what they said made you uncomfortable without attacking them.","While you're feeling well and your relationships are like a breath of fresh air right now, you may be inclined to overindulge in your obsessions. Perhaps things are so good that you want to spend your time consumed with something or someone that you love, however, you’ll end up making yourself sick of anything that you overexpose yourself to. Try and balance what you focus on today, but if you're going to indulge anyway, at least make sure you’re indulging in something that’s good for you.","People are focused on you today, especially within the workplace, and they may act on this in an unpredictable way. Pranks or jokes are likely now, but sometimes it can be difficult to know where a joke ends and bullying begins. What’s important is how it made you feel and their intentions, and if it felt like it was meant to tear you down, address it. However, if you feel you can trust them and it was in the spirit of fun, it’s okay to laugh at yourself.","With a demanding to-do list in front of you and a strong desire to shake off the humdrum routine you’re used to, you may just feel like running away from it all. However, the day has some fun surprises for you that you’ll want to stick around for. What's more, a family member or roommate can help you to enjoy your errands instead of dread them if you let them come along for the ride. Two heads are better than one!","That project you’ve been procrastinating is finally needing your attention, and now you’re dreading trying to manage it with the time you have left. Although your friends and other allies are willing to support you, it will more likely be in the form of words of encouragement or gifts rather than actual help with your work. Instead of worrying about the final outcome, breathe and try to break it down into bite-sized chunks that you can complete. Bit by bit, you'll see your progress.","Your self-confidence is higher than usual and you may feel a strong desire to pursue someone in a friendly, romantic, or business relationship. However, your family members or other people you live with have expressed their disinterest in this person. You want to make everyone happy, but you’re aware that there’s someone who will have to end up dissatisfied with the outcome. Whatever you decide, be honest with both parties about your choice and be honest with yourself about what would ultimately make you happy."
2021-03-27,"We must trust our instincts and move cautiously as we walk through today's fog. The intuitive Moon's opposition to intellectual Mercury can cause feelings to cloud and distort our logic, so we should try not to take anything to heart. The Moon's second opposition to distorting Neptune at 11:05 am EDT only adds to the fogginess, so it’s best to avoid signing contracts or making other large commitments if we can. Thankfully, we have Luna's trine with powerful Pluto to help us clear our heads by the end of the night.","You’re being forced to work on what you already have right now and tie up loose ends before you try to move on. You'd be wise to stick with what you know -- reaching into the unknown and hypothesizing or creating scenarios in your mind will not lead you to success. It’s better to try and hone the skills that you already have or work on projects that you have already begun, because under today's energy, false starts are more likely than fairytale beginnings.","The crowd may be getting in the way of your own self-expression, as the creativity and optimism that you’re trying to show off is lost on them. You have been working hard on something that you’re proud of and you want to share it with the world, but make sure that you read the room beforehand. A dark cloud from an earlier negative issue -- likely unrelated to you -- is hanging over the people around you, so it might be best to save your debut for another day.","You’ve been giving it your all, but now you’re not sure if your efforts were helpful or in vain. Situations at work may be causing you to doubt yourself, but let the doubt transform into something more powerful, like a resolve to be better next time, or to be humble when your contribution didn’t go the way you planned. Be confident in your quest to improve yourself, especially when you make a mistake. Every mistake you make is a step toward finding the right path.","Your core beliefs and morals might actually be clouding your judgment now, causing you to come across the opposite of how you mean to. Sometimes you must step outside your own worldview and defer to others who have experienced situations that you’ve never been a part of. Before jumping in with your bit of advice or shared knowledge, make sure that what you have to say isn’t irrelevant or insensitive. It’s easy to put your foot in your mouth now, so try being a good listener.","People that you trusted may not have done what you asked of them, and now you’re left to pick up the pieces. This could be as serious as a backstabbing betrayal from a friend or as simple as your child forgetting to take dinner out to thaw. Either way, you will likely have to go back and redo some items on your to-do list, especially if you were delegating them to someone else. If it is a more serious issue, you may want to let the cleanup wait until tomorrow.","There’s something that someone is avoiding saying, and you’re sensitive to this. While it could be a positive surprise that someone is keeping a secret, it also could be that their story has been tweaked to prevent you from hearing something that you wouldn’t like to hear. You won’t get to the bottom of it right away, and it’s actually better to let the other person think what they want about the situation. Your self-esteem must be based on who you are, not the words or actions of others.","Exhaustion is taking hold, and there’s no need to prioritize work over your health. If you’re feeling under the weather or just drained, it’s okay to be honest about it and let others know that you’re not feeling well. Although they may not believe you or may think that you’re trying to avoid your responsibilities, what they suspect and what you’re really feeling don’t have to line up to be true. Do what you need to do to be healthy.","You're very tempted to try to steer the ship for everyone right now. Manipulation tactics won’t help you -- in fact they are likely to backfire. It’s better to tap into your emotional security so that you can empathize with others without attaching yourself to how they react to their own issues. Trying to fix everyone else's problems can be perceived as controlling, so step back, but hold your arms open to comfort those who need it.","Pay attention to your surroundings today and you’ll see people jumping to conclusions and being more sensitive than normal, even about subjects that didn’t bother them in the past. Don't talk without thinking first, even if what you’re saying logically makes sense -- use your emotional intuition before you speak, and try to speak carefully when bringing up sensitive subjects around elders or superiors at work. You may receive an apology or a confession now, and it’s better for both of you to be graceful when you receive it.","You could be questioned today about what you really believe, where you truly stand, and the way you express yourself. You know who you are inside, but it can be hard to show this to everyone on the outside and be perceived the way you want to be. The less you say, the better, in order to help you avoid misunderstandings and hurt feelings. It’s best to save any personal changes or big announcements until at least later in the evening, when the energy is more favorable for transforming your image.","Distractions are aplenty and they’ll do their best to knock you off your game today. While your head is in the clouds, you may misplace important items or overspend your money. Remind yourself to keep an eye on your wallet and your budget, because you could lose track of your cash in more ways than one. It’s important to be present and pay attention to what’s going on around you, and luckily, this extra focus is really all that you need to make it through unscathed.","While everyone else is actively dealing with the way they’re feeling, you’re just trying to figure out how you’re feeling, period. Your emotional rollercoaster is at the part where it turns into a tunnel, and while you can feel it speeding along, you can’t see what’s going on. Now is not the time to confess your feelings to others or to make sweeping statements, because you might change how you feel completely by tonight. If someone brings you a big decision, it’s best to sleep on it."
2021-03-28,"Balance is restored, but this can be uncomfortable when you’re used to unevenness. The Full Moon in Libra is the star of the show at 2:48 pm EDT, rewarding those who have cultivated a happy medium, and revealing the truth to those who've allowed power dynamics to slide. The Moon's opposition to harmonious Venus makes this a delicate balancing act, as Venus is opposite her own sign of Libra and feeling assertive in fiery Aries. Once the Moon trines disciplined Saturn this evening, we’ll have more determination to find our equilibrium.","Your relationships are highlighted, and the people in your life who give either too much or too little will be evident. If you find that you’re carrying the bulk of the load in a friendship, or your significant other does everything for you even when you try to reclaim your independence, it’s time to have a conversation and express how you feel about this imbalance. If the relationship is too uneven, it’ll likely end in disappointment. Put in the time and effort with the people who are willing to change with you.",You may realize today that what was once a fun pastime has turned into a bad habit for you. These repetitive actions that keep you distracted and in a haze of illusion don’t have to be taboo or illegal to be keeping you in a negative place -- consuming too much of anything can keep you from living a full life. Be honest with yourself and identify what’s preventing you from seeing the real picture. Less is more now; spend some time in silence and refresh your brain.,"The good news is that both your friends and loved ones are looking out for you, however, they seem to be using conflicting methods and causing you some mental hassle. The balance you need to reincorporate into your life isn’t necessarily between two people, though, it’s more about spending time the way you want to spend time. Right now you’re in the position of having to explain the right way to love you, rather than just getting to feel loved. Let everyone know that you can explain your needs best.","There are rewards waiting for you in the opportunities that are being presented to you now, but you may be avoiding them in favor of more comfortable situations from the past. Try to remember the outcome from the last time that you avoided growth by choosing to hide in your comfort zone. These opportunities, although a little overwhelming, are here to help you to achieve what you really want. Make sure your comfort zone isn’t turning into a cage.","What your mind is creating and what your eyes are showing you aren’t in sync. Either someone is deceiving you or you are deceiving yourself when it comes to your perception of them. Whether or not there are malicious intentions, this perception is affecting both of you and causing you to act differently. You may be acting overly suspicious toward them, or on the opposite end, you might be avoiding seeing something obvious. Be tactful and communicate as clearly as possible now.","You are especially focused on yourself today and will approach financial situations with more emotion than usual. You do have a golden opportunity to improve your finances through getting organized and approaching your life with more intention, but the temptation to spend the day browsing sales online will be hard to resist. Retail therapy could easily run away from you and turn into a receipt that you regret. Other people may also demand more for themselves now, so know your boundaries when it comes time to open your wallet.","You and the people around you are feeling hypersensitive or especially proud, and may create drama out of a perceived lack of respect or trust. Do not handle this energy flippantly if the hypersensitivity comes from someone in your life. If you’re the one being emotionally set off, try to have a cool head. The emotional reactions that are happening now are worse than the actual problems, which can be solved quickly with a little creativity. Instead of spiraling into gloom and doom, think outside the box and free yourself.","Your energy is low today and you may not want to deal with your responsibilities, even those as small as household chores. It’s okay to take care of yourself and recover if you’ve been overworking yourself lately, and don’t rush yourself back into a frenzied pace right after just because you feel like you’re falling behind. If your body requires some extra sleep, then let those dishes rest in the sink until tomorrow. You can’t let your health be the last priority on your list anymore.","Changing friend groups or losing coworkers may have caused you to feel out of sorts recently, and it’s time to restore your inner equilibrium. You have a knack for moving on without much effort, but this doesn’t mean that you don’t feel anything when the people you care about are no longer in your life, or, at least, aren’t with you as often anymore. Reach out today to someone that you want to spend more time with, even if it’s hard to make the first move. Open the door.","Chaos and uncertainty about your future and your place in this world can make you want to escape today. Take a deep breath and center yourself, and remember that running away from a problem often causes it to show up at your next destination. Your lessons will keep repeating until you’ve fully learned them, and ducking out while the teacher is still teaching won’t get you anywhere. Let yourself feel the uncertainty, then do what you can to make the odds be in your favor.","Your mind is hyperaware of the little details now and you aren't afraid to say what you see. You could very easily end up projecting your standards onto others through criticism, though, so make sure that the message you’re trying to convey is actually helpful and not tearing down anyone's self-esteem. Others will appreciate your constructive criticism, as long as they ask for it. Doing something for yourself like updating your look or having a personal spa day may also help to improve your mental outlook.","Others may be trying to force you to change yourself, but they aren't looking to see how this is affecting you. Even if you didn't ask for their input, it’s here anyway, and now you have to figure out how to reply without being dramatic. Let them know that you are aware of yourself and humble, but that you’re not looking for feedback on things that are a part of who you are, especially the things that you can’t change. If they respect you, they’ll understand."
2021-03-29,"This day will be a lot of things, but it won't be boring! The Moon's early-morning trines to both fiery Mars and abundant Jupiter increase our bravery and optimism when we express ourselves, but the Moon's square to secretive Pluto adds a spicy, unexpected shocker to our emotions. As we lead up to the conjunction between intellectual Mercury and nebulous Neptune at 11:24 pm EDT, it is hard to know what’s real and what’s fantasy, so we should avoid making commitments and give in to the twists and turns of the rollercoaster.","A run-in with an authority figure can be frustrating, but hold your tongue. Speaking out of turn or adding fuel to a verbal fire will throw off your day, whether it’s with your parents or with a superior at work. Try to lay low even if you feel the fire rising within, because it’s likely that you’ll regret what you said by the time tomorrow rolls around. Your friends and romantic partners are on your side now more than ever; you have nothing to prove!","Relief is rolling in as the career and financial issues that have been plaguing you start to dissipate; you can help to move them along by being present in your current life. While it’s not a great time to take a long trip to somewhere far away, you can see improvements close to home if you’re paying attention. Having your head in the clouds and daydreaming about the future will throw a wrench in your plans, so remember to give your attention to what’s in front of you now.","You’re in a phase of making bold moves and your fun and creative approach is impressing the people around you. Still, someone older or in charge may disapprove of your innovative methods today. Try not to fault them for being suspicious of your new ways, as many people have their own tried-and-true systems that they feel they must cling to in order to succeed. Let them know that you have a more freeform approach to life, without feeling the need to put them down in the process.","Your creative juices are flowing and you’re able to get in touch with your spiritual side through writing or art, but watch out for other people who are throwing off your focus. It may simply be well-meaning people seeking your attention, but if they’re insulting your core beliefs, rest assured that their opinions don’t have to affect the way you feel. As long as you’re not hurting or demeaning anyone, your beliefs are your own and it’s okay to express them, despite what others may think.","Although you’re receiving support and encouragement from your community, if you’re not prepared for a project or presentation, you’ll feel worried no matter what. All the well-wishers in the world can speak words of praise to your work, but in the end, the time and effort that you put in to making it great will be what determines how you feel. If you don’t think it’s finished, then don’t rush yourself. Allow others to help you in your preparation rather than simply cheering you on, and you’ll enjoy the solidarity!","You’re on top of things and you’ve never been more organized in your approach to life, but self-sabotage is still lurking in the form of overindulgence. You can even overindulge in things like organization, causing others to wonder why you're spending so much time reworking your entire life. You don’t have to conform to the timeline of others, but if there are relationships that you want to keep alive, it might be time to put down your projects and call someone you’ve been meaning to talk to for too long.","Luck is on your side today and you’re able to create your own luck without much effort, as long as you come from a place of pure intentions. Being manipulative or passive aggressive will not benefit you whatsoever; you’ll have an easier time being honest with people, even if you’re in conflict at the time. You may also feel like you're being pushed to conform by a very traditional authority figure in your life, but you'll need to decide if you want to stick to the old ways or blaze new trails.","People around you may be engaging in actions that you don’t approve of, but they aren’t necessarily hurting anyone. What you say today can make the difference between good vibes and bad ones, so try to speak with kindness to others. You’re in touch with your emotions and your family roots especially now, and you want to protect the ones you love, but you may go about it in a way that is too overprotective. Loosen your grip on what others are doing and you’ll feel more relaxed as well.","Issues of security can crop up for you now, but whether it’s emotional or financial, your support system will be there to pick you up when you’re down. Reach out if you need someone to help you with what you can’t do yourself, even if that’s just cheering you up. Luckily, the energy and optimism that they can provide is enough to clear away the grey skies and help you to rise to the challenges in your life. It all comes down to communicating how you feel.","Although things like finances and health seem to be improving for you, you might be your own worst enemy now. You’re feeling better about life, yet you may actually be procrastinating in order to prevent yourself from moving forward. This could be an attempt to self-sabotage, so check yourself and make sure that you’re thinking realistically instead of trying to distract your mind. An important ally in your career may offer you something that helps you refocus your ambitions, so don’t turn it away!","It’s easy to get lost in daydreams now, but if you find yourself obsessing over something that’s been bothering you, it will only drain your energy. Your imagination is very active and your mind is bursting with ideas, but you’ll need to channel these creative powers in the right ways to avoid getting bogged down in bad habits or fears. Writing down how you’re feeling or making a piece of art as a form of emotional expression will help to engage your mind, satisfy your spirit, and calm your heart.","Old passions are beckoning you, and now you’re returning to them as a changed person. You may finally get back to work on a project that you set aside for a long time, perhaps something you set aside due to the discouragement of others or the fear of what other people may think. It’s time to stop worrying about what the crowd will say and do what makes your heart sing. Whatever happens, at least you can say that you embraced your own authenticity."
2021-03-30,"It’s time to dig deep and make some tough calls. The emotional Moon enters intense Scorpio, making it easier to talk about the difficult or taboo subjects of life. Pleasant Venus' sextile to realistic Saturn at 11:47 am EDT helps us find our way in the dark, striking a balance between what’s appropriate and what’s truthful. Although the Moon’s challenging aspects to Uranus and Saturn make it hard to choose between changing or staying the same, we will benefit from being able to vent our frustrations to the people who love us.","You may get into an emotional conflict with someone over shared items or business partnerships, and you’ll need to balance being assertive with compromising. You’ll do the most good for yourself by being graceful as you try to negotiate your shared financial situation with a person who’s creating a difficult atmosphere for you both. This situation doesn’t have to create bad blood between you. Emotional discipline will put out fires before they start, so keep boundaries now in order to prevent yourself from feeling resentful.","You seem to have reached an obsessive level about someone in your life, which can have a smothering effect on them that is difficult to reconcile. Your emotions are affecting your judgment right now when it comes to other people, and your ability to see their words and actions for what they really are is hazy. Arguments and important conversations are clouded by this emotionality, so it may be best to reschedule any important dates, decisions, or discussions for another time.","Your mind is worrying about the little details or things that you can no longer change, yet it will be helpful to look at the big picture instead of the minutia. Your friends are apt to encourage and compliment you now, and if you’re able to turn your focus away from self-criticism, then you’ll emotionally benefit from their wisdom. When you’re fretting over small things going wrong, ask yourself if you’ll remember this problem a week from now. If not, let it go!","Everything is not going according to plan, especially when it comes to the younger people in your life. You may have had a dream for someone else, perhaps a child or a friend, and they’re now deviating from what you wanted them to do. Although you might have seen them following another path in your mind, remember that they have free will of their own and, ultimately, it is their decision to live with. Live and let live, because trying to control others will only push them away in the end.","You’ve got the urge to spend free time at home today, enjoying the safety and comfort of your inner sanctum. Work is likely to be chaotic, and your loved ones are trying to help you leave all the drama at work instead of bringing it home. While they mean well, this may not be what you need either. Let them know that if they’re going to spend time helping you decompress, they’ll need to keep it calm and cozy.","The darker and more raw side of life appeals to you now, yet you may overshare if you’re not careful. You don’t have time to chit-chat; you’re only interested in opening up the more intense, emotional conversations. Know your audience, though, because not everyone is ready to bare their soul in front of someone through words. Make sure that the other person is in the right place before you bring them these dark or steamy topics of conversation, but know that there’s likely someone who will be willing to indulge you.","Loved ones who have helped you in the past need your help now, but you may not be feeling so generous. This could be a difficult energy to sit with, especially if you’re feeling financially shaky or you’re being cautious with a beloved possession. While you can only do so much, you might be able to give back a little more than you think. Gratitude and generosity go a long way now, and it will feel better to know that you helped someone in need.","You seem to have more energy and better overall wellness right now, and some free time, too, so make sure you don't let this idle time cause you to create issues where there are none. You are especially prone to turn the microscope on yourself and your life now, and may end up magnifying problems that are small in reality or creating negative scenarios in your mind. Practice letting things go and show yourself that you can be as forgiving of yourself as you are of others.","Running away from your problems will only cause them to grow in size, so be prepared to put a stop to something that’s been troubling you lately. This may be an annoying coworker who won’t stop criticizing you or a friend that constantly brings up the negative side of life when you’re trying to celebrate a success. Let them know what’s bothering you so that you’re able to move on in peace, and they’ll eventually be thankful that you set some boundaries as well.","Your feelings can easily run away from you when you're dealing with group dynamics today, and you’re more likely to give in to peer pressure. You may feel a strong fear of missing out, but ask yourself if you want to be there because you want to be there, or if you want to be there because you don’t want to be left out. If it's the former, then go for it, just keep your emotions in check. If it's the latter, you may need to consider your own deeper needs.","Surprising events caused by your family or people in your household can make you change your plans for the day, so be ready to revise things as you go. It’s hard to avoid wearing your heart on your sleeve now -- it’s best to be honest about what you feel, because it’s likely written all over your face anyway. You’ll find that friends and loved ones who are willing to accept you as you are will have good advice for you and will help you roll with the punches.","Your financial situation may begin to improve due to something that you forgot about or a surprise gift. However, your immediate desire to be free could cause you to say something you don’t mean. Don’t let your honest reaction be confused with ingratitude, because you are likely to come off as insensitive or reckless now. Instead of letting pride take over your blessings, be receptive to the kindness of others. You never know what motivated them to help you out, and it may be more for them than for you."
2021-03-31,"The planets are getting along much better today than yesterday, supporting us both inside and out. The emotional Moon's trine to imaginative Neptune allows us to tap into our artistic and spiritual sides, while her trine to clever Mercury adds an intellectual and rapid influence to our inner monologue. When the confident Sun sextiles disciplined Saturn at 5:04 pm EDT, we can meet our goals with precision, while the Moon's sextile to deep Pluto allows us to make these positive mindsets more permanent in our lives.","The lessons that you’ve learned from being a part of your community in the past can help you in your present life. Even the skills that you’ve picked up while just hanging out with people you enjoy can be of great use to you now, helping you impress business partners and superiors in your workplace with these acquired social abilities. While you couldn’t really have consciously prepared for this, thankfully, life was preparing you for it all along.","It’s hard to see the progress that’s being made for you now, but rest assured, you’re being talked about in rooms that you haven’t even been in yet. This private conversation that you’re the topic of is a positive one -- one that will help you to build the future you’ve been dreaming of. You’ve already put in the hard work and expressed your interest in the opportunity, so all that’s left to do is enjoy yourself and stay positive until you hear the results.","Your spirit is lifted as others show interest in you today -- it's not necessarily that you've changed anything recently, people are just appreciating you for who you are. Your friendship is less likely to be taken for granted now, and a friend may even have a gift or a positive word for you that carries your mood throughout the rest of the day. The little things matter to you more than usual, and the people who love you are showing up in thoughtful ways that you’ll remember for a long time.","The appreciation you've been looking for from your superiors is finally arriving today, and your work may be applauded by a powerful person that you didn’t know was even aware of you. While this kind of praise can be overwhelming, do your best to be gracious, and have something in your back pocket for when they ask you what your plans are for your next ambition. Be on your A-game now, because it will take you further in your career than usual.","Far-off people and places are calling to you, and even if you aren't able to travel, someone from far away can put a smile on your face today. This person may be someone you met while in school or on a spiritual journey, and now they’re re-entering your life to offer you some fun and freedom. This is a great time for you to network, especially if you’re looking to move your operation abroad somewhere. Opportunities come when you spread your wings.","It looks like your investments and working relationships are going more smoothly than usual and providing you with ease of mind. This makes it a good time to communicate your feelings to others, even if you aren’t sure how they will receive them. This is especially true when it comes to issues of power, trust, or shared possessions, and you’ll feel better once you’re able to discuss what’s troubling you. You’ll end the day feeling emotionally lighter, finally having laid some of your worries to rest.","More warmth and emotional security come to you from your relationships today, and you'll feel more at ease in situations where you might normally feel awkward. It won't take as much effort to make a decision, and the day will seem to flow without much conflict between friends or lovers. Although you'll probably want to just take things slow, so will the other people in your life, so enjoy the relaxed speed of the day and bask in the good feelings.","Your energy is high and your mind is working rapidly today, helping you to finish your work with ample time and stamina to spare. The extra energy that you still have after completing your to-do list can be well spent with your family or the people you live with -- it's a great time to play games or watch a funny movie together. The time you spend reminiscing and laughing will wash away any worries of yesterday and help you to make new memories.","Good luck and laughter arrive to you through youthfulness and children now. Positive new influences may also come into your life in the form of parents or people who work with kids. If you don’t have children in your life, this may simply be a time to let your hair down and have some fun lazing around or playing games with loved ones. It’s not likely that you’ll get much done today, but some days are better spent enjoying yourself. Do whatever helps you feel like a kid again!","The support you need is here, but you'll need to be open to receiving it. You may have been beating yourself up over something recently or refusing to forgive someone, but this can cause you to isolate yourself. Although you often deal with your problems on your own, open up a little and let someone be your shoulder to lean on. Friends and family alike can help you shut down negative thinking now and leave grudges and judgments in the past. It’s time to find closure.","You’re able to think and move quickly now and you can fix problems for yourself and others with ease. Coworkers and friends will appreciate your mental prowess and agility, and any help that you give is very likely to return to you in one form or another soon. People are feeling more giving and friendly toward you, and it’s emotionally fulfilling to help someone out, so embrace the generous attitude of the day and pay it forward.","Your financial situation is becoming steadier and your self-esteem is improving all the time, now that you seem to have less worry about what the future will bring. Harness this secure energy and spend time reading or meditating, in the morning if you can. Centering yourself at the beginning of the day will allow you to carry this mindset into the rest of your activities. You might find that stability and peace is more desirable to you than excitement. Enjoy the calm and see how long you can keep it going."
2021-04-01,"We are not much in the mood for practical jokes this April Fools’ Day. The Moon in Sagittarius shows its serious side as it makes harmonious aspects in the morning with both wounded Chiron and somber Saturn. By maintaining our focus and responsibility, though, we can make calm and determined progress toward addressing whatever has been troubling us. Then, when the Moon reaches its healing trine with the Sun at 10:46 pm EDT, we'll feel more relaxed and on track.","Your vibrant personality is on display with the Sun in your sign, but you might feel that your personal wounds have been more visible lately as well. While the Moon illuminates and activates your philosophical side today, it's a good time to get some perspective on those wounds and how they fit into your larger view of your life. You may also find that contact with your community, even if it is just through social media, helps you stay grounded.","This could be an intense day for you, Taurus, as circumstances push you to look at your hidden wounds. These wounds may have to do with feeling like you were let down by a significant authority figure in your past, like a parent, boss, or mentor. Today, however, you can get the support you need from the superiors and role models who are relevant to you now. You might even be one yourself. You cannot change your past, but you can move empowered into your future.","You love having a lot of people in your life, but it can be hard when they need more than lighthearted fun from you. Today, you may find that a close relationship is pushing you to clarify your view of the world. When your big ideas conflict with the needs of an actual person you care about, you may have to decide whose side you are on. No matter what you choose, though, it may be impossible to make everybody happy.","You can finally make some progress today on whatever bureaucratic snarl has had you bogged down for a while; you are well-equipped to cut through the red tape on taxes, insurance, shared property, and more. Your natural Cancer sensitivity will also help you navigate the emotional undercurrents that are making things more complicated than they need to be. You may even discover that a boss or other authority figure who seems to be hurting you or others has actually been hurt themselves, providing some perspective on the situation.","Some important relationships in your life have become more serious than they used to be, and you are suddenly aware of how heavy things feel. You are also a little worried about losing yourself. Today, the universe asks you to figure out how to get your sense of fun back. You might have to take some time alone to think through all the things in your life that have changed in the past few months. How can you make room for what is new and still be you?","Some of the shared responsibilities in your life might not truly be shared. Something may happen at home today that feels like the last straw, but keep in mind that you are not just upset about what is happening in that moment -- you have a much larger feeling that everything is all on you and that others are not pulling their weight. It can be hard to ask for help, but that is the only way you will get help.","It has been hard to have fun lately ... it feels like everything has become too serious, especially your relationships. Today, you can at least relieve some of the tension by talking things out. It still probably will not be a party, but you will at least feel like others are willing to work with you in a constructive way. To get them definitively on your side, however, you may have to get better at articulating where you personally stand. Know how you feel before you speak up.","You have been pushed to be responsible lately, especially with heavy stuff like family, health, and work issues. Today, however, you might have a financial breakthrough that lightens some of your other burdens. It could be as simple as taking another look at the resources you already have, because sometimes money hides in plain sight. You have enough sense to not do anything frivolous with your modest newfound gain, but it feels good to finally have something go your way.","Your emotional side is on display with the Moon entering in your sign today. Lately, you may have been feeling like you need to restrict what you say and how you express yourself in order to avoid causing trouble. Today, though, whatever you have been holding back might come out whether you want it to or not. You are capable of cleaning up a mess if it comes to that, but chances are, the reception will turn out to be more understanding than you expect.","This is a day to look within and get insight on what is really preventing you from achieving your financial goals. Your ability to root out hidden forms of self-sabotage is stronger than usual today. Still, tension at home may distract you from this task, as spontaneous disruptions arise and upend your carefully organized routine. The answer to your problem, however, may turn out to involve becoming just a little more spontaneous. Sometimes, the right path is not the planned one.","In many ways you have been refining your identity over the past several months, and changes may have been brewing in private even longer than that. Now, your larger circle of acquaintances will get to meet the new you. Some might be surprised and you might even get a few tactless responses, but most people will follow your lead. It’s hard not to be vulnerable about this kind of change, but if you can maintain some level of confidence while being vulnerable, that will help.","Career dynamics are highlighted for you today, especially surrounding authority figures. The person who is holding you back from the money you feel you deserve may not be your current boss. Normally, your intuition about things like this is strong, but it has been challenged lately, so you might have to try something outside your regular routine to recharge your capacity for insight. Going for a long walk or drive could give the space you need for a fresh perspective."
2021-04-02,"There is a battle brewing today between the forces of clear thought and emotional strife. Intellectual Mercury in intuitive Pisces makes a stabilizing sextile to penetrating Pluto at 2:04 am EDT, giving us the capacity to draw connections and see how things fit together. However, the Moon then jumps into a tinderbox of messy aspects with aggressive Mars and sensitive Neptune, provoking us to jump to conclusions and take offense easily. We will be challenged to determine which fights are truly important.","There's an aggressive edge to your communication today. Maybe something about politics or religion sets you off, and you idealize yourself as a champion of the downtrodden, whether they want your help or not. You could do more good, though, if you focus on organizing what is actually within your scope of authority. That kind of work may feel less gratifying in the moment than grandstanding would, but if you can stay calm today, you can have deep insights that lead to real progress.","Money frustrations might set you off today, especially if there is someone else you can blame for the trouble. You might be tempted to vent on social media or draw your larger posse into the drama, but that would only add to the problem. Stay focused on the big picture and have faith that justice will win in the end. In the meantime, try to see how the situation fits into your larger philosophical view of the world.","Your close relationships may drive you crazy today... You are finally making progress in your life, but the people you rely on to have your back seem to be getting in your way and taking offense at everything you do, as if they see your success as a threat. You might be tempted to break ties with someone in the heat of an argument, but thinking about the shared obligations that keep you bonded could give you some needed perspective.","Minor frustrations seem major today and you might not even know why you are so angry. Turning to your close relationships for support can help you get out of your funk, as you may find you are not alone in feeling hemmed in. Even if you can’t set out on an exciting trip to get out of your routine, it might relax you to look at pictures from past travel or dream about where you would like to go in the future. There are no limits within your mind.","Your mood is deep today and you're eager to explore serious issues, but you might find it hard to bring your intensity to your larger community without stepping on people’s toes. Even if you are just trying to be yourself, you can’t please everyone. If you want to avoid drama -- which can be a big ""if"" for you, Leo -- you might have to withdraw into your work. You could get a lot done if you stay focused on practical matters.","You are proud of your ability to be reliable for your family, your friends, your career, and more. Today, though, you might find that the most important obligations in your life pull you in conflicting directions. No matter how hard you try, you cannot be in two places at once and someone will be disappointed. The way out of your dilemma may require answering one big question, even if only to yourself: Where are you in all of this?","Beware that work gossip could get way out of hand today -- bringing real politics into office politics will blow sky high. Yes, it can be exciting to be the one getting the group riled up with spicy intel, especially if you're bored with your home life, but there are healthier and more effective ways of satisfying yourself. Directing your energy into your home to transform it into a more nourishing environment will get you better, deeper results than idle chit-chat.","You have a gift for building transformative unions that can reach a spiritual level -- the harder part is continuing your ongoing existence as a separate human being. One of your collaborations might be overwhelming to you at this time. This is a good day for you to focus on articulating your side of the story at least to yourself, even if you are not ready to talk it out yet. Especially if money is involved in this relationship, you might need to figure out clearer boundaries.","Your close relationships could challenge you today, but it might be that your battle is not with the other person as much as it is with yourself. If you feel dependent on the other person, you might resent that. Talking it out is hard, though, so you pick fights about anything but that. Refreshing your memory of the resources you do have as an individual could help you feel more secure. You have plenty to contribute, and not only money counts.","Although you have been getting a lot done at work lately, you might be dragging today as your hidden resentment comes to the surface. People can sometimes take you for granted because you are known for your commitment to duty, but you ultimately need to feel valued as an individual just as much as anyone else does. Being vulnerable enough to talk to anyone about this might be the last thing you want to do, but it could make you feel better.","It doesn’t take a lot to set you off today. You'll find you are more emotional than usual on social media and you know exactly how to make whoever triggers you feel really bad. You might think you are just doing what you need to do to assert yourself or defend your values, but are you acting in line with your values in the moment? Taking quiet time for reflection may help you figure out what is really the best way to honor your values and integrity.","A need to escape tension could lead you to find relief in a ""third place"" today, as in, an environment separate from your home and your workplace. It will be hard for you to win when your family and professional worlds come into conflict with each other -- all they seem to agree on is that you are letting them down. You will be better off focusing your energy on neutral turf like a hobby or an online community where you can get caught doing something right."
2021-04-03,"We awake with our heads in a fog as the dreamy Moon forms a difficult square with mental Mercury early on. But the Moon enters the practical sign of Capricorn shortly after, and this push toward focus will help us tie up the loose ends of whatever has been on our minds over the last few weeks. Then, at 11:41 pm EDT, Mercury makes its way into pioneering Aries, ushering in new ways of thinking and fresh forms of inspiration.","Whether you have been wrestling or snuggling with your personal demons, Aries, your mental focus has been turned inward lately. Today is a good day to try to make philosophical sense of the hidden turmoil in your life. Can it become something that supports your ambitions? You may not be able to solve all of your problems for good in one day, but clarify what you can, because you may soon need to make your understanding of your identity more public.","After all the networking and connecting you've been doing recently, you will soon be craving some serious ""me"" time. For the moment, though, go all out and embrace the last bit of friendly, interactive energy that's being gifted to you. Your friendships crave not just presence but also intellectual challenge today, so you might invite a friend to learn something new with you in an online class. This could also be a good day to explore a spiritual community you have been curious about.","Although you like to keep things light, you may have had to think through some heavy issues about your professional direction and life purpose over the last few weeks. Today, a situation where you are collaborating or pooling your resources with others may remind you that, regardless of how you feel about your career at this point, it does help you afford the things that really matter to you. Keeping this perspective may defuse any tension you still feel about what you should be doing with your life.","Your intellectual life has had a boost recently and you may have found yourself simply enjoying a good book or philosophical tangent without worrying about how it will benefit your life in the long term. Now, though, you are starting to wonder how your recent explorations can support your larger ambitions. Talking things over with a trusted confidant can help you sort things out. Although they may seem to be pushing you, you want to know where things are going, too.","You have been having some intense experiences as of late and at least some of them were probably fun, but now it is time to settle down and create some space. Whether or not you really intend to travel anywhere, you might try clearing the decks like you would if you were about to go away on a trip for a couple of weeks. Pay your bills and take care of any paperwork that is just sitting around. You will at least think more clearly after that.","You have been applying your intellect toward solving the problems of others in your life lately, and this is something that comes easily for you. Today, though, you are getting nudged to focus on yourself and maybe even have a little fun, and these things are harder for you. You might be afraid that you won’t like what you see if you look inward, but your powerful mind is more competent than you think at solving your own mysteries. Dare to look behind the curtain.","It seems like everything has needed maintenance over the last few weeks -- your body, your car, your technology... Now, just when the end of your to-do list finally seems to be in sight, a family member might add one more thing to it, and the resulting frustration could challenge your normally even keel. As much as you like to look competent, asking someone for help could get your tasks done sooner. It could also strengthen your relationship with that person.","So far you have been able to put off your spring cleaning to play, but you are starting to see responsibilities looming in your future. Therefore, go all out today in an effort to enjoy yourself. Invite the people around you to try a new game with you or, if you feel more outdoorsy, see what is going on at your neighborhood park. The enjoyment you allow yourself today will help to balance and prepare you for the work that is on its way.","Your binge of domestic activity might finally be slowing down. You often have faith that things will work out, and having a home environment where energy flows smoothly increases the likelihood of this happening. If you ran up a big credit card bill doing some really cool stuff around the house recently, though, this might be a good day to sit down and plan how to pay it off. At the same time, take pride in what you have created.","You love a good project, especially one that leaves a lasting impact. The past few weeks have been full of their share of errands and chatter, but now you are ready to sink your teeth into something that will be a better use of your focus and determination. Today, start thinking about what could make your living space a greater reflection of your own personal energy -- with the amount of time you spent here, it should be a place that rejuvenates, nourishes, and inspires you.","This appears to be a quiet, reflective day for you, Aquarius. It's possible this is due to a money matter that's stressing you out, but dragging others into it will make it more dramatic than it needs to be. This is because you, yourself, probably see the situation with more drama than it warrants and would, therefore, portray it to them that way. Try to work things out on your own as much as you can and you may find that the answers are already within you.","You thrive in situations of togetherness and you can be extraordinarily selfless, yet recent events have pushed you to remember that even you have a separate, individual self. Spending time with your community in whatever safe way you can will help you to integrate new insights about your personal identity. Even if some things have changed for you, seeing that you still have a role in the groups and associations that are important to you can help you come to peace with that."
2021-04-04,"People are pushed together today as the emotional Moon forms dynamic squares with both the vibrant Sun and relationship-focused Venus. Some may be in touch for the Easter holiday, but interacting with family and friends is likely no matter what our tradition. New or old connections may refresh our perspectives in a way that feels disruptive in the moment, but when the Moon makes a sextile to vast Neptune later in the day, we can assimilate what we have taken in.","Although it is easy for you to strike up conversations with new acquaintances, do you like your answer when the small talk moves on to, “So, what do you do?” You don't have to spill all of your professional frustrations to someone you just met, but you may want to reflect on them later in private. Tonight, you have a great ability to think through what might really be holding you back from achieving your ambitions.","Rocking the boat is not easy for a Taurus. Even though you are sometimes more exciting than your cautious reputation suggests, you have probably gotten used to hiding this side of yourself in plain sight -- you let it out in a way that allows you to maintain plausible deniability. Today, though, things that you prefer to keep concealed may become too obvious to deny. Still, others’ reactions to whatever you think is too scandalous to share may not be as bad as you imagine.","While your chatty and social nature is on full display today, you are torn between the desire for light and happy conversation and the urge to delve deeper. As gifted as you are at communication, even you may find it hard to bring up tough topics without causing drama. It doesn’t make you superficial if you choose to hold back and stay on the surface -- save your most penetrating insights for reflecting on your personal ambitions later, when you are alone.","The universe is conspiring to make you look good today as ambiguous situations will generally be interpreted in your favor. Still, you may be worried about the potential for conflict with others, especially in a situation where your religious or philosophical beliefs differ. If you want to evade trouble, just be vague on the topic. This may feel stifling, but you can at least get away with it. Stay focused on maintaining your relationships with those people as humans.","You would like to broaden your horizons today, but getting out the door could be hard. You might have been looking forward to going on a little trip, yet details like putting gas in the car and packing food could interfere with the fun of it, especially if you left them until the last minute. You prefer to focus on things that are exciting, but you will ultimately experience more pleasure if you take care of the practical matters first.","Surprises may be in store for you today regarding money that you share with someone else, either in a professional or personal relationship. If relationships themselves have been confusing for you lately, tangible assets like money or property that are shared between you may be easier for you to get a handle on. You can idealize a person to the point that you have no idea what is really going on with them, but you, of all people, know that a bank statement does not lie.","You may choose to ignore your to-do list and just focus on people today, and that's perfectly fine -- the dynamics of others will give you plenty to focus on, whether you are attracting new relationships or enjoying the ones you already have. Still, you might have to take care of family responsibilities before you pursue an exciting new connection, or a close relationship might be drawing you in a direction your family is uncomfortable with. Patience will be needed.","You have a wonderful ability to make things beautiful today, Scorpio. Your ego needs are not strong at the moment, so you can look at the world around you and see the holes that need to be filled. It might seem like you are focused on things that are petty or inconsequential, but details that are done well will spark joy. You can give people in your life moments that inspire them to say “Wow, cool!” when they see or experience something creative and new.","You are looking for some fun today and you're up for anything that sounds exciting, even if it isn’t really in your budget. As always, lottery games are not intended for investment purposes, yet you have faith that things will work out somehow, and you might be right. But riches may also come to you in other forms -- though the people you interact with today may not be related to you by blood or marriage, they might feel like family anyway.","Today you seem more emotional than usual in the context of your family. This may not be a bad thing -- there could be happy tears. If you are upset, though, people may actually acknowledge that you have a point, because they know they take you for granted. Although unclear communication may contribute to setting you off in the first place, being a little vague intentionally could be part of the solution. Not everything that is true needs to be said.","You may get a thrill today by receiving a message out of the blue from someone unexpected. Whether it’s an old acquaintance or a mysterious stranger, you'll probably want to keep the excitement to yourself for a while. Don’t get so caught up in the excitement that you lose your ability to make good decisions, though. There is a risk you might end up manipulated for your money, so take things slow and try to get this person to be clear about their intentions.","You have the rare ability to shapeshift your identity, which gives you a broad social circle, because you have a little bit in common with a lot of different people. Today, be open to the possibility of a financial opportunity coming to you through your friends or acquaintances -- maybe from someone you would not expect. But while you could be tempted to impulsively go for it, you still need to use good judgment when evaluating this opportunity."
2021-04-05,"We may begin the day in an emotional rut as the sensitive Moon unites with intense Pluto in controlling Capricorn in the early morning hours. Our problems could feel unsolvable, but after the Moon enters objective Aquarius at 9:04 am EDT, we start to be able to think our way out. Connecting with others to get perspective is favored once the Moon makes a sextile to communicative Mercury. Burdens are lightened when shared, and also burdens are lightened when aired.","Authority issues might weigh heavily on you today. A parental figure -- or maybe a boss who has that vibe -- could seem controlling. It may help you to reach out to a friend or even read the archives of your favorite advice blog to get an outside perspective on what is typical behavior in this situation. You do not have to aspire to be normal for the sake of being normal, but this can help to guide your actions and reactions.","You are rethinking your capacity for spiritual connection now. You might have been held back by your experiences, past or present, with a religious institution that used control instead of genuine, authoritative guidance. Now, you'll need to become your own authority figure in this realm. Your practical nature as a Taurus will help you with this, as it gives you the ability to look at the concrete results of different approaches and see which ones lead to functional outcomes. You are the one to decide what aligns with your life and soul.","You may need to figure out how an emotionally intense experience you had recently fits into your larger, intellectual understanding of the world. Emotions are sometimes not your comfort zone, but talking things out generally makes you feel better. It is good that you have the ability to strike up a conversation with just about anyone, because an acquaintance who doesn’t know you very well may have a fresher perspective on your situation than your close friends who are already in too deep.","If a close relationship feels controlling or smothering, the answer, paradoxically, may be seeking more intimacy. There seems to be too much focus on how well one or both of you are meeting the expectations of the ""partner"" or ""friend"" job description. Try connecting with each other as humans instead. It is also possible that a parental relationship is influencing this situation; are you repeating a dynamic that you had or saw with your parents in the past? These patterns run deep, but your actions are still up to you.","You enjoy work and routine less than others to begin with, but today, the drudgery could feel downright oppressive. Pursuing intellectual stimulation like a thoughtful book or movie could at least give you a window out. Afterward, discussing whatever you learn with a close friend or partner could even strengthen the relationship. You are sometimes perceived as self-centered, but one of the hardest parts about responsibilities for you is actually the way they isolate you from others. Make a point to stay connected.","The child in you may have emerged as a way to balance some of life's responsibility, but now it has gotten too powerful and is too aggressively telling you what to do. To find balance, you might need to intentionally focus on adult matters. You could start with the bills and chores, but that is pretty much how you got into this predicament. Try to move on to the more sensual side of adulthood at some point -- kids don't actually get ALL the fun.","The responsibilities of family life seem to be weighing you down now. What you really need is a date night or a good hangout with a close friend to remind you that there is more to you than what you provide to your loved ones. While you may get satisfaction from knowing that you are the rock in your family, balance is truly necessary, and you need to feel valued for who you are as an individual, too.","It is easy for you to get caught up in the drama of the people around you today. Stuff like that can be a fun chew toy for your penetrating intellect, and it does not require you to be as vulnerable as solving your own problems might. However, focusing on taking care of your own responsibilities, both domestic and professional, can be grounding, and you will see you are very capable of getting things done. Start small and watch your progress grow.","Money issues might be stressing you out, but how are you thinking about them? The root of a financial leak you cannot seem to stop may have something to do with how you think or communicate about finances. You especially may need to examine your views on luck. It is fine to believe that good fortune can happen, but you may be using this concept as a way to shield yourself from responsibility for the results of your own decisions. In the end, your fortune is what you make it.","You are coming across as especially intense to others today. Even if that isn’t what you intend, there may not be much you can do to convince them otherwise. You will be better off focusing on things that have a tangible and visible outcome that can be judged on its own merits, rather than on what anybody thinks of you personally. Organizing financial data would be one option, as would cleaning up around the house. Give yourself a real, noticeable win.","It may be hard for you to figure out why you have been feeling more emotional than usual lately. After the Moon goes into your sign this morning, though, you can make some progress toward articulating whatever has been hard to pin down. Talking things out with someone else can help you clarify things, but this is more of an issue within yourself than a relationship problem with anyone else, so journaling could be a substitute. Let your thoughts flow and see where they lead.","The groups you belong to in your community or on social media might be making you crazy, especially if even the people you agree with are trying to impose rigid standards. It may be that you would like to see more empathy for situations where there are exceptions to the rules, or you could be so passionate about your group’s ideals that others are trying to set boundaries on your emotional displays. Step away from the drama for now and take time alone to reflect on what you really value."
2021-04-06,"We are in an extroverted mood today as the sky sings in three-part harmony. The centerpiece is a sextile between passionate Venus and assertive Mars at 7:18 am EDT that boosts our confidence and charm. As the day goes on, the sociable Moon dances with both Venus and Mars, and this trifecta strengthens relationships of all kinds, but it also supports taking action. There is less conflict than usual between what we want and how we go about getting it, so this is the time to go for it!","You look and feel good today, and the people around you are eager and willing to build on whatever you do or say. Seize this opportunity to state your piece. Don't allow the fear of being misunderstood to hold you back, because people will generally hear you accurately at this time. If they need to debate what you have said further, they will at least be debating what you actually said instead of what they imagined you said.","You are motivated to pursue money in your career, and you now have the force on your side to succeed at raking in the bucks. Your attachment to your professional calling actually does go deeper than the financial rewards, but let people imagine that you are shallow if they must. You are better off keeping your heart secret for now. You can still bring that energy of love into what you do, but speaking up about it might ruin the magic.","Communication and information are your specialties and you are really on fire today, especially when it comes to social media. You might not meet a meme you can stop yourself from forwarding. If you want to take initiative on your own behalf and actually write a solid post about what you personally have been thinking and doing lately, though, it will go over nicely. You are well-equipped now to assert your individuality in a way that does not provoke conflict with others.","You may feel blocked against taking action on your own behalf today, but this could turn out to be a good thing. The people in power are on your side, and if you wait for them to intervene in your favor, they might do a more effective job getting things moving for you than you would be able to do for yourself, even in a best-case scenario. They also know that helping you is part of the responsibility of their role, so don’t feel bad about accepting their assistance.","Relationships with people near and far are favored today, but the faraway ones may be more rewarding. You might even connect over the Internet with someone in or from another country, and this person could be very helpful to you, though you should take care to be sensitive to their sore spots that differ from your own. You are not on an offensive streak, but the experience of working hard to be aware of someone else’s different perspective will strengthen all your relationships, including those closer to home.","Your excellence in executing the day-to-day details of your work is recognized, and you may be given greater responsibility at your workplace. Even if you are only put in charge of locking up the building at the end of the day, you can be proud of becoming a more trusted figure. Still, you are able to glimpse your larger career path, and it is itching to move forward. Instead of trying to make a major change, consider all the opportunities you have right now to bloom where you are planted.","You are both beautiful and brilliant today, Libra. Though you are often tempted to conform in relationships, which sometimes results in downplaying how intelligent you are, your intellectual drive is now working harmoniously with your capacity to connect. You are able to share your insights with others without intimidating them. When you can express your whole self without holding back as much as you usually do, your fun and free side emerges. Your delightful wit makes being smart look easy and enticing.","Your day-to-day tasks feel like less of a burden than usual today, which frees you up to dive into the sort of deeper inquiry that is more your strength. You can get to the bottom of significant issues surrounding your home or family now. The root cause of the problem may be that boundaries between people have gotten confused, especially if the disputed turf is not well-defined. You are equipped to help adjust the boundaries if needed and gently guide each party into their proper place.","Today revolves around an important relationship in your life, and while you can talk things out if you have to, it may be more important for the two of you to just have fun together to get out some excess energy. As intellectual as you are, you also have a strong physical side that needs to be expressed. Active sports or even a brisk walk outdoors would make you feel less edgy and also facilitate bonding. Not all of the communication in this relationship has to be verbal.","You know that the greatest rewards come when you put in effort, so while you want a beautiful home, you do not have the illusion that it will be handed to you for free. Today, you have the strength to put in sweat equity on whatever you are doing to fix up your digs. If you have to spend money on supplies or on hiring others to help, you will feel that you got a fair deal. Whatever you put in, you will get even more out in return.","You have the strength to assert yourself today if you need to. More importantly, you have the ability to state your case kindly -- you can get your point across without trampling the sensitivities of others or provoking them to feel that they are being personally attacked. Individuality is not like a pie, where giving more to one person means that there is less left over for everyone else. You can stand up for your rights in a way that supports the rights of others, too.","Your carefully curated possessions make your home a nurturing environment, which is especially important for someone like you, as staying grounded in the material world can be difficult. Physical items in your surroundings may be easier for you to relate to and keep track of than intangible figures in a bank account. Focus on your space today and the way it makes you feel. When your home acts as a base of security and comfort, it gives you the strength to pursue your most cherished dreams."
2021-04-07,"What starts as an exciting day gives way to calming reflection. This morning buzzes with energy as the Moon meets optimistic Jupiter in social Aquarius at 6:05 am EDT. We are in a good mood and interested in sharing it with others. We may not be terribly disciplined or focused, but fun is just what we need now. New connections we develop over a shared laugh might even become important later. The giggling settles down once the Moon moves into Pisces, and we can finally relax for the evening.","You know how to have good-natured fun and get others to participate in it, and you can do that on a big scale today by turning to social media. You might even go viral if your quick wit harmonizes with the collective mood just right. By evening, though, you will have discharged your social battery. It can sometimes be hard for you to relax, but when you get yourself this worn out, you should have no problem getting a rejuvenating rest.","The hard work you have been putting toward your career is finally recognized today. You know you have been doing a good job, but it is nice to hear that validated by other people. Afterward, broadcasting your professional news on social media could increase the rewards you get from it even further. People are drawn to your success and want to find ways to collaborate with you. The right connections will flow smoothly, and it is possible to establish those connections now.","Your intellectual life is at a peak now and you just might find a book that will change your life. Sometimes the right book finds you, but if you have to hunt one down yourself, professional development would be a good literary genre for you to pursue. Whatever frustration you are having in your career at the moment, someone else has probably had the same problem. You can learn from their experience and apply their insights to solving your own challenges.","You might learn a juicy secret today, but this knowledge comes to you in a way that is hard for you to process. Maybe you get more of a physical sensation or a vibe than actual written or spoken words. Still, your curiosity will be provoked enough that you'll want to find a more intellectual way to understand and articulate what you learned. Stick with it, because the rewards of this quest could last longer than just solving the mystery of the moment.","Close relationships of all kinds feel good today, and you are ready to go to the next level with a person who is important to you. It's a good thing you aren't in the mood to keep this a secret, because it looks like other people may also become aware of your special connection. If you have been developing a professional collaboration, for example, it might be time to fill out paperwork to make your business partnership official. The world will celebrate with you.","You can rock it at work today, so don’t feel bad about taking a break to help yourself to a treat or reward. All the parts of your life are connected, and being proud of your professional performance will help you feel less stressed in your close relationships as well. In fact, you may come to realize that some of the problems in your relationships may really be problems with how you feel about yourself. Allow yourself a reward now, whether or not you think you earned it.","You can have a lot of fun and just be playful today. Sometimes you are concerned about how other people see you, but this is a day to focus on whatever is the most entertaining to you personally, no matter how quirky it is. You know you can’t let loose like this every day, but times like this refresh your spirit so that, when you do have to settle down and get back to work, you don’t feel martyred about it.","Home is a comfortable and nurturing space for you today, and the benefits of this extend far beyond just feeling cozy in the moment. When you have a home base this secure, you have the foundation to grow into the best version of yourself that you can share with the world. Then, of course, you make the world better. In the event your home life is not fulfilling, benefic Jupiter shining on this scene can help to draw you out of a bad situation.","Routine errands could turn exciting, especially if they lead you to explore an unfamiliar corner of your city. Although you probably have not been able to pursue the sort of big trips you really like lately, you might have overlooked treasures hiding in plain sight. What you find now can engage your emotions and give you a fuller appreciation of why you call your city home. You may also meet friendly new acquaintances who grow into more significant connections over time.","A positive shift will have you feeling optimistic on many levels today. You may receive good news about a money matter, which can kick off a relaxing evening of conversation with those around you. While you are capable of appreciating hard work for its own sake, your current bounty more likely comes from others recognizing your efforts and appreciating you. It may be hard to admit that you care about things like that, but your heart is warm.","People are starting to notice you, which is a little strange because you have been here all along. You are willing to welcome them to your world now, though, and even if you don't admit it too effusively, being seen feels really good. When you feel good about yourself, it is easier to look at everything else in your life in a constructive way. If a financial matter has been nagging you for a while, it could be easier to tackle now with your newfound confidence.","A special secret has you smiling today. Something big is going in your favor, but you may not feel it is the right time to share your news with others -- you may not even be able to explain the story very well to yourself. Whatever it is, it gives you the strength to move forward knowing that you have support behind you. Although the people who are on your side may also want their privacy now, you have the sense to honor that."
2021-04-08,"Change comes easily today as the emotional Moon makes a calm sextile to revolutionary Uranus at 10:24 am EDT. We may not be taking on anything enormous, but the little things are running smoothly enough that we have the space to optimize them to run even better. Minor frustrations that have been bothering us for a while may also get resolved, sometimes in surprising ways. The Pisces Moon helps to keep things peaceful through it all, and blesses us with intuition to catch what has gotten lost in the shuffle.","It is easy to notice the things that go wrong in life, but you don’t always see the things that go right. It's likely that a secret benefactor will help you financially today, and you might not even know that it happened. When you pay a bill, for example, you may not think about it much more, but a billing clerk you never meet could have an eagle eye that catches an error on your behalf. Be diligent and careful, but have faith that the universe has your back.","Your sense of self has been shifting lately, as much as you are known for your resistance to change. You will be relieved, however, to find out that others have an easier time dealing with change than you do, so if you share a new side of yourself in your larger community today, people will generally roll with it. These changes may feel major to you so you think they will be major to others, when in fact, people may not be too fazed by them at all.","You have had a lot of strange and innovative ideas lately that seem to come out of nowhere -- sometimes they shock even you. Today, though, one of your brainstorms could actually help you sort out a thorny problem in your career. You might worry about being seen as an oddball, but you will find you can communicate this insight in a way that does not alarm people. Those whose reaction you are worried about are more open to change than you imagine.","You are craving some intellectual stimulation and may be inclined to discuss a book or documentary you enjoyed on social media to broaden the conversation. If you get excessive pushback, this may be a sign that a particular community you are part of is not a good fit for you now, even if it was in the past. Your people are out there, though, and clarifying your own philosophy is the best thing you can do at the moment to help yourself find them.","There's a shakeup happening for an authority figure in your life and you might discover that a boss, parent, or mentor is more vulnerable than you imagined. This person could rely on you more heavily today than you are used to. Although you love anything that gets you an extra bit of status, you may also suspect that you will never be regarded as an equal to them, no matter how much they need you now. Step up and share your strengths, knowing that you are powerful and capable anyway.","Your views on important topics have been in a state of flux lately, but the people closest to you may be left in the dark. Today, it's time to initiate a philosophical discussion in at least one of your close relationships, because you need to make sure that the two of you are still on the same page about the big things. Taking your relationship off of autopilot can reinvigorate it now, even if you discover that you have veered apart in some places.","You have the right mindset to work out some tough bureaucratic issues today. Sometimes technology makes submitting data and applications easier, and sometimes the online form resets itself and you have to fill out everything again, just when you were almost done. In situations like this, you are able to stay calm, and that is the biggest part of the battle. Have faith that there is an underlying method to the madness of this administrative soup, and that your natural inclination toward order will help you align with it.","Someone you are close to may seem to be changing in a way that is hard for you to deal with. Transformation comes naturally to you, Scorpio, but you are used to your partners and friends being the ones who stay the same. Now, it may upset you more than you would expect to have them beating you at your own game. It may help you to focus on yourself instead and see if you have any changes brewing -- no one can compete with you for too long.","You have been riding waves of change in your work life lately, and have maybe even adopted a new wellness regimen that meshes better with your new schedule. With all of this going on for you, though, have you been taking your home life for granted? Check in today with whoever you live with and make sure you have not handled their needs unfairly in the process of figuring out the routine that works best for you. Peace in all areas of your life tends to start at home.","You are starting to realize the benefits of fun and freedom. In the past, maybe you ignored playtime entirely, given your serious nature, but now, you may be more open to the idea. What will work best for you is something that fits into your routine. Mobile games or newspaper puzzles might be about the right size for your time slots, but it is most important for you to have something where you can see your progress over time; you still want that feeling of accomplishment.","The structure of your home has been getting overhauled lately. There might be physical changes like a renovation, but there might also be metaphorical changes like expanding your idea of the boundaries of what counts as your home and your family. Whether or not you have financial bills from hardware stores and contractors, this might be a good time to think about the costs of your recent reforms. With everything that has shifted, are you still living in line with your basic values?","The way you communicate with others is really a part of your identity. You might see yourself as the one in any group who makes the wittiest wisecracks or the one who uses the most emojis in texts. But while it is nice to have a personal style to hold on to, it's possible your quirky ways actually interfere with you being able to get your point across. Think about who you would be without this, and if you might benefit from trying out a new approach."
2021-04-09,"We are prone to land on each other’s sore spots today. It starts when inquisitive Mercury meets touchy Chiron at 3:08 am EDT, then the mayhem intensifies as aggressive Mars challenges long-suffering Neptune with a provocative square in the afternoon. We'll manage to offend each other in every way imaginable. When the Moon finally reaches a stabilizing sextile with perceptive Pluto in the evening, there is at least an opportunity to calm down from the drama and try to make some sense of it.","You may be aggressive in your communication today, and feel entirely justified in unloading on others in that way because you feel personally wounded and victimized. Your wounds might go much further back than whoever is in your path at the moment, though. It could help you to take a fresh look at the powerful people who hurt you in the past. As important and influential as they were at the time, maybe the world has moved on from them, and you can too.","You may feel the need to defend your values today. It would be wise, however, to take a step back and consider your longtime philosophical opponents. Upsetting things that they said years ago may still ring in your head, but you know that you have grown and changed a lot since then. Other people grow too, though their shifts may not look quite the same as yours. Check to see whether you are warring against someone who no longer exists in real life.","Something you see in the world today could trigger old wounds about separating from your family. How can you be an independent person and pursue your own path without hurting the people who are determined to hold on to you? The idea of enmeshment attempts to enforce closeness by annihilating the boundaries between people, while intimacy -- the deeper connection -- comes from separate individuals freely choosing to reveal themselves to each other. You may need to look into trading enmeshment for intimacy in these relationships.","You have reached your limit with social structures that are rigid, rule-based, and authoritarian. Replacing all that with a philosophy of infinite gentleness and nurturing toward others could definitely be more appealing. However, even the most perfect philosophy can end up forcing people into a mold that they don’t always fit. You are better off just trying to interact with each person you encounter today as the individual they are instead of running your relationships through the filter of your idealistic vision.","You may be tempted to spill on social media or to a group of friends about a problem that's happening in your personal life. With your emotions inflamed, though, you'll have trouble describing the situation accurately. You would be better off reflecting in private on what is upsetting you until you feel calmer and clearer. The answers you need will take time to emerge, so ground yourself in your practical routine to avoid trouble until that happens.","Relationships may have been messy for you lately, because it's been hard for you to see the other person accurately. Even bad news could come as a relief, since at least you'd be getting objective information. In this way, today you might learn about how someone in your life has been handling money or other resources that you share with them. If you are disappointed by what you discover, you may have to take your own path forward, because you can’t control their actions, only your own.","Work feels devouring today, and you may be sucked in by someone’s claim that they have lofty motives for pushing you around. This person speaks with such authority that you'll have to force yourself to remember that they are just a human being that you have a relationship problem with. If this dynamic feels common in your life, spend some time reflecting on your family and background. Envision what being treated with respect would look like for you.","It can be hard to pin down the answer to the question of what you should really be doing with your life. The humdrum routine of the day may provoke you to wonder if you should be fulfilling your potential in some more dramatic way. If you feel like you have failed, talking or journaling about these concerns can help you see whether or not they are reasonable. When you put all the facts on paper, it may become apparent that you have accomplished more than you think.","You could feel undervalued as an individual today, as the drama of your family and close relationships overwhelms you. Where are you in all of this, and how did you get caught in the middle of such a turbulent bunch of people? You might be able to restore order, at least within yourself, by focusing on the resources you have. Material goods shouldn’t substitute for relationships on an ongoing basis, but they could bring comfort today in a moment of chaos.","This could be a frustrating day for you where your carefully planned habits and routines hit snag after snag. Unfortunately, home is no retreat from this, because you are also feeling that your hard work there is not valued. You may need to focus on getting in touch with yourself: not the identity that you have cobbled together from external signifiers like your family, duties, and career, but the identity that is greater than the sum of your parts.","You may be tempted to take a financial risk today, but be cautious, because you are not seeing money accurately. Find someone who can tell you the truth, even if it hurts. There may be more to your financial issues than the opportunity that is currently stirring things up for you, but you need to get the facts of the immediate provocation sorted out before you delve into your deeper motivations. You may ultimately need to explore a compulsive behavior, though.","You may seize power at home or in your family today by portraying yourself as a victim. This could be especially tempting to you if you have doubts about your ability to contribute to the group in a more productive way. People tend to be afraid to challenge a victim, so you might get what you want in the short term, whether or not you should. Ultimately, you will be better off getting outside input, like from a favorite advice blog, on healthier ways of interacting."
2021-04-10,"We are drawn toward pleasure but may wind up with pain today. Hedonistic Venus makes a harmonious sextile with bountiful Jupiter at 2:53 pm EDT, motivating us to be social, but the fun hits snags as the emotional Moon meets wounded Chiron. Connecting with people might remind us there were reasons why we had been taking some space. Fortunately, intellectual Mercury's sextile with serious Saturn helps us think through how to communicate without hurting others and get our true needs met.","You may feel drawn to open up about an emotionally painful matter today. Social media could be an appropriate outlet, because you sense that this problem is much bigger than your own personal experience; you have tapped into something that needs to heal in the larger collective. You must work to state your case thoughtfully, but you will ultimately get a positive reception. Others may feel validated by hearing your story and then gain the confidence to share their own stories.","Ambition has been a real push-and-pull situation for you lately. You are moving ahead toward your goals, but you also seem to be held back. Therefore, you may need to uncover your subconscious blocks against professional achievement. This could turn out to involve difficulty accepting yourself as an authority figure. Even if someone else seems to be causing trouble for you, the problem is more strongly within yourself. If you can show people a confident attitude, they will generally go along with it.","You can be a real champion for your view of the world in public today. However, the challenge of having your philosophy on display is that its problems will also be identified and debated. Whatever the source of your dogma may be, what the people you interact with notice the most is how you execute it in real life. You will look bad if you are wounding or excluding others, so make an effort to focus on the most generous version of your viewpoint possible.","You may be making progress toward your professional goals, but it does not always feel good. When you become more visible, you might get inundated with more offers than you have the ability to accept. It is true that life can be more peaceful when you keep your head down, and your sensitive soul hates to hurt people by telling them no. However, you may have to say no a few times before you can say yes to what you really want.","You may become aware of cultural or worldview differences in one of your close relationships. It is better if you try to see these challenges coming instead of blundering into them by accident, but sometimes you can’t see these things until they happen. If you and the other person struggle to find common ground between your two ways of life, you might try exploring a third way together to revitalize your relationship. The neutral turf could give you the space you need to work out your issues.","You are able to work hard on practical matters and get to the bottom of things today. However, there may be some disappointment about what you find, like if it turns out that someone you are involved with has not been entirely forthright about money matters. Bringing the situation to light is the first step toward resolving it. The bigger issue you need to sort out may not even be whatever happened with the money, but rather, the shame that fueled the secrecy about the situation.","You need to be clear about expectations to minimize hurt feelings in your friendships and other relationships today. With your agreeable nature, you can unintentionally lead people on so that they expect more than you intend to give. You may have a desire to keep things light, while the other person wants a deeper commitment. Alternately, you could be the one trying to tie someone else down. It’s not wrong for people to want different things, but the first step to getting what you want is being honest about it.","You may be feeling under the weather today, perhaps from indulging too much or overdoing it working on projects around the house. With your passionate nature, you want to do everything all at once. You also have a strong, competitive spirit and love to best any challenge. If you slow down, though, you might actually get more pleasure out of your activities. You have all the time you need to take care of your responsibilities, so spread them out at a manageable pace.","Watch what you say today. You definitely have a jolly side, but it is easy for fun to cross the line into hurting someone, because your words aren't coming out as you intend right now. Just focus on your philosophical side, since it seems you are going to be taken seriously whether you want to be or not. Instead of trying to be the entertainer, articulate a more analytical take on entertainment and pleasure. There's more power in a deeper, thoughtful approach.","You've given a lot of energy to your home and family lately, but other parts of your life need attention, too. You may need to rethink your priorities today when it comes to how you spend your resources. The cold, hard numbers you gravitate toward can be the basis of your thinking, but you'll have to translate them into more human terms to communicate your decisions to other people involved. Make an effort to handle things so that no one feels slighted.","You're in the process of understanding and expanding who you are, yet you might need to define yourself as a separate person first. You are so social that you can easily accumulate a lot of routine chatter with the people around you. If you don’t get enough time alone, though, stress will eventually set in. The problem is not these people, but the way you approach their role in your life. It may be time to get clear about your boundaries with them.","Focusing on money may have something in it for you today, even if you don’t normally like to focus on money matters. If you feel like you are too cool or too spiritual to be interested in the financial realm, you might need to examine why -- you could be holding outdated ideas that prevent you from reaching your full potential. Even if you feel a calling to serve others, it does not do them any good for you to have trouble taking care of yourself."
2021-04-11,"Our energy is high today and we have the opportunity for a fresh start. The Moon meets intellectual Mercury in the morning, helping us gather clarity on our intentions. The centerpiece of the day, however, is the powerful New Moon in Aries at 10:31 pm EDT, which gives us a renewed burst of initiative. We are empowered to pursue our desires, though a tense square between persuasive Venus and manipulative Pluto forces us to consider the hidden costs of what we want.","You have a renewed sense of personal identity today. You are more articulate than usual about who you are and what matters to you, and you would like to share this with the world. The only thing holding you back might be your concern about the reaction of a more traditional professional environment. Take another look at the people you think would take it badly, though, because you are not the only person who has lived through changing times lately.","You have been thinking through life’s big questions lately, but a breakthrough could come to you when you don’t expect it, like in a dream while you are sleeping. Many people imagine they want this sort of experience, but it can actually disrupt your life if you are involved in an educational, spiritual, or professional community that is very attached to their particular view of the world. You don’t have to share your insights immediately, so let them ripen until you are ready.","Your phone and social media accounts may be blowing up with notifications today, and the attention feels good. However, the type of public attention that comes from revealing your personal world comes with costs. Make sure that you can live with whatever choice you make -- and, also, be careful not to make this choice on behalf of anyone else. Be mindful of others’ boundaries so that you only share stories that are entirely yours to share. You have more than enough to say about yourself.","Your progress toward reaching your professional goals is reaching a high point. If you get the sense that someone you have a close relationship with feels lost in the shuffle of your exciting developments, you need to address it with them directly. You may not be able to give them everything they want, but whatever their issue is, it is better to air it now than to find yourself sabotaged by their sulking indefinitely. Just hearing them out may relieve the tension.","You would love to get out and see the world, but practical matters have been holding you back. Today, you might be able to work out a plan to add smaller, more achievable chunks of exploration to your daily routine. You cannot focus exclusively on your responsibilities; you need more excitement in your life to refuel your fire. If you are not able to travel physically, then a mental journey, like catching up on your reading list, could get you feeling like yourself again.","You may be interested in merging resources within a personal or business collaboration, as you see the possibilities for your duo becoming greater than the sum of its parts. In the excitement of the moment, though, it might be easy to forget that you do like to have your own creative freedom when you really need it. Read any paperwork you are signing closely, and make sure whatever you are agreeing to does not inhibit you more than you can honestly live with.","A budding relationship where you feel seen, heard, and valued has you excited. You definitely want to pursue it further. Whether this connection is personal or professional, however, it may not have the level of stability and security you are accustomed to in your life. The answer is not always as simple as following your heart no matter what. You are a master of compromise, though, so you may be able to work out a situation where you get the best of both worlds.","You have the energy and focus to get a lot of practical work done today. If others see you as incommunicado or antisocial, tell them that it’s nothing personal against them. Maybe it is a little bit personal on your end, though. You are such a perceptive observer of the people around you that it is easy for you to make their drama your own. To prevent your workload from piling this high in the future, you might need to mind your own business more.","You have finally made some progress toward a longtime creative goal of yours, and now you want to pursue it with full force. It may be hard for you to balance that with your other commitments, though. You are not inclined to compromise when you have found something you are passionate about. Just make sure you can support what you are doing with your own resources, as others will feel resentful if you coax them into taking on your burdens.","You can be the star in your family today. However, if your family doesn’t know the real you by now, you may feel resentful about being stuck in an outdated role. Change that creeps up over time can be hard to articulate for so long that, by the time you do get around to telling others, the delay in the news makes it awkward. It may be hard for you to open up, but loved ones can’t come in if you don’t let them.","Conversation is popping up all around you today. You might feel like the atmosphere of constant connection lacks depth, but you have not failed if you don’t get around to sharing your most complex visions of the world with every acquaintance you meet. Just enjoy casual company as a pleasant experience in the moment, and take in the wisdom of people you might have overlooked. You may hear a choice tidbit of information that inspires you on many levels.","You may finally reach the culmination of a financial goal today, and this milestone also enables you to see your next step forward. Do not post your accomplishment on social media or otherwise spread it too widely, though. Whatever motivates jealous haters is not really about you -- it could be as simple as hard times, which can bring out the worst in people. A run-in with one of these people will steal your good vibes, so enjoy your success in private."
2021-04-12,"The business week opens with money news. When the Moon meets Venus at 8:06 am EDT, our sense of emotional security is in harmony with our desire for pleasure. Heavy Pluto, however, challenges the Moon, demanding that we identify what we are willing to sacrifice in order to have all the good things -- they won’t come to us for free. As the Moon moves into Taurus in the afternoon, we get a sense of how to make a practical plan to move forward.","You may be seen as self-centered at work today, more committed to your own whims than to the group mission. Whether or not this is true, you will have the opportunity to prove your detractors wrong as you are called upon to handle an issue regarding money or property. If you can come through for your team and solve the problem, whatever complaints they have about your personal style will dissipate, as real achievement cuts through the murk of biased perceptions.","It may be hard to wake up from your sweet dreams today, yet the freedom of dreamland does not always translate well to the waking world, where people are tied to particular ideas of how things should go. You do have the opportunity to be more expressive in your interactions, though you don’t have to go fully surrealist. As the day goes on, what remains of your dreams is more of a vague sense, and that is about the right level of reverie to share with others.","Connecting with people feels good today, and it is comforting to see that people generally seem to think well of you. Charge your batteries with the positive vibes while you can, as you may soon need to draw back and turn your focus to more serious issues that do not provide such easy gratification. Quiet times might not be in your comfort zone, but your quick and clever mind can draw brilliant insights that would escape others when you take on the tough stuff.","You are likely feeling good about your current path in life and nurtured by your professional surroundings. Your close, personal relationships, however, may seem to lack that nurturing quality at this time; perhaps they are having trouble adjusting to a recent growth spurt in your ambition. Even if no one has done anything wrong, the tension may not resolve today. People just need time to adjust. Turning your attention toward less demanding connections like social media and community groups might relieve some pressure for now.","It is hard to balance your desire to broaden your horizons with the practical demands of life. If you can’t travel and see much of the world right now, can you see yourself in a better professional position? You might enjoy your responsibilities more if you could see that they were helping you to reach a larger goal. Spend some time figuring out your big picture so that you can fill in the details in a way that makes sense for it.","Strong feelings are pulling you toward fusion with someone else, though there is a part of you resisting the full merger you think you want. It might just be the reality that you will always be a separate person on some level, whether you like it or not. You want something grander than mere reality right now, though. Looking at your situation through a more philosophical lens might give you both the grandeur you seek and a way to stay grounded.","You are drawn toward a relationship that feels pleasant and emotionally nurturing. It might seem like an escape from the heaviness of your family's past, though old dynamics could follow you into this new connection if you are not careful. Your heart wants a transformative experience. A practical test for someone you are considering for this role is seeing whether your friend or loved one helps you with your burdens. That will be easy to spot if you are used to everything being all on you.","You can get emotional satisfaction from quietly taking care of your practical responsibilities today. These tasks seem to have a clear and achievable correct answer, which may feel easier at the moment than dealing with the frustrating ambiguities that come from communicating with other people. Whatever has shaken your confidence about human relationships will let up soon, so try to get as much work done as possible before the urge to reconnect strikes you.","You hate feeling tied down, so the thought of financial pressures pushing you to be serious just makes you want to withdraw into your fun all the more. If you actually dip your toe into the practical world, however, you might find it more enjoyable than you expect. You are a clever enough philosopher to understand there are different kinds of pleasure in life. Taking care of business might not be a rollicking ride, but it can awaken your physically sensuous side.","It is easy for you to hide behind the role of being your family’s rock in order to avoid addressing harder questions about your own identity. You may not even know where to start asking such questions. As overwhelming as the task of coming to understand yourself can feel, the first step might just be enjoying yourself. The things you find fun give unique clues to what makes you personally tick. Follow that trail of clues today like it’s your job.","Casual chatter is all around you today, and it may end up hitting one of your sore spots. No one is trying to set you off; the trigger might be something you wouldn’t even see coming yourself. You might just be burned out and in need of rest after being inundated with the perspectives of others. Fortunately, your home can be the calming environment that you need. Don’t feel bad about taking a nap if that appeals to you; rejuvenation will do you good.","You seem to be in a confident place financially for the moment. If you have a little extra, it might be time to spring for something special you’ve been eyeing in a favorite shop, whether online or in your neighborhood. The treat is not just the purchase itself, though, it's what comes with it. Even if you arrive with something specific in mind, you will also discover new things you did not know existed; you may even find something unexpected that makes your daily life a bit easier."
2021-04-13,"We are unsettled this morning as the Moon meets up with impulsive Uranus. It is hard to stick to our established plans for the day because surprises and disruptions are popping up from every corner. This becomes exhausting, especially as the Moon makes a stressful square to taskmaster Saturn in the afternoon. Thankfully, when the lively Sun forms a harmonious sextile with assertive Mars at 7:09 pm EDT, we recover our equilibrium and can take constructive action to move forward informed by whatever came to light today.","You have more going for you than you think you do. It can be hard for you to see that today because social groups may remind you of how you think you fall short, even if they do not intend to slight you. The action is going on inside your own head, where you could be tempted to make impulse purchases to show your worth and keep up with the Joneses. Take enough time alone to clearly hear your own perspective and your true needs.","If you are in a mood today, it may come from feeling stifled and unable to express yourself, especially if you are dealing with a restrictive professional environment. Someone who has been pushing you too hard for too long might have earned whatever pushback they get now. What will satisfy you more in the long run, however, is privately making progress toward your own financial goals. You will feel better if you can get a greater sense of control over your own life.","Provocation seems to come out of nowhere for you today, and you find yourself ready to fight over every little thing. You might feel that vague, shadowy forces far removed from you are holding you back in your life. However, your bigger problem might be that you have gotten too cooped up and isolated from the outside world. Your strong energy needs an outlet right now, so find a way to connect to something bigger than yourself.","You may be interested in engaging with acquaintances or friends who are more edgy than your usual crowd today. You are still your comfort-seeking self, though, and might be afraid that a walk on the wild side will somehow threaten the carefully crafted security of your life. While your fears of how your closer circle would react to your exploration may be overblown, it is okay to keep some things private for now if that makes you feel more comfortable.","An authority figure in your life, like a boss or a parent, may suddenly act unstable today. This outburst could lead to positive change in the long run, but if this person can’t recover well from the disruption in the moment, you may have to pick up the pieces. You need support too, so reach out to your close relationships for help staying grounded. Engaging with your larger community or philosophical tradition can also remind you that life is bigger than today’s drama.","It feels good to have someone on your side, as it looks like resources you share with at least one other person are currently helping you move toward your goals. You are accustomed to working hard all by yourself if you have to, but finally getting some support presents you with a new challenge: You don’t get to think of yourself as entirely unappreciated anymore. You might have to change your way of thinking about the world in order to accommodate this shift in your identity.","Relationships demand more than usual from you today, and the social skills you can normally rely on to get you out of any mess will not be enough by themselves. Don’t be afraid of an intellectual challenge in conversation -- if you stick with it, you can reach surprising insights that solve big mysteries. The fear of conflict could keep you from this pursuit, yet you may realize that the heavy atmosphere around you comes from too many things being left unsaid.","Your home or family life feels stifling right now, so you are tempted to just spill your guts into a wild connection with the first person who seems to understand you. Of course, even platonic relationships of that sort can be unstable and have problems of their own. You might not be able to fix all your trouble in getting along with people immediately, but you can actually get a lot done -- and avoid trouble -- if you focus on practical work today.","You are overdue for some fun in one of your close relationships, but all sorts of practical things come up that urgently need to be done today. This could send your frustration level sky high. Enlist the other person’s help in clearing the obstacles and see if you can make the tasks more pleasant by working together; you both have a lot of energy to burn off. If nothing else, you will at least be able to celebrate afterward sooner.","You want to be the fun one in your family for a change. You are used to being the heavy one -- the one who tells others they can’t afford some frivolous expense -- but you are suddenly tired of that role. Today, try doing what appeals to you personally and watch how those around you react. They may take this surprisingly hard, if they have been relying on you to set their boundaries, however, the most responsible thing you can do now is hand them their own responsibilities.","You may have to be the serious one today if someone in your home or family is going through an upheaval. If things have gotten confusing, it might fall on you to articulate and communicate the basic facts of the situation. Although you could find yourself taking center stage to an extent greater than you usually do, your basic Aquarius personality traits like seeking what is best for the group and being a little bit emotionally distant will help calm things down.","You may receive a surprising communication from someone you would not expect -- maybe it’s even an anonymous message. With the home and money areas of your life basically stable at the moment, you have some space for some fun, so just let your imagination run wild about this exciting provocation. Whether or not you ever solve the mystery, the fantasy process you go through while thinking about it could lead you to insights that are important for other issues in your life."
2021-04-14,"Our ability to pursue pleasure is reinvigorated as blissful Venus moves into Taurus, one of her favorite signs, at 2:22 pm EDT. The Moon is also in Taurus today, strengthening the mellow vibe. As the Moon makes a square to expansive Jupiter, the pull toward fulfilling our sensual desires may be hard to resist. But the Moon is also making a trine to penetrating Pluto, so we can convince ourselves we are learning something really important while we do what feels good.","The outside world is full of the fast-paced excitement you love, but you do not have a lot to hold on to there. You may not like to admit to being temporal, but material security just makes more sense at times. Now, material security is easier than usual for you to come by, as Venus shines on your financial life. Even if you just add a new item to a collection of yours, physical goods will be more enjoyable than normal for you today.","You get to focus on what makes you look and feel good now that Venus is entering your sign. You may discover, though, that there is a difference between what improves your image in public and what actually makes you feel your best. Today, you have the intellectual power to think through that distinction and plan accordingly. You can succeed at getting the best of both worlds, but you will do a better job of it if you have an idea of what you are doing.","You are becoming more tolerant of quiet than usual, as you find you have sweet dreams when you finally settle down and rest. Though you are known for your quick mind, heavier problems can keep you stuck for a long time because they lack the instant gratification you prefer. You might soon discover that those problems finally resolve when you stop working so hard on them. Allow yourself to space out and enjoy the surprises as things resolve themselves.","Your greater social life feels good today, which can help you get perspective on a closer relationship that feels stuck. You could directly ask an acquaintance for advice, as sometimes a person who isn’t already deeply involved in your situation can see it more clearly. You don’t have to say anything about that topic if you don’t want to, though. Just taking part in a more relaxed way of relating with others will help you get out of your rut.","You start to see results of the day-to-day work you have been putting in as you finally get a boost in your career. You might be tempted to spend a lot of time socializing in a professional context to celebrate your achievement. Yes, chatting at work can cross a line into becoming a distraction, but you could not be where you are now without the attention you have given to building relationships along the way. Enjoy the people who make your job worth doing.","You have a lot to do today, but having things to do is your comfort zone, so you feel personally empowered by being at the center of all the activity. You may also experience a pleasant broadening of your perspective. While sometimes you tend to keep your head down and focus on your duties, now you can look up and see how your attention to detail is contributing to something bigger. When you are proud of your accomplishments, you won't feel the need to defend them.","This could be a good money day for you, though the bonus is more likely to come from some route less conventional than showing up at work and earning a paycheck. It could just involve becoming aware of money that's already hiding in plain sight, because you are well equipped to get to the bottom of things now. If another person is involved, it may be a matter of asking them the right questions; they aren’t trying to hide anything, but they thought you already knew.","Close relationships are satisfying for you today. You can just luxuriate in the nurturing atmosphere if you want to. If you need to have a deep conversation, though, today you can do so in a way where you and the other person both put the best construction on everything. You'll approach the interaction from a foundation of generosity. When you believe that there is enough for everyone involved to have what they need, it often turns out that there is.","Starting today, you'll be getting help with your practical work for the next few weeks, in the form of Venus. Though you often prefer to focus on something more fun or intellectual, Venus just asks you to make your chores beautiful, and you can get behind that. The more sensual pleasure you incorporate, the better. You are definitely allowed to start by making the tastiest food you can think of, as long as you do an extra good job cleaning up the kitchen afterward.","You are drawn to nurture your inner child today. It might be hard to resist spending money to have fun -- after all, you do have the wallet of an adult. While you shouldn't spend beyond your means, a little treat would not hurt. Although this youthful energy within you may feel disruptive in the moment, it can be helpful in the future if you can find a way to incorporate it into the ongoing growth of your personality.","Your home life is comfortable for you today. You might as well enjoy the comfort if it feels good, but if part of you feels like something is off, you might look at whether you have gotten TOO comfortable at home. Has the pursuit of coziness in the moment kept you from embarking on a greater journey of expanding into the person you are meant to be? Try to be aware of the difference between a support system and a sinkhole.","You may be surrounded by enjoyable chatter today, but keep your wits about you. The fun could get so out of hand that you are tempted to spill a secret in the heat of the moment, and doing this would definitely cause drama. If you can stay on track, though, you and your conversation partners might reach a deep insight about the dynamics of your larger social circle. The difference between information and gossip is simply kindness."
2021-04-15,"We are eager to interact with others as the Moon enters chatty Gemini in the wee hours of the morning. A reinforcing sextile between the active Sun and expansive Jupiter at 12:59 pm EDT helps us to also get things done. When the Moon makes a sextile with wounded Chiron tonight, though, we become aware of the complex motivations behind our plans. Taking the time necessary to let whatever comes up unfold can help us plot our course more effectively going forward.","You are focused on yourself today, but you are able to do this in a way that does not attack others. Even if you share about something painful, your goal is more to understand your own experience than to assign blame. The people hearing you should pick up on that, and they will, therefore, generally be on your side. After all, if you are only figuring yourself out rather than battling against someone else, there isn’t really any other side to be on.","Your progress in your career might have been getting you more money lately, yet you may also have realized that money doesn't heal your wounds. Increasing your wealth can hurt in the short term instead of feeling immediately great, as it brings up memories of earlier times in your life when you did not have enough. Sometimes you can’t grieve until you are in a more stable place, and now you are in that more stable place. This is a sign of progress.","You may take social media drama to another level today as you tie larger philosophical or political points to your personal story, articulating your wounds in great detail. Be aware of how you are using emotion in your argument, though. If you feel that drawing others to your cause by any means necessary serves the greater good, you might be very successful at it, but use some of your tremendous emotional intelligence to consider how you would feel if someone else manipulated you like that.","You have powerful backers helping you reach your goals, and it feels great to know that others are on your side. With that strong foundation, you have enough stability now to look inward at the deeper dynamics surrounding your ambitions. If you are pursuing a particular profession or calling to heal a wound of yours -- or to make things better for others who have had experiences similar to your own -- this is a good time to reflect on how much progress you have made toward that end.","Connecting feels good today in relationships of all kinds. You can have fun with others on social media, but watch out for fights about politics and religion. Look out for what is really worth your time in that regard, and focus on the people who agree with you rather than the people who don’t. If you come across someone whose ideology meshes well with yours, that might become the foundation for a fulfilling partnership. Agreement isn't everything, but it can make things a lot easier.","You can get a glimpse of your larger goals today, but you might get distracted ruminating about the traumas that drew you toward those goals in the first place. Spending time reflecting on your motivations may bring up painful memories, but it is a valuable experience. If you want to get back in your groove, though, your day-to-day work still needs doing. You may find the gratification of simple tasks grounding and the appreciation of the people you serve validating now.","You may be looking for a philosophical perspective on a situation where you feel wounded in a relationship. The issue at the moment is not so much whatever happened between you and the other person, but how whatever happened interferes with your larger ability to make sense of the world. Make sure to put yourself in the picture you paint, too. Don’t blame yourself for things that are not your fault, but it might feel empowering to look at your own responsibility.","You are not entirely thrilled about being in a role of service to others today, because you can tell the dynamic is not reciprocal at this point. If you feel like you need to stay in the situation regardless, can you see meaning in it? There is no guarantee that others will ever repay you -- though there is also no guarantee that they won’t. All you can count on is knowing that the people close to you are better off because of you now.","You are looking for balance in a significant relationship, because it is important for you to have your space to be an individual. Realistically, you know it can’t be all about you when you are partnering with someone else, whether personally or professionally, but you don’t want to suppress yourself to the point that you feel resentful either. Fortunately, today you are equipped to talk things out with the other person, and hearing their perspective may give you clarity that you can’t get inside your own head.","You are generally satisfied with the resources you have and proud that you can channel them into improving your home and family life. You may even feel driven to give your children or other younger members of your family the things you didn’t get in your own childhood, in an effort to heal yourself. Now, it might be time for you to look at whether you are meeting the actual needs of these individuals, because they may differ from what you needed.","It is important for you to express yourself today, and you may come on strong, talking about personal wounds. The biggest wound troubling you, however, might not be the specific incident that comes most dramatically to mind, rather, a general sense that your presence as an individual person has not been seen and honored. You could get more validation if you focus on this broader experience of feeling unseen and unheard rather than sinking deep into the details of a particular situation.","You may have a secret benefactor trying to support you, however, accepting their generous gift could be hard for you if you are blocked by family conditioning around money -- like if you feel you do not deserve to receive anything you did not work hard to earn. Yes, work and responsibility are important, but real life is more complex sometimes. Just appreciate the largesse for now, and try to pay it forward to someone else when you are better situated later."
2021-04-16,"The cracks in our lives' structures appear today as the energizing Sun makes a stressful square with transformative Pluto. We start out trying to handle the disruption rationally with the help of the Moon's supportive trine to serious Saturn in the morning. By the end of the day, however, we are emotionally fried, as the Moon squares self-pitying Neptune. We may need to accept what has broken down so that we can rebuild with greater strength going forward.","The outer world seems to be weighing on you today. No matter what you do, you feel like you cannot stay on the good side of the authority figures in your life, and even your allies seem to be aligning with them. While they're all focused on responsibility, though, you have an excellent opportunity to turn your powerful energy toward your inner life. If you can, take some space away from others and focus on self-care. Nurturing your physical body would be an ideal way to avoid trouble.","You are looking for answers in your life, but the authority figures and philosophical systems you are used to asking do not seem to be helpful now, and crowdsourcing through your friends just confuses things even more. Going within to reflect can be intimidating because you tend to like order and might fear finding chaos. Your practical Taurus nature will give you an advantage at thinking things through, though, because you are good at observing which values actually work in the world around you.","You may see yourself as the emotional voice for others today. This seems easier than taking a purely intellectual approach in your communication, but it can get out of hand. You might also be idealizing an authority figure, particularly one who portrays a nurturing image. However good that person or institution actually is, pushing an unrealistic view of them will only lead to disappointment. You have the capacity for sorting things out rationally, so be sure to use it.","Your personal relationships feel heavy today, but the larger world feels lighter. The common denominator in all of this is you. As a Cancer, you get very concerned about your close connections, but in the bigger sphere, you let yourself loosen up a little bit. Try giving the people in your intimate realm a taste of your social self -- the version of you that is not continually fretting about the state of some relationship, but is, instead, looking for pleasurable comfort in life.","Your ability to rally a crowd when you need to might work against you today. The stage is an easier environment for you than a one-on-one confrontation, but if you have a problem in a close relationship, you really need to work it out directly with that person instead of drawing your larger posse into the issue. The right answer here is not strength in numbers but rather strength in argument. You need to be accountable, even when it’s hard.","You may feel like you should merge resources in one of your close relationships, but something is holding you back. It will be hard for you to see the other person as a peer you can negotiate with fairly if you are idealizing them in a parental way. This may be something going on in your own head rather than something they are encouraging, but you need to make sure that whatever merger takes place recognizes both of you as equal adults.","The routine interactions in your daily life feel grinding and overwhelming today. Yes, you are dealing with people, but people are not treating each other like humans; it’s more about the joyless fulfillment of duties. Try to focus on the relationships where you don’t feel taken for granted. If you can, bring that type of energy into the situations that have gotten off track. Calling it out openly may backfire, but an unspoken reminder could inspire people to change their attitude.","You want to get stuff done today, but your tasks may get held up by unclear instructions. The Scorpio mind gets accused of being paranoid, but you really do need to look at who benefits from the lack of clarity in this situation. Under the cover of vagueness, the rules that get enforced could turn out to be one thing for some and another thing for others. Do your best to demand that the boundaries be articulated openly.","You are like magma bubbling under Earth’s surface, and, today, one of your close relationships is the volcano that the magma flows out of as it becomes lava. Of course, the volcano is the one that gets blamed in the news reports about the destructive eruption, but is it really that simple? You have a lot of heavy stuff going on. If you can’t deal with it honestly, you might continually see it in the people around you. It's time to face some personal truths.","There is intensity in your internal world as you are reflecting on how your identity has been shaped by your past. Complicating this, you may realize that the communication you received growing up was more vague than explicit, so people believed what they wanted rather than comparing notes and having discussions. You need to find more clarity in your value system at this point, though. You might still wind up believing what you want, but at least you will have a clearer idea of why you believe it.","It is hard for you to talk about what is really bothering you right now -- you might even have trouble articulating your vague sense of unease to yourself. It is easier to focus on how your life would be better if, for example, you had more money, because you can imagine some specifics there. This sort of fantasy may be a pleasant and mostly harmless diversion, but don’t let your desire to get rich quickly lure you into taking risks you cannot afford.","The opinions of the collective seem to overpower your own values now. Therefore, you may feel lonely even when you are with people, because you know that they don’t know the real you. If you are going to be alone regardless, you might as well enjoy some peace and quiet at home. Your views probably need clarification before you are ready to share them, anyway. When you feel safe from judgment, you can burrow within and get to know yourself."
2021-04-17,"Our words and our actions are in harmony today as communicative Mercury makes a sextile with assertive Mars at 3:09 pm EDT. Big-dreaming Jupiter also connects positively with Mercury and Mars, so even the most routine things that we work on seem like they are part of something substantial. Meanwhile, the sensitive Moon collaborates with the whole trio of Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter. Our emotions are in tune with what we are doing, though we may find all the action a little overwhelming.","You can do a great job promoting yourself today, as you are very articulate about who you are. You are in the mood to assertively pursue connection, and your efforts will be received well by the outside world. If you have things like social media profiles and business cards, check whether they reflect your current identity and update them as needed. If you have been meaning to set up something of that sort for a while, go for it now.","Money and ambition can work together on your behalf today. While sometimes you feel like you need to sacrifice one for the other, at this point, your drive to make more money will increase your status, and vice versa. You cannot lose. You may have to think quickly about a new opportunity, but do not make an impulsive decision. Keep your thinking cap on tight and stay in the background, carefully reviewing the details of whatever is being proposed to you.","You can make a compelling argument in the public sphere today for views that are important to you. You are articulate and able to follow a quickly moving discussion, but beware of becoming a bully. You can come on strong now, especially if you feel like you need to defend yourself against a personal attack. The problem is, you may be perceiving personal attacks where none were intended. Try to get as good at listening as you are at talking.","You might be moody and irritable today, and the reason could be hard to pin down. It could have to do with an issue related to your ambitions that has been weighing on you. You might feel like you need to work this out by yourself, but you would be better off seeking outside support. Whatever you are struggling with is fixable with help, and others feel invested enough in your success that they are willing to share their resources with you.","If your social life needs revitalization, bringing your intellectual life into it should give it the boost you crave. You are able to communicate what you have been reading and learning in a way that others can understand, but it won’t just be a one-way exchange -- they will find, as you do, that what you have been thinking about serves as a launching point for deeper conversations. What you share with others can strengthen your relationships now, and even help acquaintances grow into close friends.","An authority figure in your life may seem volatile today, and it is probably in your best interest to try to help them calm down. You have a gift for solving mysteries now, and you might have to use it to get to the bottom of their problem. Most of the evidence, however, will be handed to you if you just hear the person out -- it’s not really a mystery that everyone needs to be heard out sometimes, no matter who they are.","You are looking for both fun and intellectual stimulation today, and you don’t want to do it alone. Learning something new together could be just the thing to refresh an established friendship or romantic relationship that has gotten tired. If you are feeling lonely, though, try a group class online where you have the opportunity to meet people. Conversation will flow easily, so you can find out who you want to talk to more. A connection developed under today’s influences could become significant over time.","You have emotional power over others today and you can be successful at getting what you want. Be careful to use this power for good, though, and keep a sense of perspective about what you are using it for, lest you appear as a petty tyrant. If you can convince the people you share space with, at home or anywhere else, that they will benefit directly from the tasks at hand, then you can get a lot done together.","You might feel restless in a relationship, if not in your life in general. You don’t have to go far to change up the pace, though. If you find yourself bickering with a friend or loved one -- especially if you have been spending a lot of time at home with them -- try exploring in or around your town together. Just getting out of the house will refresh your perspective and give you something new to talk about, and you will find more than you expect hiding in plain sight.","You want to get a lot done, and you can today, but don't get so pushy about cracking down on your to-do list that you alienate other people. You have to remember that they are humans and not just means to the end of your goals. Your home could be a hotbed of communication, though, and hearing from those close to you will help you maintain perspective and remind you how fortunate you are to have them around.","It does not take much to entertain you today as your spirit is light and you find random things hilarious. Because laughter is contagious, you even get credit for being funny. Simple things are bringing you joy now, and you have the ability to share that joy with others through witty observations and conversations. You might enjoy being the center of attention, but the greater pleasure will be knowing that you have brought cheer to the people around you.","You have been sitting on a big dream in private lately, and while it’s not quite time to act on it, you can start thinking about some of the details today. For instance, if the plan is for your dream to ultimately make you money, you may have to figure out how to financially support the beginning of it. If you're considering changes that would affect your family, you'll need to think about how to get them on board. The more planning you do now, the happier you'll be later."
2021-04-18,"A flurry of fast-paced developments comes today as we lead up to the active Sun's conjunction with communicative Mercury at 9:50 pm EDT. We are pushed to respond quickly to provocations that seem to pop up out of nowhere, but this does not feel comfortable for us emotionally, as the sensitive Moon is challenged by a square with wounded Chiron. The Moon also makes a gentler connection with surprising Uranus, however, so our problems could be solved in unexpected ways.","The big things in your domestic life are running smoothly as financial gaps seem to be filling in surprising ways. With that basic level of security in place, you have room to wonder where you fit into all of this. Your personality is bigger than a “Home Sweet Home” sign is equipped to encompass. Safe and secure does not have to be subdued, so try to make room for your whole, passionate self in your sanctuary.","You may be easily offended in conversation today, and you need to look within and think through what is bothering you rather than striking back immediately. Others who step on your toes may not mean to cause trouble. You have been changing a lot lately, and the news may not have made its way to your full circle yet. You don’t have to share more than you feel comfortable with, but keep in mind that people only know as much as you tell them.","You are in the mood to interact today, but it will feel unfulfilling if you compromise your deeper values for a shallow connection in the moment. You may tend to hide who you really are around others right now because you fear sharing something potentially controversial would threaten your ability to start and maintain a conversation. However, giving people something that's interesting enough to remember will help you build a lasting relationship with them, so don't hold back everything.","You can be overwhelmed by the demands of authority figures today -- you feel that they are pushing you in a direction that is out of sync with the sensitivity you think a situation deserves. In the end, you have to be able to live with yourself, so do what you need to do to transform the situation. Even if you get accused of being overly emotional, there are probably others who agree with you but are afraid to speak up, and they will be relieved that you took action.","You are inclined to bring some previously hidden parts of yourself out into your professional identity today. However, you may also remember why you held off from doing this before, as you could get pushback from people who represent the ideology that's dominant in your work setting. Defending your views can be exhausting and can interfere with getting actual work done, so pick your battles thoughtfully. Look for a quick win if you can find one.","Serious wounds could come up in a discussion with your friends or another group you're involved in. You might hurt others, or they might hurt you. Either way, you can show leadership in finding a new way of thinking about whatever the issue is. Articulating a fresh path forward will ultimately help everyone involved, as difficult topics that go undiscussed have a tendency to accumulate deep ruts that nothing good ever comes out of. Share your idea with everyone, no matter how strange it may seem.","Your close relationships feel overwhelming today, and it’s not just because there is more conversation and activity than usual. Others may be acting in ways that remind you of a parental relationship you experienced that was critical or demanding. You have an opportunity right now, however, to break out of old ruts in how you unite with people. Focus on building intimacy with people as individual humans rather than trying to fit them into particular roles in your life. Getting this recognition from you should shift their attitude.","It may be hard for you to find meaning today in an unending flow of duties and burdens that feels overwhelming. The hard part is not so much the specific contents of your to-do list, but that you want a greater sense of purpose and direction in your life. You'd be wise to ask others for help to get things done faster. This could also transform some of your relationships, and you may find new meaning in those connections.","The conflict between expressing your individuality and pursuing union with others weighs heavily on you today. You are emotionally drawn toward relationships, but you have a fear of losing yourself in them, and you may wonder if you are too flawed to deserve this sort of connection anyway. You can reach more balance and stability now by changing your focus and embracing your responsibilities. Though practical work may be a necessity, you can still find freedom in it by adding your own personal flair.","Your home and family life is full of activity, but the demands on you might be so great right now that a close relationship gets neglected. Some one-on-one time together would be restorative for both of you. Though the other person might wonder out loud where you have been, you wonder where you have been, too. Your family needs you, but you can fulfill your responsibilities to them less resentfully when you are grounded in a sense of yourself as an individual.","You might need to have a big conversation today, one that you are not looking forward to. It is tempting to burrow into your to-do list and tell others you can’t talk to them because you have too much on your plate, however, your to-do list will be able to wait a day, and you know it. It will be harder to catch the person you need to talk to in the right space later on, though, so take advantage of the opportunity now.","Jealousy about money might be triggered in you today, even if you have enough to meet your basic needs. Someone else could be boastful about having more, tempting you to try to catch up by impractical means like gambling. Before you do anything regrettable, go on a walk around your neighborhood to clear your mind and get perspective on the situation. So many different things are going on with people that you cannot possibly compete with everyone, so just compete to be the best version of yourself."
2021-04-19,"Our pace of life slows down and becomes more relaxed once the Sun enters sensual Taurus at 4:33 pm EDT. Intellectual Mercury also enters Taurus today, making our thoughts slow and steady. Still, we will have plenty to think about as the sensitive Moon in Cancer makes a stressful opposition to manipulative Pluto in the evening, bringing up issues of power and control. Taurus' energy is grounded in the physical world, and that may be just the thing to turn down the emotional temperature.","You may be dealing with a conflict between personal ambition and nurturing others now. It probably goes beyond the particular work and family matters setting it off today -- back to the patterns you learned in your upbringing. Your finances, meanwhile, are coming into focus for you, and that may show you a way out of this seemingly unsolvable dilemma. Evaluate how you can use the resources you have to support both pursuing your professional goals and taking care of the people who matter to you.","Emotional manipulation or bullying are likely to come up in your communications today. You are more visible than usual, so that could make you an easy target for others. You also feel more forceful than usual, so it’s possible that you are the one perpetrating this behavior. You might be able to get what you want, whether or not you should, so consider if cultivating an atmosphere of resentment is a worthy price for achieving your goal.","You might be involved in a money drama with others today, though it all has to be kept hush-hush. Being aware of the difference between privacy and secrecy will help you engage in a constructive way. Privacy helps you work out an issue without giving the whole world the opportunity to weigh in and make it more complicated. Secrecy adds titillation and makes the issue seem like a bigger deal than it is. Your situation needs privacy, but the secrecy should be dialed down.","It's easier for you to spot control issues within one of your close relationships today. This dynamic has been going on for a while, but it is normally harder to pin down, so being able to articulate it finally is actually a relief. Figuring out what to do about it is another challenge though. Interacting with a larger group online or through social media may give you some ideas; just experiencing different types of relationships can help you get out of your rut.","Professional advancement is coming into view for you. You would love a shiny new title, but you'll need to get your ego out of the way long enough to look at the details of any new position that you are considering. Make sure you thoroughly review a copy of the job description before you agree to anything, because there may be a lack of clarity about what you are really responsible for, and this ambiguity will not be handled in your favor.","Your intellectual pursuits get a boost from the Sun and Mercury starting today. With your ability to carefully think things through, you may be able to unsnarl drama that arises within a group or community you are part of. If the group’s purpose has been forgotten or was unclear to begin with, that may be part of the problem. Try to negotiate a balance between meeting the human needs of the individual people involved and staying focused on your collective goals.","You feel like you cannot please everyone in a conflict between work and family today. You are trying to move forward with your ambitions, but someone needs you at home. You need to clarify your actual shared responsibilities, because at least one person involved in the situation has expectations that are not in line with reality. Whether the error in perception is on your end or the other person’s, the truth will set you free, so insist on digging it up.","You want to explore and broaden your perspective, but your early conditioning may be holding you back. You are known for your loyalty, and you might feel like straying from your roots would betray them somehow. However, feelings of renewal can come from your close relationships now. Giving one of them the credit for a change you need to make anyway could help you rationalize the change to yourself, because you would still be able to see yourself as loyal to those you love.","People may see you as manipulative with money. Maybe you have been using manipulation to avoid some task you should be doing, then the exaggerated perceptions that others developed fed on themselves. You now have the ability to focus productively on your responsibilities, though, so tackle whatever is truly your end of the bargain. Those involved in your situation will take note of this, and it should inspire them to see you in a different light and engage more collaboratively with you.","A close relationship could feel clingy and demanding today. The other person’s emotional needs may seem intimidating to you, and your own fear of your inability to meet their needs only makes the situation worse. Your idea of what they require from you may be exaggerated, though, if you are holding yourself responsible for solving all their problems. They might just want you to be present with them. If they feel up to it, doing something fun together could lift the heavy vibe.","Your home and family life is getting a boost from the Sun and Mercury starting today, making the whole next month a great time to dig into domestic improvements. In the short term, though, disputes over chores and other routine responsibilities could get surprisingly out of hand when hidden resentment gets triggered in you. If everything is on you, you may need to open a discussion of how every member of your household can pull their weight in a way that's appropriate to their abilities.","You are inundated with communication today. Social media might be particularly overwhelming if people are discussing heavy issues. The actual facts of your own experience may not fit with a narrative that someone else is pushing with great emotional force. You cannot win with people like that right now, especially in a group setting, so just get out of there. If you are able to have a one-on-one conversation in person, you would at least be more likely to reach understanding."
2021-04-20,"Today could be dramatic, as the Moon in passionate Leo squares the Sun in sensual Taurus at 2:59 am EDT, and then similarly challenges Mercury, Venus, and Uranus -- also in Taurus -- throughout the day. Taurus is known for a focus on physical security and placid peace, but the Moon coming into conflict with this will insist that calm cannot come at the expense of the individual needs of anyone involved. If everyone is respected, a good time can be had by all.","Money is burning a hole in your pocket now. You are definitely drawn toward entertaining yourself as well, so you could be tempted to spend on an exciting impulse purchase or even gamble. Your motivation is not feelings of lack, which is potentially a more dangerous scenario. Instead, you basically feel good, and you want to keep the fun going. You still need to use common sense, but today’s opportunity actually could work out better than it normally would.","You want to go in a new direction in your life, but members of your family may be reacting with big emotional displays. It seems they liked the old you better, but they haven’t even given the new you a chance. It can be hard to assess whether there are grains of truth in their complaints, but, as long as you are meeting your legitimate responsibilities toward your family, you should not have anything to worry about. You may just have to wait out the storm.","You are just barely holding on to an exciting secret that you may really be tempted to tell people. Before you spill the tea, though, think about whether doing so would have any benefit beyond getting you a bit of attention in the moment. What you say could spread like wildfire today, so be especially careful about broadcasting news that belongs to others. If you want to start a rumor about yourself, feel free to say whatever you can live with.","Today you might have to put your money where your mouth is, especially if you are used to talking a big game about some ideal of yours. When it actually costs you to live out your convictions, financially or otherwise, how you react in that moment can come as a surprise even to you. You may be proud to step up to the opportunity, or you may realize reality is different from what you thought. Either way, you will have learned something.","You have been shaping your public image lately, but today, any gaps between that version of you and who you really are will become apparent. There are always some differences between public and personal life, but what you want to avoid is narcissism, where you try to project an image of perfection that becomes increasingly detached from reality. Being comfortable in your human self will ultimately further your ambitions by helping you make genuine connections with others -- and it will feel better, too.","You may become aware today that the philosophy you advocate in public has some discrepancies with your actual, private experiences. You don’t have to blurt this out immediately, and you may not want to do so if you are afraid of losing social ties. There is not necessarily one right answer to balancing the competing demands of community expectations and personal honesty. You need at least one person in your life you can tell your whole truth to, though, even if you can’t tell everyone.","It is hard for you to keep things casual in your casual friendships today, because your mind is on more intense things. There certainly are risks to bringing up heavy topics in a context not accustomed to them, and you have to be careful about the possibility of provoking drama. A potential reward, however, is that you could discover that you have more in common with an acquaintance than you thought. Developing a deeper relationship in this way would definitely be fulfilling.","You really enjoy the company of your close relationships today, but if you are used to a particular connection being just between the two of you -- and not necessarily even known to others -- that may get shaken up. Your partnerships are more visible to the rest of the world than usual, and this can be intimidating for you because you like your privacy. If you don’t have anything serious to hide, though, you should survive the discomfort of the moment.","You are making a lot of progress toward taking care of your responsibilities, but your heart is calling out for more excitement in your life. You may not be able to experience all the adventure you want right now, but working some variety into the things you do closer to home could be more fulfilling than you think. For example, you need to eat anyway, so you might try cooking an edgy new recipe you have been curious about. Expansion comes in many forms.","You might think you are having the ultimate lighthearted, fun day, but then somehow it takes a dramatic turn. If emotions that you were not expecting come up in you, let them flow and don’t feel guilty about it. Sometimes you can’t become aware of your feelings until you relax, so getting surprisingly emotional is actually a good sign that you are becoming more relaxed. If you can allow a release of this sort to happen, you will feel truly lighter afterward.","You are deeply engaged in your home and family life today, and the buzzing activity generally feels good. One of your close relationships, however, may feel left out and create drama if you do not acknowledge them. You may not be able to give everyone everything they want on the same day, but you could give your family a taste of the more open version of yourself that you display in your one-on-one relationships. This would revitalize your home life even further.","If you have not started your spring cleaning yet, this would be an excellent day to do so. The hard part of cleaning is not so much the physical tasks as it is the mental process of deciding what to keep and how to organize what you keep. You have energy for both the physical and mental sides now, but you especially have the inspiration to create new organizational systems that will be sustainable going forward. Your future self will thank you for the effort you put in today."
2021-04-21,"Our individual desires feel restrained by the needs or expectations of others, as the temperamental Moon hits a frustrating opposition to taskmaster Saturn at 1:56 am EDT. The Moon also connects awkwardly with Neptune in the evening, adding a layer of emotional manipulation onto this atmosphere of obligation. We will need to balance what we ideally think we should be doing with what we are honestly capable of doing, even if the truth is not all we want it to be.","Your social life may feel burdensome today on account of the tedious administrative work required to bring people together, even for an online gathering. A favorite hobby could lose its luster if you have come to associate it with a group that needs regular meetings planned, scheduled, and attended. You might want to skip the Zoom and try to reconnect independently with the passion that led you there in the first place. You need a bigger reason than just habit to stay involved.","The actual needs of your family may come into conflict with your expectations of what a family should look like. This push for duty and structure is compounded by a nebulous sense of obligation that seems to be coming from your larger community. You feel judged by others. Whether or not these people are as focused on you as you think, though, they won’t have to live with the outcome of an unkind decision you make in your household, but you will. Know your intentions and consider your consequences.","You are careful and precise in your communications today. Overall, this is a good thing, as clear communication and clear thinking tend to reinforce each other. You can see the whole picture, not just the details. A professional situation, however, may need a touch of vagueness. The issue is that some of the relevant information may not be known yet, so if you are too precise at this point, you might lock yourself into something that later turns out to not be possible. Be open to keeping some things open.","You can get clarity on your finances today and figure out what is actually going on in a situation where you share resources with another person. Your view of this circumstance may be blocked by what you think you should be going on, according to the words of your favorite personal finance guru. Any guru worth following, however, would say you have to know the facts, whether you like them or not, of what you are really doing before you can make any changes. Get real about the facts of your unique situation.","You may feel held back by a significant relationship today, but not be for the reasons you think. Maybe the issue is not so much however this person is irritating you in the moment as it is a larger lack of clarity about resources you share with them. If you don’t know how to address a big issue like that, then you can feel controlled by not having the information you need, causing you to lash out over petty things. Pull back and consider the real root of your feelings.","You could feel martyred by what you see as your responsibilities to another person today. You may be doing all kinds of stuff to impress them or make them feel obligated to you, yet they don’t give you the appreciation or recognition you feel you deserve, which drives you crazy. Try actually talking to the other person before you explode with frustration, though, because an inaccurate view of your relationship could be pushing you toward sacrifices that no one asked you to make.","You may be getting attention on social media today, but it feels a little hollow because you know you are getting it for portraying a particular image that people have come to expect. It is easier to show that image than to articulate your true identity at this point, because factors you have relied on to define your identity in the past have been quietly shifting over time. For now, work on defining an internal sense of self in private where you're free from expectation and assumption.","Your home life may feel burdensome, to the point that you are tempted to vent about it in a professional context today. You never wanted to be that person who goes off about their family drama at work, but you feel like you get more understanding there than you do at home. When you are confused about where YOU fit into a challenging domestic situation, it can be hard to keep usual boundaries. You do need someone to talk to, just be careful about who you choose and the atmosphere you create.","You want to be recognized for your intellectual achievements, but you may be afraid of alienating family members or others in your life whose view of you is several years behind. You are not a little kid anymore, you are an adult with opinions of your own, and not all of them will be universally shared by your loved ones. For now, you may find that you are more accepted and connect better with people who live far away from you or have a background very different from your own.","You may find it difficult to communicate with others today about resources you share with them, because emotions seem to cloud the issue. Even if you are in the power position based on numbers alone, that isn’t the only thing that matters in the real world. You might wonder if you are obligated to give in just because another person seems more upset. It may not be your official duty, but sometimes the cheapest way to solve a problem is with money.","You feel like you need to be the serious and stable one in a close relationship today, because the other person seems more emotional. Even an overall good partnership -- either business or personal -- can go through patches when effort is not shared equally, so this is not necessarily a problem, in moderation. Do not let the tempest of the moment push you into making an unwise financial decision, though. Some flexibility in your approach to money may be necessary in the short term, but avoid making lasting changes now.","Your true identity is not easy for others to see. You are known for what you do, but you think there is more to you than that, so you may feel a little resentful. At the same time, you, yourself, can’t quite pin down what people are missing. Your perceptions are vague right now and you may be struggling to see where you stand or articulate who you really are. Clarity will return to both you and others, so for now, try to embrace a more nebulous state of being."
2021-04-22,"We find life is full of surprises leading up to sensuous Venus' conjunction with electric Uranus at 9:01 pm EDT. Venus is associated with money and pleasure, so those matters especially may get a welcome boost. Fortifying the good vibes further, over the course of the day the Moon moves from Leo, where it pushes grandiose Jupiter to even wilder heights, into Virgo, where it makes a peaceful trine with the Sun. We receive inspiration, and realize we have the practical skills to act on it.","Your reliable work toward your financial goals can get some surprise support today. It is not necessary for you to take any unusual risks, as opportunity is more likely to come gently. Your larger social network has been observing your determined approach toward your responsibilities, and someone there might want to be part of your success. Accept their offer if it feels right, but continuing your regular duties at a steady pace will be exceptionally rewarding for you either way.","A new self-care technique for your body could feel especially great today. You have a strong sense for these things to begin with, so you will be able to find the practice that is right for you. If you get a sudden inspiration to pursue a new look while you are tuning yourself up, go for it. Don’t worry about how it will be received at work, because you can have a little fun now and still be respected.","You can be chatty today, but not in a superficial way. Even if you cannot articulate all the details, you are in tune with something bigger than yourself that is providing you with a fresh source of inspiration. Those you converse with will pick up on your enthusiasm and will generally respond with open minds to your take on important topics -- even if those topics are controversial -- because you present them in a generous way. Your approach makes all the difference.","A surprising opportunity may come to you through your larger circle of friends and acquaintances. Even if it sounds unusual, it could wind up being very rewarding for you financially. You might benefit more than the other person, but in a way where they still feel good about their ability to be generous, rather than resentful. For you, the hardest thing about this situation may be accepting that you can get a lucky break without working to earn it.","An unexpected development could result in increased visibility for you at work. You will not inhabit center stage alone, though, as the foundation of your achievement is the relationships you have built over time. This time, one of your close connections is especially generous toward you, and all you need to do, for now, is just appreciate this. You have enough of a sense of give-and-take that you will recognize when it is time for you to return the favor.","Your understanding of the world is shifting in a way that feels freer. A benefit you get from this today is that how you see yourself is, for once, in harmony with your ideals. You are an expert at many forms of self-improvement when you need to be, but sometimes what needs to change is the rigid standards you hold yourself to. When you accept yourself instead of getting mired in doubt or shame, you have more energy to share your gifts with the world.","Financial opportunities may emerge for you today, but conventional work for pay is the last place to look for them. Instead of taking the secure and predictable path, walk on the wild side. A new risky or speculative investment could go in your favor. Alternately, an investment or business deal you made long ago could suddenly pay off. As always, only gamble with money you can afford to lose, but you might rack up at least a modest win now.","Someone you are close with may want more space or freedom today than they usually do, and you are secure enough in your own foundation that you are able to roll with their mood. You will probably have to let them take the lead, but if you can give up your need to control things and just follow them with a sense of openness to whatever happens, they will appreciate your support and share their excitement with you.","Starting an invigorating new routine can help you get out of a rut and feeling good. You might especially look at your habits around communications, like when and how often you check your phone or social media accounts. Learning from the experiences of others by reading up on blogs and life hacks can guide your search, but ultimately, the best way to find a healthy system that will work for you personally is to try things out on a small scale.","You may feel good about your finances today, though others who get wind of that might want some of what you have. You certainly can share with others if that feels right to you. Fun is sometimes more rewarding when more people join in, and offering to treat is an easy way to get them on board. Your pleasure matters too, though, so make sure you give only as much as you can give without feeling resentful.","Developments in your domestic sphere may inspire you to expand your definition of home and family. You might not have thought about this too much before, but when events push you to clarify your views, you realize there is enough love to include more people. You like being seen as generous toward others, but you also genuinely feel generous toward others. Even if people cannot reciprocate what you are giving them right now, they appreciate you more than you know.","You could receive an uplifting message today. However it comes to you, the point is that someone you were not expecting -- maybe someone you were not even aware of -- is looking out for you. You may have the ability to grow into a deeper relationship with this person. Even if you don’t pursue the connection further, learning that you have more support than you thought you did can change how you routinely think about your life."
2021-04-23,"Our emotions pack a punch when aggressive Mars enters sensitive Cancer at 7:49 am EDT. We can find ourselves easily offended and ready to react to any provocation, real or imagined. The Moon’s opposition to unrealistic Neptune tonight may supply plenty of imagined provocations, as we have trouble sorting out the truth from our perceptions. However, the Moon also makes a harmonious connection to sensuous Venus, so connecting with the physical world may help us stay grounded in reality.","You'll find more fulfillment in your routine work today because you can see how it serves a larger, even spiritual purpose. Spiritual does not have to mean penniless, however, as you may also be financially rewarded for your labor. This is not a reflection of whether you are objectively better or worse than anyone else, so you don’t need to feel guilty about receiving it. You may choose to use your increased resources to support sacred ends further, perhaps through giving to charity.","You look and feel good today, and your social media self might look even better. Projecting an idealized version of yourself online is generally harmless, as long as you know what you are doing and keep it in perspective. If someone pushes back on you there, however, don’t get aggressive in response. You are better off without the turmoil of a real fight over something you know is a little bit fake. Withdraw from the conflict as peacefully as you can.","You might be tempted to idealize an authority figure today. It is fine to appreciate the good they have done, but try to focus on the facts of their life instead of mixing your admiration for them with your own personal desire to be taken care of and led. Putting someone on an unrealistic pedestal will only lead to disappointment later. The best way to honor your hero is to take action in support of your values yourself.","You are able to stand up for yourself more than usual, but you might find communicating clearly to be a challenge. Maybe it’s okay to be a little vague, though. Think of all the viral memes that spread online because they achieve emotional resonance with what a lot of people are feeling, even if they are light on facts. Today, your strength is grasping the spirit of the moment in this way -- you can work out the details later.","You may feel overwhelmed today by a situation that has become confusing regarding some shared resources. You could be tempted to take action on your own behind the back of the other person involved, but you would be better off directly asking them to agree to consult an outside authority figure together. The two of you may have been trying to work this out amongst yourselves out of embarrassment or fear of punishment, but another perspective will clarify things quickly and more kindly than you expect.","You may have an idealized view of another person in your life who seems intellectual or cultured. Even if this is an accurate assessment of them, you might want to be like who you imagine they are more than you want to actually get to know them as a human. While your connection with them can help you develop your own capacity for the qualities you envy, the relationship will last longer if you can separate your fantasies about them from who they really are.","An absence of boundaries in your work may leave you exhausted and in need of rest. Meanwhile, as you struggle to keep up with your day-to-day responsibilities, you have lost track of your actual professional goals. This lack of direction could be a huge component of your fatigue, if you don’t see purpose in what you do. A mentor figure or benefactor may be able to help you articulate and achieve your big picture. If you know where you are going, you have a better chance of getting there.","You are driven to find answers to life’s big questions as Mars provides energy to your philosophical pursuits over the next six weeks. If you join a new community during this time, you might find yourself overthrowing your identity to match theirs, because your sense of self is weakened now. It is hard to find the line between your capacity for transformation and becoming a chameleon, but someone who genuinely cares for you can help you maintain a sense of perspective.","Life at home is feeling relentless. If you are not able to handle your family's demands within the confines of your usual routine today, you might at least find your work lenient in giving you time off to deal with your problems at home. Staying at work, however, could calm you down, as being around others who are unaffected by your family’s drama would provide a sense of perspective. Whatever you choose, the ability to decide is empowering.","You feel challenged within a close relationship today, like the other person is goading and provoking you. Unclear communication might be making the issue worse, as one of you could be reacting to perceived threats that were not intended. You might be better off stepping away from serious issues for now and trying to do something fun together instead. Engaging in a competitive game or physical activity with one another could help discharge some of the tense energy.","You might be interested in updating and beautifying your home or another shared space and, today, you are able to communicate your vision to others involved. You have an inspired, aesthetic sense for picking colors and other visual components, yet you might not be able to pin down all the financial details of a proposed improvement right now. Over the next six weeks, Mars will be giving you extra energy for physical work, so you can incorporate sweat equity into the budget for your project.","A close relationship may be frustrating today because the other person seems overly emotional. However, getting defensive with them will only make things worse. You might need to take an honest look at whether you are unintentionally contributing to the problem by being inconsistent or leading them to expect things you can’t deliver. If you can listen to the other person with an open mind and be accountable for your own actions, talking things out will help resolve the conflict."
2021-04-24,"We receive surprising news today as communicative Mercury meets spontaneous Uranus at 2:42 am EDT. The insights unleashed can be deep, due to the sensitive Moon's harmonious trine with profound Pluto. As the day goes on, however, the Moon moves on to challenge touchy Mars, triggering petty conflict that gets more heated than it warrants. We find that even necessary change can be difficult in the moment, as the existing equilibrium is disrupted before a better one can emerge to replace it.","You might get some surprising news about a financial bonus today. The hard part will be figuring out who has the right to tell you what to do with your newfound gain. Your family might have one idea, while someone you are in another close relationship with has a different idea. You may not be able to please everyone. You do not have to make your decision today either, so feel free to wait until people calm down and things become clearer.","You are a hub of communications today with the energy to spread a message widely, and you may even have big news of your own to share. You are definitely better at talking than listening now, though. Make an effort to be aware of how your audience is receiving you, as you may step on toes if you push forward too obliviously. Technical difficulties could also challenge you, so allow space for that as you make the best of your day in the spotlight.","You feel inspired today, perhaps from an unexpected source or even a dream, and may start thinking about how to use your resources to support this idea. Try to keep your planning grounded in the larger perspective of your life, though. Striking out impulsively and taking a financial risk could backfire on you, especially if you do this as a reaction against feeling held back by others in the moment. However you fund your scheme needs to be sustainable long term.","A story you hear on social media or in the news could really rattle you. Even if you don’t personally know anyone involved in the event, it might be similar enough to something you have experienced that you want to speak up. Sharing your perspective could provoke tension with your family because, no matter how gently you say it, you are dissenting from the group’s narrative. You have to decide what you can live with, but use discretion when you pick your audience.","An authority figure in your life could surprise you today, showing you that they are not who you thought they were. You may find the change inspiring, but your reaction could also be more complex. Sensations in your body can be subtle signals of information you are picking up, so tune in to these. Also, keep an eye out for passive-aggressive communication, whether you are dishing it out yourself or receiving it from others. Try to get to the root of what is provoking the anger.","Big ideas come together in a surprising way for you today, as you might read or watch an insightful work that suddenly brings clarity to your view of the world. Going through an intellectual growth spurt may feel very awkward, though, at least at first. You can get too aggressive on social media defending values you are passionate about right now, so you might be better off letting your new insights develop further in private before you share them with your larger circle.","Just when you are starting to be more ambitious professionally, you feel moody on a personal level. A discovery about a taboo matter, perhaps a family secret, seems to be upsetting to you. Your distress may not only be about the revelation itself, but also about a greater concern that you will have trouble moving toward your goals when there always seems to be something going on with your family. They may be acting out because they sense your shift, but you will all get through this.","Close relationships could be full of high energy and surprises today. This may be unsettling for you, if someone reminds you of a secret side of yourself that is not in harmony with a philosophy you publicly advocate. The bigger the gap between your ideals and your reality, the more you might be tempted to loudly overcompensate in favor of the ideals. You would be better off avoiding this sort of conflict with others. Instead, try sitting with your paradox in private.","You are drawn to taboo things today, but there is a limit to what you can say about them on social media without causing drama. Stick to sharing funny pictures and information instead. You have a gift now for finding content that illuminates a really strange side of the basic things we take for granted. Others will be grateful to you for providing them with a lighthearted diversion, and you might also come out of it with a new interest or perspective.","Be careful with conflict in your close relationships today, as it is more likely than usual to wind up in the public eye somehow. If you can, try to spend the day focusing on your own interests instead of engaging closely with others. You cannot control what the significant people in your life do. You can, however, do something about your own growing need to pursue your individuality before you blame someone else for your feeling of being suppressed.","You have the energy to make a lot of progress on your to-do list today. If you feel irritable, though, your heart might be calling you to focus on something else, and you should listen. Someone in your home or family may need you to hear them out on an important issue, and it is worth stopping your routine tasks for that. Depending on how the conversation goes, you might also get a chance to flex your philosophical muscles by giving advice.","Intimacy might intimidate you today, as you feel that it threatens your ability to assert your individuality. You have a reputation for being able to lose yourself easily, so you might have to push back harder than others in order to hold your own. If you are able to talk to the person you have an issue with, however, you may be able to reach a breakthrough with them. The insights you discover in conversation could affect your life even beyond this situation."
2021-04-25,"We have reasons to be optimistic today, and then challenges seem to pop up out of nowhere. Intellectual Mercury and social Venus meet at 6:19 pm EDT, but both make a stressful square to Saturn, so our best efforts to communicate and relate may get misconstrued or frustrated. Meanwhile, the sensitive Moon challenges wounded Chiron, so we may take personal offense, even if things were not meant that way. As a result of all this, we will at least become aware of many problems in our lives that need solving.","Your social life is stressful today, as you may feel like you are not loved for who you are. It seems like you have to either change your values to be accepted or accept being rejected, and the unkindness of others’ approach just makes you defensive. Try to reflect on what led up to this. Even if it turns out that you did something wrong, this shows you the importance of handling such situations with compassion when you are on the other side of them.","You might feel sensitive about your body or appearance today. Even if something physically hurts, the pain is not so much the reality of what your body is experiencing in the moment as it is the gap between reality and your expectations of what your experience should be. Judgment, from yourself or others, will only make whatever you are dealing with worse. You may need to find a kind way to bring your expectations of your body into harmony with reality.","You may experience tension today between your private experiences and a worldview that you share with a group or community you are a part of. You are afraid of getting found out because it seems like you cannot tell your whole truth and still be loved by your community. Whether or not that is as true as you think, you may at least be able to enjoy your personal experiences if you keep them to yourself for now and let go of your expectation of validation from others.","You might be tempted to connect with friends as a distraction from deeper issues that are weighing on you, such as family problems. Don’t get too invested in the idea of an easy chat, because whatever is troubling you will eventually come out. Your friends may be able to help you, though, as long as you and they are all clear about the boundaries of what they are and are not capable of accomplishing for you. Just being heard out will lighten your load.","You have been making advances in your career lately, and someone close to you might be jealous of your good fortune. They could make a cutting remark today that feels really hurtful to you. The issue for you is not only what was said, but more broadly, the injustice that someone could say that -- it’s not in line with your expectations of how people should talk to each other. You still have your professional progress, though, and the other person can’t take that away.","You are drawn to expand your perspective today, but feel held back by your responsibilities. You may be exaggerating those responsibilities, however, due to issues of self-worth. You might feel that you don’t deserve to spend time on something that is not directly making a profit or accomplishing something productive in that moment. First, use your practical abilities to assess what will actually go wrong if you spend a few hours doing something like reading a book. If it’s not much, then go for it.","You want a deeper bond with someone, but somehow it is not quite working out the way you want it to. Instead, you feel painfully conscious of being an individual -- not just separate from the other person, but alone, too. Even though this may be uncomfortable in the moment, developing this awareness of your personal limits can be helpful to this relationship or friendship over time. You will ultimately enjoy the other person more if you have a clear sense of where you end and they begin.","Although you may feel under the weather today, don’t jump into a panic that you have come down with something. Your family relationships have not been easy for you lately, and stress related to that could be finding an outlet in physical symptoms. Stay away from trying to diagnose yourself online and just get some rest. You may have to let go of the expectation that your family will nurture you in the ways you need them to, but do what you can to nurture yourself.","Miscommunications start to interfere with your ability to carry out your routine responsibilities today. Even though you mean well, it seems like everyone is taking what you say and do the wrong way. You feel not just challenged in your tasks, but misunderstood as a person. This sense of being misunderstood could have much deeper roots in you than whatever is setting you off right now, though. Explore this on your own, but keep your efforts to solve the current problems rooted in the present.","You might be drawn to pursue fun and pleasure today, but concerns about money ruin the vibe. It may be hard to sort out how much of this is grounded in your present reality and how much is old conditioning that is no longer relevant. This is a good opportunity to do a thorough review of your financial accounts and see what you truly are able to afford, in terms of entertainment or anything else. The numbers may pleasantly surprise you.","You may feel like you are the heavy one in your family today, pushing people to be serious when they would rather be more lighthearted. Maybe they are avoiding something that really needs to be dealt with, but you are not interested in solving the problem only for the moment -- you also want to find deeper, philosophical meaning in the situation. You may not be able to force everyone to share your depth today, but you could reach valuable insights, at least for yourself.","You have the opportunity to engage in pleasant chatter today, but you might not feel up to it. Important things may also get left unsaid, so you could wind up feeling lonelier than before. No one is trying to make you feel that way, it is just that your mind is on heavy matters right now; perhaps material security that you have relied upon is being threatened. Whatever is causing your bad mood, you may want to sit with it alone rather than spreading it."
2021-04-26,"We may get some surprises today, but we have enough confidence and strength to make the best of them. The Moon makes an empowering trine to optimistic Jupiter in the morning and then connects with the drive of Mars, maintaining a vibe where things get done in a way that we feel good about. Finally, at 11:32 pm EDT, the Full Moon shines its light on what may have been hiding in plain sight. We are equipped to work in a constructive way with whatever emerges.","There may be an unexpected development regarding your money or property today; perhaps someone in your family or larger social circle will ask you to use it to help them. These people are generally on your side, though. Even if they do make a request of you, what they are proposing could turn out to be a good opportunity for you, too. Consider it carefully, and be open to creating an arrangement that benefits everyone in unique ways.","An intense conversation with a significant person could clear the air between the two of you today. It might have to do with issues relating to your professional pursuits or to authority figures in your life. Even if you initiate the conversation yourself, you may not be able to control how it goes. The other person is an individual, too, and they could take the opportunity to tell you something you didn’t expect. Whatever it is, you can put a positive spin on it.","You are able to make money through work today. Your position, however, may be more behind-the-scenes than you prefer, triggering a serious mystery: If a chatty Gemini is in the forest, and nobody is around to hear them, do they make a sound? While you labor quietly, you'll have an opportunity to get in touch with your own thoughts. Thinking through a big idea by yourself could give you something to talk about the next time you converse with others.","You are more assertive than usual today, and you could be successful in asking your friends or community members to pool resources with you toward a common goal. People may not expect this side of you, but they know you wouldn’t ask unless it was important, and they are generally pleasantly surprised. They can see that whatever opportunity you are presenting is a win-win situation for everyone involved, so you have a good chance of earning their support. Go for it with confidence.","Something that has been secretly brewing in your home life might finally come out into the open today. It will probably cause a lot of upheaval in the moment, even if you had some advance warning that it was coming. Even you could find the amount of drama involved to be uncomfortable, but in the long run, the news is better out than in. Once the dust of everyone’s reactions settles, you can get a sense of how to move forward.","You don’t have to travel far to see something that broadens your understanding today. While you take care of your routine errands and responsibilities close to home, you could get clarity on a bigger political matter that has been weighing on you. Sometimes seeing how things play out in the real world answers a lot of theoretical questions. You could also wind up feeling more connected to your community as a result of what you experience and discover.","Your professional ambition may pay off today, as you receive some positive money news. An employer who sees your potential for further growth could be willing to invest in you. When you feel confident and generally good about yourself, you can make better decisions about personal finance. While you may not have full control over the size of your paycheck, what you do with it once you receive it is on you. Make a plan to invest in your own future.","A close personal or business relationship takes a prominent role in your life today. This could be a little challenging for you if you feel like your sense of control is threatened. Try not to get caught up in sorting out who is the leader and who is the follower, though. It might just be a situation where two heads are better than one for pursuing an expanded perspective. You can wind up learning a lot, even if it wasn’t entirely your idea.","Today you can get a glimpse at the hidden motivations behind some of your routine habits that you take for granted. You can still be your charmingly quirky self, but you might appreciate your unique behaviors more if you understand the story behind them. If one of your habits is making your life harder, though, this realization could help you find a more constructive outlet for the energy that is fueling it. Becoming aware of your negative patterns is the first step toward improving them.","You might be asserting yourself in your larger social sphere more than you usually do, yet you could feel a little vulnerable from the exposure. This is actually a great opportunity to actively pursue a closer connection with an acquaintance you have been curious to know better. You are showing the real you right now, so the other person knows what they would be getting and can make an informed decision about whether moving forward together would work for them. All you have to do is be authentic.","A health matter may require your attention today. Whether you are dealing with your own body or you are supporting someone else in your family, don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Although you deeply value your independence, you will not lose your autonomy if you bring others into the situation. People will be able to keep their focus on getting the job done rather than competing with each other, and your leadership will be appreciated.","Secrets have been a fulfilling part of your life lately. It can be hard to keep something you are excited about to yourself, so you might be tempted to spill it to others today. An impulsive reveal can do more harm than good, though, so think carefully about what way of asserting yourself is most in line with the philosophy that guides your life. You may have to let some news out for your own sanity, but make it a thoughtful and planned disclosure."
2021-04-27,"We experience conflict between what brings us security and what we value as the emotional Moon makes an opposition to sensuous Venus at 1:35 pm EDT. Such a challenge might otherwise seem minor, except the Moon also tangles with stern Saturn today, and this constraint may fuel a sense that there is not enough for everyone to have everything they need. Meanwhile, Pluto turns retrograde this afternoon, taking us back to review ground we've already covered on our path of transformation.","You may face criticism today because you are perceived in your community as being overly materialistic. However uncalled for this external judgment is, you might reflect on whether you are focusing on physical stuff as a substitute for what you need and are not getting emotionally. You could come to realize that your attitude is influenced by how your parents handled these things in your childhood. It’s not wrong to like what you have, but make sure you are doing it for the right reasons.","Feeling good about yourself seems to be clashing with your ability to feel secure in a relationship. Perhaps you are worried that, if you take steps to enhance your appearance, your partner or a close friend will feel threatened somehow. This sense may not be coming from the other person, though. Instead, you might be reacting to something an authority figure told you long ago. Take this as a sign to review your philosophies on life and where they came from -- some of them may no longer be helping you.","You feel secure when you attend to your day-to-day responsibilities at work and elsewhere. Still, part of you longs for something more and takes pleasure in intangible things. A rigid view of the world may be giving you the idea that you have to pick one or the other to be your focus in life, but the reality is that you need some of both. You are good at seeing opposites, but you might have to work to unite them in your life.","You really like to be liked, but how secure is your good reputation if you have to be fake to get it? You have been working hard to transform deep dynamics in your close relationships lately, and that level of intimacy has been demanding more of you as an individual. Now, it might be time for you to bring that personal growth you have undergone into your public persona. Just fix any of your contradictions on your own before others have a chance to notice them.","You might feel like a close relationship is pushing you to choose between public acclaim and domestic bliss. While you are notorious for your love of the limelight, there is also a part of you that feels secure cuddling up at home. Your path to achieving balance between these parts of your life might involve getting control over your routine. Look through your calendar and see what commitments have crept in without your awareness. Intentionally sculpt a life that works for you.","You might hit a roadblock in your attempts to learn and grow today, as you see the potential for your new views to cause conflict in some of your oldest relationships, perhaps with your siblings or childhood friends. To sort this out, ask yourself, to whom is your greater duty? You have been slowly revising your sense of self lately, and that may give you the answer. You don’t have to leave anyone out, but you need to keep your priorities clear.","Collaboration is one of your big values in life, but today you may feel inhibited from going all the way. You cannot always live up to your own lofty ideals, because you also see the security in keeping all your resources to yourself. Encountering this resistance doesn’t mean that you have failed, it is just a sign that you need to clarify the boundaries in a situation where you share with someone else. When you have the protection you need, you have room to be generous.","You may need to take some personal space from even a good relationship today. The problem with good relationships is that the people in them are easy to reason with. Therefore, they tend to be what has to give when other parts of your life are more demanding, and right now, you might be dealing with some heavy demands from your family. However you make things work, don’t take the people close to you for granted. Express your appreciation and communicate with them honestly about your situation.","Although you really enjoy sensual, physical pleasure, you are also grounded in your faith that there is more to life than that. This might be hard for the people around you to understand, as they can’t put you in a box. Someone may try to pressure you in conversation today to commit to a view of the world that is more limited than you prefer. You like to see yourself as an open book, but how you make it all work might not be their business.","You feel secure in your role in your larger community, but you may be less secure in your ability to be yourself. Refining what you truly value can help you get a clearer sense of who you are. Unfortunately, sometimes, the only way you see what you value is when others challenge it, and your community might do that for you today. Still, you may be able to use your existing status to get their support when you argue for your perspective.","Even if you have been enjoying your home life lately, you may have trouble incorporating that into your identity, as you wonder if it makes you appear not serious enough. Today, it becomes obvious that it is your professional endeavors that you look to not just for achievement, but also for emotional security. Perhaps an earlier time in your life when home was a less stable place is affecting how you see things now. Reflect on how your past might be affecting your thoughts and actions in the present.","You generally enjoy the people around you, but too much chatter with them can be too much of a good thing today. If you start to get grouchy, the cause may be that you are not getting the space for contemplation that you need to recharge. Try to notice this feeling building in you before you snap at someone. Going forward, you may need to become more intentional in how you shape your social interactions so that you do not get burned out."
2021-04-28,"We have quiet determination to unravel what blocks us today, but deciding what to do with what we learn will be more challenging. The intense Moon in Scorpio makes a sextile with powerful Pluto at 6:38 am EDT, giving us focus to work productively on tasks that are otherwise intimidating. We get on a roll and even feel grandiose as the Moon squares larger-than-life Jupiter. But Luna then enters Sagittarius, challenging Mars to an awkward conflict between freedom and sensitivity, so some answers may have to wait.","Today you can sort out secrets within your family, perhaps those involving an inheritance or other money issue. Someone may be holding on to information that you will have to carefully extract from them. After you learn what you need to know, however, you might feel torn between defending the status quo and telling the whole truth. You may not be able to fully satisfy either desire immediately, but handling information judiciously could get you more of it.","You can work out deep philosophical issues with someone close to you today. It is hard to know when to stop talking and just let things be, though. You might think that you will feel more secure if you can just pin down one more detail, but pushing the other person to a point of discomfort could damage the atmosphere of trust you have built. Although knowledge is important, maintaining the bond of your relationship should take a higher priority.","You can work hard today to get to the bottom of mysteries involving resources you share with others. Things that seem scary and confusing may not turn out to be so once you put in some focused effort. While you are willing to help others with your time and energy, however, you want to keep some of your own resources to yourself. This may appear selfish to someone close to you, but having boundaries helps you give in a way that is sustainable long-term.","You can dish it out today, but you can’t take it. You are more aggressive than usual, and you may go too far in joking around with others. This could feel like an easier way to deal with deeper problems in your relationships that are hard to address. You still feel sensitive about yourself, though, so if someone turns the joking back on you, you might get offended. It would be better for you to turn your focus toward serious solutions for your difficulties with others.","You can get a lot done around the house today, and you may have to if you have promised others more than you can deliver. You might agree to things because you want others to like you -- after all, you need accomplices to help you live up to your reputation for boisterous fun. Privately, though, you may be feeling more sensitive now and in need of validation. Even if you are not ready to admit that to others, you may find strength in at least acknowledging it to yourself.","You could find yourself happily overindulging in talking, eating, and having fun with family today. While you may be enjoying yourself in the moment, though, you might get to a point where your experience of family life comes into conflict with cultural expectations of what a family should look like. You may think yours should be more traditional, but don’t overlook the benefits of your freer, more honest approach. It is important for you to acknowledge -- at least to yourself -- the truth of what really works for you.","You can really nail down the numbers if you focus on the financial component of home and family matters today. You might discover that you have more resources than you expected, though double-check that anything extra you find is real. Using this information may be harder than acquiring it, as you could then feel constrained in speaking your piece due to your place within your family. The numbers speak louder than anyone’s ego, so truth will win eventually, even if it takes a while.","You can communicate thoughtfully about yourself today. However, the more you talk about what matters most to you, the more you may become aware of tension between qualities that you value -- like kindness or security -- and a certain philosophy that you hold. You may enjoy the community that has grown up around that philosophy, but look at whether it is actually succeeding at building a world where your values flourish. If there is a discrepancy, you may need to adjust at least one end of the conflict.","You are able to make progress on financial matters today that previously seemed daunting, because you can get a handle on what has been holding you back. You might be tempted to brag about what you are discovering, but the more you bring other people into what you are doing, the more frustrated you will be, as they will weigh in with their own opinions that throw you off the scent of your unique, personal situation. Journaling can help you to get out your thoughts without interference.","Connecting with friends is compelling for you today, and you'll generally feel seen in a good way in these interactions. Your supply of energy is not infinite, though. You may be ready for rest after an online happy hour or distanced get-together, yet a partner or other close connection wants your attention in a more active way. Be sure to balance your social opportunities with your other commitments, and leave enough time and energy to meet your legitimate obligations in other parts of your life.","You are able to channel your hidden strength into your professional endeavors today, and look good doing it. Don’t let the heat of the moment sweep you up into overpromising things for the future that you might not be able to deliver, but do use this opportunity to get a lot done while you feel up to it. The hardest part may be deciding whether to focus on networking or catching up on routine tasks. Both are necessary, so you can’t really go wrong.","You have the pleasure today of connecting with a community that is in harmony with the philosophy that guides your life. Agreement isn’t everything, but it makes everything a lot easier. The only challenge is that, with the serious side of your intellectual life fulfilled, you realize you also need lighthearted fun. You may not be able to get all your needs met in one place, but if you have the courage to ask, it could turn out that others in your community have similar cravings."
2021-04-29,"Our thoughts can catch on to subtleties and bring them to life today. We are all a little bit more intuitive than usual when intellectual Mercury makes a cooperative sextile with mysterious Neptune at 10:27 pm EDT. Emotions, however, can either help or harm this process. The Moon connects harmoniously with serious Saturn, so we can turn today’s inspiration into practical progress if we stay calm. If we look too closely at the mystery, though, the Moon’s challenge to Neptune can get us lost. We mustn't lose sight of our purpose.","Your keen intuition can help you find answers to your issues of money or self-worth today, though executing the answers might be easier than explaining how you got them. What you pick up intuitively may be hard to articulate in words, and you may not know how it fits into your larger understanding of life. Interacting with others will keep you grounded while you sit with this mystery, though you are probably better off not telling anyone about it for now.","You are the one who can put into words what everyone else is thinking today, and they will love you for it. Something taboo might be on the collective mind, and a big part of what makes taboo things scary is their vagueness -- there is not a clear sense of where the threat begins or ends. If you can give structure to something like that, it will seem less intimidating. That will be a relief to you and others.","A powerful person in your life, like a boss or parent, could seem totally unreasonable today. It would be easy for you -- and perhaps even others -- to get into a dramatic conflict with them. If you can stay calm, though, you might be able to talk some sense into them in private. You will have to listen to them first, but you can hear what legitimate need they are trying to meet through their strange behavior and help them find another way to get that need met.","You may feel martyred by your obligations toward others today. What would probably serve everyone involved better than you simply going along with it, however, is a good talk about clarifying shared responsibilities. Your own ability to come up with a clear philosophy of who is responsible for what may be fuzzy at the moment. If you look for outside advice, perhaps online, you could find a perspective that speaks to your situation and helps you put it in order.","Someone important to you may be pushing you to clarify some of the murky money parts of your professional life, such as taxes or retirement investments. You might be used to assuming that these things will just work out, but it is a good idea for you to be more aware of the details, even if that wasn’t your own idea. You are still the one who is responsible for the outcome, so do your future self a favor and get some things in order.","You might be fascinated by someone in your life lately who seems to be a really spiritual person. Whether or not your idealization of this person is an accurate view of them, the feelings they bring up in you can motivate your own growth. You tend to be focused on your achievements in the physical world, but there is clearly also a part of you that longs to get out of this comfort zone. Dare to go deep today and connect with something you can't touch or see.","It seems work has been burning you out lately, and you may need to intentionally build some fun into your routine to bring back balance. Attempts to set boundaries with your work directly might not get off the ground, but being clear about something you do want could get you further than focusing on what you don’t want. You could also look at what drew you to your work in the first place. Reconnecting with the meaning in what you do may refresh you.","Sitting with mystery can be uncomfortable, and today, you might be tempted to idealize material security to compensate for other parts of your life that seem less solid. You may, however, find acceptance for the more ambiguous parts of yourself in a nurturing close relationship. Having this ambiguity accepted can help you articulate what is going on there, but ""articulate"" doesn't have to look like an encyclopedia article. In fact, the more creatively you channel this energy, the better.","You can communicate clearly about your current identity, but describing your background is harder for you now, especially if you have moved away from it, geographically or otherwise. Getting in touch with your roots might be easier in a less verbal way. Something physical like cooking an old family recipe or playing a musical instrument in the way a relative taught you could help you reconnect -- not only with your ancestors, but with parts of yourself you have lost touch with.","A little creativity can help you turn a negative into a positive today. Though you might be drawn toward self-pity, there is another way for you to interpret events. Your material resources are basically stable at the moment, so you have room to roam intellectually. Allow yourself to identify as a hero who conquers all the challenges in your path. Ups and downs may not always be fun in real life, but there is no successful book or movie plot without them. You can be victorious.","Sticking to a budget might be hard for you today, as enticing opportunities emerge to spend on your family or home. It's ok to deal with the excitement of the moment in whatever way feels right to you now and worry about the details later. You don’t have to go all the way to the extreme of other people you know who seem to spend without any inhibitions whatsoever, but reminding yourself of them might make you feel better about being a bit more flexible now.","You are still on a journey when it comes to understanding your identity, and you can do a good job communicating about this journey today. You might especially be able to articulate complicated feelings you have about an authority figure who shaped your life. You may or may not still idealize this person, but you can see now how their intimidating pronouncements came from relatable human anxieties. Feeling empathy for them will be a big change from looking up to them."
2021-04-30,"We become actively engaged in revolutionary change as the Sun meets up with innovative Uranus at 3:54 pm EDT. What's more, the Moon is fueled by expansive Jupiter, sending us confidently in the direction of our dreams. In the evening, though, when the Moon challenges touchy Mars, we feel the hard parts of trying something new. If we want to change anything except THAT, undoubtedly someone we know has an eye on just THAT. Attachment challenges everyone, even the confident people.","You can make an assertive money move today, and you may gain confidence from feeling that your social circle is impressed with what you are doing. Your family’s reaction may be more difficult, however, as they may be triggered somehow by your independence. Of course, you should not take unreasonable risks with money that is earmarked for family needs, but as long as that is not what you did, you do not have any reason to feel guilty.","You can impress authority figures with what you have to say today -- or maybe you have just decided that you are an authority! You are inclined to say exactly what is on your mind, especially if it is controversial. Someone will probably answer the challenge to argue with you, but they might wish they had not, as you have a boundless supply of energy to fight back. Enjoy letting out your inner T-Rex for a rampage, but don’t eat anyone you would later miss.","You can take initiative toward a secret goal of yours today. One of your first steps, however, might involve getting clarity on the resources you share with others. Keeping such a discussion calm can be challenging, especially if others involved feel that you are pushing them. They might lash out against you by picking at little details, but it will help you to stay focused on the situation’s bigger picture. If you can negotiate a broad, philosophical agreement, the details should fall into place.","Close relationships can be contentious for you today, as perhaps a news story or something you see on social media provokes a fight. If you have the patience, though, you can make progress toward intimacy and working out your deeper issues. The other person will likely not initiate such a discussion and may be reluctant to engage at first, but if you really push for it for the good of the relationship, both of you may ultimately be relieved by the outcome.","You have a unique opportunity to take action in a way that has real authority today. Make sure you use your chance to make a difference for something that is truly worth it. While it may be tempting to use official force to crush the petty frustrations that get under your skin, you should instead focus on building improbable relationships that will help you make progress toward your major life goals. Take a chance on someone who seems interesting, even if they are outside your usual circle.","Social media could be a hotbed of aggression for you today. You might feel personally attacked, whether or not that was what others intended, and escalate from there. You also wish that everyone else saw things the same way you do, even if you only came to hold those views fairly recently yourself. Unfortunately, you cannot control how quickly others find clarity, so try to shift your focus to the things in your life that you can control.","You might want to assertively pursue your professional ambitions today, but you feel constrained by what your family needs from you at home. The way out for you may involve looking for innovative ways to merge resources with others. Perhaps someone else who is in a situation similar to yours could collaborate with you. The best collaborator may turn out to be someone you would not expect, so think outside the box and you might be able to make it work.","Today, you might take a more active role in a relationship that has been more stimulating than you prefer lately. It helps that you are approaching the situation from a place of relative stability, as opposed to being totally dependent on the other person for your basic needs, but you do want to get a better idea of what is going on between the two of you. A “define the relationship” talk might not be entirely comfortable, but it could be productive.","Someone else might put their foot down today on how much you are spending from a shared purse on a personal habit of yours. This could surprise you, because money may not be the first thing you think of in regards to that habit -- you are probably so focused on maximizing something else, like health or productivity, that you don’t pay attention to what it costs. If you still find value in keeping the habit, you should probably figure out how to fund it yourself.","A close relationship could be difficult for you today, as you feel like the other person is pushing you to fit a particular mold. You might have fit that mold well enough not long ago, but now you crave flexibility. You want more freedom to rework yourself as you get in touch with what you really deeply value. It would be easy for you to get mad at the other person, but you may be more frustrated with the inconvenience of your own needs. Try to maintain some perspective.","A surprise at home could disrupt your routine today. This disruption might trigger a major conflict over chores, as it exposes a deeper unfairness in the way your household divides responsibilities. Under normal circumstances, it is easy to take the way things are for granted, so it's likely the injustice has been going on due to obliviousness and not malice. As unpleasant as the conflict may be in the moment, hashing it out could ultimately deliver an outcome that is more equitable in your favor.","Your thoughts are full of fresh inspiration -- the challenge is deciding who to share them with. Your social community is important to you, but you may feel that your security there depends on you staying in your place and deferring to others rather than asserting yourself. There is also more potential for your insights to be misunderstood in a large group setting now, where the conversation might move onward before necessary clarifying questions can be asked, so you are better off keeping your communications more intimate for now."
2021-05-01,"There’s a jolt of energy as the day begins, waking us up with a bit of a shake. The intuitive Moon in goal-oriented Capricorn forms a harmonious angle with innovative Uranus at 6:13 am EDT, setting the stage for a thrilling experience and sparking brilliant ideas that seem to come out of nowhere. Only an hour later, the Moon will follow up with another trine to the primal Sun, encouraging us to use this energy to our advantage.","Take a different approach to life today and you’ll find you’re rewarded for it, Aries. There’s a special spark in the heavens above, and it’ll be impacting matters of career and finances for you, so take that fresh energy and see if you can’t bring it with you to the office, or wherever it is you earn your money. Don’t worry about getting performance anxiety; anyone keeping an eye on you will be very impressed with your clever take on the work before you.","There are rewards waiting outside your comfort zone. Open up your mind to different ideas today -- the more unusual they are, the better they’ll help you get to where you want to be. Earth signs like yours tend to stick to what's tried and true, but if you step outside your usual lane, you’ll find it brings you more emotional satisfaction than you could have anticipated. It’s not every day you discover something new about yourself, but this is one to try and see what you can learn.","There’s something tickling your brain where you can’t see it, but you can sense it... It would be best if you don’t try to figure out what’s causing it, rather just let it play out on its own. It’s like trying to untangle a necklace; sometimes, the knot is just impossible to undo, but if you leave it in your pocket and forget about it, it will loosen up on its own. Take this sort of approach today, and you’ll untangle something important.","People generally know what to expect from you, because you’re pretty open and clear with your emotions, but every once in a while it wouldn’t hurt to give them a bit of a shock. You don’t need to act out or pull some big stunt to shake people out of their comfort zones, but if you take a slightly different approach to how you present yourself today, it will be for the best; people will be happy to see you through fresh eyes.","This could be an incredibly productive day for you, and you don’t want to leave any of this energy untended, so avoid hitting the snooze button and, instead, get up and get moving. Start your day early with a jog or yoga or some other type of activity that will help you get any leftover sleep out of your eyes. This will create a healthy and active buzz that will stick with you the whole day, propelling you along toward your goals.","You aren't willing to give your energies to anything that doesn’t totally send you over the Moon today, so don’t ask too much of yourself, at least with regards to other people’s expectations. The planets are encouraging you to chase after your own dreams and put them front and center for everyone else to see, so what are you waiting for? Step out of the wings and put on a show, but one that is entirely on your own terms.","Getting up at the crack of dawn might not be your idea of a good time, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t good for you. Instead of lingering in bed today, get up and get busy, because the planets are encouraging you to shake up your routine and show the world what you can do, rather than waiting for anyone to tell you. Pump yourself up with whatever activity energizes you most in the morning, then get going on a proactive and productive day.","Don’t be shocked if you wake up and find your phone is already buzzing with people trying to get your attention, but don’t feel obligated to respond right away, either. Just because you own a phone doesn’t mean you need to be constantly looking at it, or that you’re constantly available. It’s a good idea to set some boundaries today, even if that just means reminding people that you like to do things on your own schedule, not theirs; they’ll understand.","You’ve got money on your mind today, but even if you don’t have work to tend to, that doesn’t mean you can just rest on your laurels and expect things to happen. You're one of the resident go-getters of the zodiac, so live up to your reputation and chase after something exciting that really lights a fire under you -- preferably something regarding your finances. Opportunities are out there, but you have to track them down yourself, because people won’t deliver them unasked.","Is it just you, or does it seem that a lot of people are noticing you right now? In fact, you’re not imagining things, because the planets are putting the focus on you and encouraging others to become aware of your stellar qualities, especially those that they might have missed while tending to their own business. Although you could just enjoy the extra attention, if you've been looking for a spotlight moment, this is your chance to put on a show.","Although we live in a very busy society that expects everyone to be plugged in all the time, make a choice today to take your time and to consciously unplug. If you must, pretend you live in a time and place where screens and algorithms didn’t dictate so much of how we live. Move into the slow lane and get in touch with the more natural side of life. A long walk in nature, listening to nothing but the wind in the trees, will be especially rejuvenating.","A fun opportunity might pop up close to home today, so don’t think you need to go far or plan a big adventure to have something exciting in your life. Good times are on the way, and they’ll be happening nearby, so make a point of checking out what is happening in your own neighborhood or town. You could meet some new people who instantly feel like kindred spirits, bringing you a much-needed sense of camaraderie and connection."
2021-05-02,"There’s an intense vibration channeling through the air as mental Mercury trines introspective Pluto this morning, making it easy for us to peel back the layers and see what’s playing beneath the surface. The emotional Moon won’t let anyone ruminate on these heavy energies for too long, however, as it moves into cerebral Aquarius in the afternoon. While this change might leave some of us reeling, once pleasure-loving Venus forms a supportive angle with healing Neptune at 6:38 pm EDT, the evening settles into a calmer note.","Beware pushing too hard on the work front today; you can go and go and go, but if you push too hard, you might knock someone out of the way without even meaning to. Instead of acting like a human bumper car, see if you can reach the top all on your own -- as in, you make the ascent without impacting anyone else. It’s all about you and your goals, but that doesn’t mean other people need to be shoved aside for you to succeed.","Even if you don’t think of yourself as much of a student, there is always room to learn something new -- to learn something that expands your worldview and gives you a better understanding of the structures that surround you and make up your reality. Today, look beyond what you know and seek out some topic of interest that has been sitting on the backburner or at the back of your mind for too long. There are rewards to be had if only you look for them.","Your vision might seem especially narrow today, despite the fact you normally try to look at the world broadly and with open eyes. If it feels like you’re running through a dark tunnel, it’s important to keep in mind that all tunnels must end eventually and that you can only go so far before you reach the light. Even if you can’t see it just yet, it is there, so keep going and soon you’ll emerge into a beautiful and glowing new place.","Someone might try to pull you away from your plans today, or perhaps it’s your plans that pull you away from someone when you’d rather keep it just the two of you. Even if you had an idea of how things should go, give yourself permission to employ a bit of creativity and freedom in your approach to life, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised with the results. Let people lead you, and realize that sometimes a detour is a blessing.","Conversations revolving around your work will be especially fruitful today. If you’ve been formulating ideas about your climb up the professional ladder, this is the time to go on and say your piece. A VIP or boss will be especially receptive to you, so do your best to put yourself in their line of vision, so that when the right opportunity pops up, you can spark the conversation and put on an impressive show. You’ve got this, Leo.","It’s easy to build up walls and shield ourselves from the influence of people and other outside forces, in an effort to feel stable and secure. Today though, you’re better off turning in the opposite direction and trying to break down walls and past ways of thinking that are keeping you trapped in outdated patterns -- whether you know they are or not. Take a wrecking ball to your old ways and create enough space for you to really stretch.","This isn’t a day for the faint-hearted, but that doesn’t mean it has to bowl you over. Instead of trying to stand up to any intense emotions or difficult conversations, do your best to lean into them and embrace them with every fiber in your body, because what might seem a bit daunting at first could turn out to be far more satisfying than you’d have anticipated. Have the courage to “go there” today, and you’ll be happy you did.","You’ve got a lot to tend to today, and while it’s good to keep busy, it’s not great when all those matters start to pile up and become something more than you’re willing to work on. Instead of looking at these tasks as something you have to do on your own, try and figure out what loads can be shared with someone else. Look around and don’t be scared to ask; people want to help, but they need to know you need it.","There’s work to be done today, so instead of chasing after good times, get to your workspace, roll up your sleeves, and get cracking. While this might not seem like a lot of fun at the start, if you keep your nose to the grindstone, you could wind up accomplishing more than you ever anticipated. There’s a lot of progress to be made if only you apply yourself, so take a raincheck on any fun invitations -- you'll thank yourself later.","It’s a wonderful day to do as you please without paying attention to what anyone else might say or think. While it can be good to keep your ear open to public opinion, that doesn’t mean you always need to live up to others' expectations, and this day, in particular, is a terrific one to assert your individuality, as well as your innate creativity. Don’t worry so much about creating a final product, just focus on expressing yourself, whatever that might mean to you.","Don’t be shocked if you wake up with your dreams still fogging your head. In fact, the whole of today might feel like a bit of a dreamscape, so rather than trying to shake off the fantastical vapors leftover from your nocturnal wanderings, bring that dreamy frame of mind with you into your day and your interactions with other people. Wander around a bit mentally and see where it leads you; from the look of things, it’ll be quite inspiring.","Someone in your social circle might try to establish themselves as the top banana today, but do they really deserve that roll? That isn’t to say you should go around questioning each and every person’s abilities, but if someone starts pushing others around without any good reason, then that’s no good for anyone. While you tend to go with the flow generally, don’t be afraid to stick up for yourself today -- and others, too. You can be a warrior when you need to be."
2021-05-03,"There is a bit of push-pull energy in the heavens today, so it’s rather difficult for us to figure out just which direction we’re headed in. Early in the morning, messenger Mercury will square off with expansive Jupiter, making our thoughts larger than life, only for the Sun to then square off with hardworking Saturn shortly after, weighing us down with pressure and responsibility. The energy will speed up in the evening, however, as Mercury zooms into its home sign of Gemini, encouraging us to speak our truths.","It’s wonderful when you have this much drive and firepower pushing you forward, encouraging you to work hard and really earn your worth. However, just because you’re chugging along at full speed doesn’t mean other people will be on the same track as you. Today, it looks as though someone, or perhaps a group of people, might stand in the way of your natural productive urges. It’s good to not listen too much to any naysayers in the peanut gallery; they just don’t understand.","Life feels like it's going your way, or at least you’re filled with a new sense of purpose, largely thanks to the Sun shining in your sign. Today, however, you might find that your responsibilities get in the way of chasing after something more pleasurable. A boss or other VIP might come calling, expecting you to drop everything and come to their aid. It doesn’t have to be problematic, though; in fact, you might be able to hit this one out of the park.","Today might leave you feeling like the main character in a fairy tale, wandering down a mysterious path to who knows where. It’s perfectly fine to check out from reality and go with the flow, but if you wander too far, you might not like where you wind up. Don't hold back, but with each step, make sure you take your time and acclimate to your surroundings, or else the path might become too dark to see in front of you.","Putting forth the effort to smile and play and act like a fun person will feel more exhausting than usual today. There’s nothing wrong with being a little extra sensitive or worn down, so don’t spend time trying to fake a different mood around other people, because it’s going to take more out of you than you have to give right now. Check out for the day, then touch base later when you’re feeling more like your usual self.","You have your ambitions set high, seeking out a lofty place from which you can show everyone around you just how capable and competent you are. Today, however, someone might come out of the woodwork to block your ascent, or at least throw a roadblock in your way. Your reaction could alter the outcome, so be graceful about this disruption. Show this person that no one can ruffle a Leo’s feathers no matter how hard they might try.","As disciplined a sign as you are, Virgo, sometimes you want to just throw everything in the air and let loose, ignoring the problems awaiting your careful attention. Today, it’s perfectly alright if you want to escape to places unknown rather than rolling up your sleeves and getting to work. Despite these urges, though, it looks as though some issue will, indeed, come calling, requiring you to put in your effort. Solve the problems before you, then you can do as you please.","As a rule, your sign tends to put up a pleasant front and keep everyone getting along to the best of your ability. That’s lovely, but it isn’t something you should always expect of yourself, or force yourself to do if you aren’t in the mood to. Any efforts you make today to please everyone else will only leave you feeling less than pleased with yourself, so make a point not to overextend your energies -- they’d be best conserved for later use.","Issues surrounding home and hearth might pop up today, and while you would certainly prefer to avoid any dust-ups, that doesn’t mean it is going to happen. If you find you can’t get enough space or that a family member or roommate keeps stepping on your toes, the best solution is to make whatever space you can, perhaps by going out for a jog or engaging in some cardio to blow off some steam. Take a step back today, then return to people tomorrow.","Your list of things to do is looking exceptionally long today. While this might be daunting, you can still accomplish everything on it as long as you’re efficient and organized in your approach. There might be a few distractions, like people calling for your attention, but do your best to stay disciplined, because that is the only way you’ll finish everything. Once you do finish everything, you'll feel more relaxed and free to do as your heart pleases.","Just because your sign is known for its work ethic doesn’t mean you don’t want to have fun every once in a while, just like everyone else. With the Sun barreling through your passion and creativity sector right now, you generally have cosmic clearance to go after whatever you want, without considering the pressing responsibilities of daily life -- except for today, that is. Today, important obligations are calling and the fun will have to wait until your work is complete.","There’s a disconnect between your emotional state and how you express yourself today, which might leave you feeling like you’re in a bit of a quagmire, trying to make sense of your feelings. What feels right in the moment may not be your normal way of going about things, but if you only do things the way you’ve always done them, you might not ever get very far. Be willing to try a different path today, unloading any emotional baggage you have foisted upon yourself.","Your mind is all over the place today, which means it’s going to be rather difficult to figure out how you feel about various topics. If people come seeking your opinion, don’t feel pressured to give them an answer right away; you have every right to take a few days and mull things over, because that is the best way to make sure you know where you stand on the matter. Ask for time; people will be willing to give it."
2021-05-04,"Although we may spend much of the day in our minds, the emotional Moon's tense beam from romantic Venus at 12:00 noon EDT gives us a craving for some old-world luxury and love. The evening will be even more exciting, as the Moon connects with optimistic and bountiful Jupiter before slipping into fantastical Pisces. Jupiter and Venus both want us to have as much fun as possible today, we'll just need to be careful not to go overboard.","You can look forward to a fun and uplifting day while the Moon is spinning through your friendship sector and aligning beautifully with happy-go-lucky Jupiter. Instead of taking on things by yourself, make a point to link up with your nearest and dearest, or even some more casual acquaintances who could become better friends given a bit of time and attention. This could be a night to remember, so you won't want to spend it alone.","The planets are encouraging you to set your sights high today, and with a number of heavenly bodies making moves through your career sector, there’s no reason to sit this one out. The Moon will align with abundant Jupiter this evening, so even though you might find yourself burning the midnight oil, you’ll be more than willing to roll up your sleeves and get to work. You can make great leaps up life’s great ladder today.","The stars are coming together in your expansive and worldly 9th House of Foreign Cultures today, encouraging you to look beyond your usual territory and see what inspiration you can mine from people with backgrounds vastly different than your own. This same part of your chart rules higher education, so you may also want to play the armchair explorer, cracking open a book on a place you’ve always dreamed of going to. Jupiter is lifting the mood today, so go on and think big.","Your emotions are on the line today and things are far from light and breezy as your ruling planet, the intuitive Moon, spends much of the day in your intense 8th House of Intimacy and Shared Resources. That doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy yourself; you most certainly can, especially in tandem with someone special, but the fun will likely come at night when the Moon aligns with expansive Jupiter, making your desires larger than life. Go ahead and voice your deepest yearnings; people will listen.","Matters of equality and agreement are up for inspection as the Moon spends most of the day moving through the part of your chart associated with partnerships and contracts. People might come your way with some really exciting offers, and you should make a point to look at them with extra care and focus. You’ve got the universe's permission today to sign your name on the dotted line, just make sure you read all the fine print first.","You’re in your element today as the Moon moves through your 6th House of Wellness and Routine, which just so happens to be Virgo’s natural territory. Be prepared to work hard and efficiently, but that doesn’t mean you have to turn yourself into a workhorse without any pleasure in your day. The more efficient you are, the more time you can set aside to pamper yourself later, so make a point to reward yourself in the evening for a day of progress and productivity.","You’ve got every reason to look forward to a day of fun and expression as the planets are activating the part of your chart associated with creativity and enjoyment. Make a point to put a personal touch on everything you do, and even pamper yourself a little bit along the way. An especially lovely evening is in store as the Moon connects with lucky Jupiter, so don't be afraid to gamble on yourself; you could win big.","You are inclined to nest at home and tend to your own needs today, rather than charging out into the world to make a name for yourself or prove just how much you can achieve. Your 4th House of Home and Family is activated by both the Moon and happy Jupiter, bringing luck and cheer to your living space and to your family relationships. A night of fun and games with loved ones or roommates will allow you to make the most of these good vibes.","There’s a flurry of activity happening for you as the Moon spends the majority of the day in your busy 3rd House of Information and Interaction. There will be a lot on your plate, but it looks as though you’ll have all the support you need to get through every task in front of you. Once you’ve checked off all the items on your list, you’ll have the freedom and peace of mind to enjoy something more pleasurable.","There's a lot happening in your money sector today, but this energy is less about earning and more about spending. You’ll be extra inclined to splurge thanks to a connection between the Moon and Venus that makes it hard to resist any shiny objects. Just be smart and peruse some websites looking for the best deals, so that you know you’re getting your money’s worth. You just may come across something that you simply have to have.","You’ve got plenty of energy thanks to the Moon sailing through your sign for most of the day. Hop out of bed first thing and make a point to look your best -- especially around mid-day when Venus focuses even more attention on you. You have permission to do whatever you want and whatever makes you feel good now. Even if you want to share your time with someone special, don't lose sight of your own needs.","Your intuition is activated and things might feel a bit mystical for much of the day. Just go with the flow and you’ll be sure to encounter some pleasant situations, especially near mid-day when sweet Venus reaches out to the Moon from your communications sector; make a lunch date with a good friend or another special someone, and take your time catching up. Your greatest opportunities will come through others today, so make a point to connect with people."
2021-05-05,"It may be difficult for us to stop daydreaming and get down to the tasks at hand, because the Moon is floating through soft and easy Pisces all day. Fortunately, a harmonious trine from energizing Mars at 12:07 pm EDT gives us the fresh jolt we need to cross the finish line. The Moon goes on to form a helpful sextile with Uranus, the planet of surprise, so there’s good reason to approach tonight with a bit of impromptu creativity and spontaneity.","Your emotions might get the better of you today, but that doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing. If it feels like you’re all over the place, or simply more sensitive than usual, you can chalk it up to the fact that the Moon and Mars are activating the emotional sectors of your chart. However, the angle between these two planets is quite pleasant, so perhaps all those feelings are actually a good thing. There’s nothing wrong with a good cry; you’ll feel lighter.","Today might feel like a carnival ride as you try to create some semblance of order in your social life. Just about everyone in your contact list is going to be hitting you up for one reason or another, so any plans or outstanding chores might have to get pushed to the backburner as you try to get back to everyone. While this could seem distracting at first, you will be pleasantly surprised when people bring some important information your way. Listen up!","You can really shine at work today, so whether or not you’ve actually got any projects in front of you, roll up your sleeves and show people just how capable you are. Your career and financial situations are both supported right now. If you’re currently looking for employment or hoping to change jobs, a terrific new opportunity could present itself today, so keep your eyes and ears open. There is no mountain too high for you to climb.","The horizon is calling to you and you should do your best to look beyond your immediate surroundings for new stimulation. Even if you can’t travel far right now, it’s a great time to plan a future trip, searching out exotic locations that speak to you. In the meantime, take your mind on an adventure by reading up on a topic you’ve always been curious about. There are many ways to expand your world, and they'll all be satisfying now.","There is a strong vibration in the air, and while it is a positive energy, it is impacting you in rather sensitive places, so it would be best to take things one step at a time and check in with yourself along the way, making sure not to push yourself. If an opportunity to try something new pops up, there’s no reason not to take it, but you don't have to rush or force anything, either. Do what makes you comfortable.","It's a beautiful day to create and nurture new relationships, whether they are platonic, romantic, or professional. Link up with your friends if you can, and don't shy away from meeting new people -- the more you open up, the more they will, too. Your technology sector is also highlighted today, so connecting with people online or over the phone makes perfect sense. You don't have to be together in person to create an atmosphere of acceptance and admiration.","Get an early start on the day if you can, because your daily routine and wellness habits are supported now. An opportunity to make a name for yourself at work could also emerge, and while it would be nice to have prior warning, this situation won’t be giving you a friendly heads-up, so stay alert. Be ready at any moment to put on your game face and show everyone around you just how capable you are.","You have full permission today to chase after your own desires and do as you please, so don’t worry about listening to what other people have to say. That doesn’t mean you should completely ignore them or tell them where to go, but this truly is a gold-star day for having fun, so if life has felt a little dull lately, or lacking in pleasure, do whatever you can to bring some joy your way; it’s waiting for you to grab it.","Some of the most private parts of your chart are activated today, reminding you to keep your cards close to your chest, because some people might be trying to peek at your hand and see what you’ve got to work with. There’s nothing entirely wrong with that, but you’re not going to be willing to share every last detail and secret you’ve got hidden away. Let people in at your own discretion and take all relationships one step at a time now.","Brilliant ideas are bubbling on the front burner as the Moon stimulates your communication sector. While you tend to sit on things until you’re absolutely ready to share them with the world, it would actually behoove you to take some of those concepts that are only half-formed right now and share them with others. People will have some very useful advice for you, and perhaps be able to identify some of your blind spots, so be open to sharing your thoughts-in-progress.","Opportunities are waiting for you to claim them, and those opportunities are coming through your work and finances, so if you’ve been hoping to get a better grip on those matters, now is the time. Don’t sit back and rest on your laurels because there is work to be done, and the sooner you get things in order, the sooner you'll be in a position to accept new blessings. Buckle down, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how much you can accomplish.","All eyes are on you while the Moon moves through your sign, and while this isn’t normally your cup of tea, why not take advantage of this energy and see what you can gain from it? Instead of avoiding the spotlight, take a step forward and claim it. You don’t need to make a spectacle of yourself in order for people to be impressed by you; just be yourself and everyone will surely be charmed. You never know where some of this attention may lead."
2021-05-06,"There’s an intense yet exciting vibration powering up the skies as pleasure-loving Venus aligns in a harmonious trine with alchemical Pluto at 7:25 am, encouraging us to lead with our hearts, as well as our wallets. We should watch out for power struggles surrounding romance and finances, but it also might become possible to assert ourselves in these areas in ways we normally cannot. Thankfully, the Moon will come together with dreamy Neptune in the afternoon, helping to ease any tension Pluto has stirred up.","It appears you’ve become a bit of a workhorse lately, and it's important to take time out of the hectic rat race to give yourself space to just chill. Take this day to focus on self-care and set aside time to really nurture yourself. Even if you can’t dedicate a whole day to spa treatments and meditation, a half hour of quiet time can do real wonders for your spirit. You’ll be able to go that much further in the future.",A relationship with a friend may be feeling a bit strained. If there are any people in your life who seem to be walking on eggshells for you -- or perhaps it’s the other way around -- today would be a good time to extend a kind word and see if you two can’t become more comfortable with one another and patch up any misunderstandings that might be bogging you down. There's healing energy in the air that will make it easy to soothe any ruffled feathers.,"You are skilled in coming up with lots of ways to do something, but if you have too many possible paths in front of you, it may be impossible to wind up exactly where you want to. Take some time today to focus on where exactly you’re aiming to get to, then make sure the path you’re currently on is the best one to lead you there. If it seems you’ve been on the wrong course, then it’s time to make a correction.","You get by with a little help from your friends, but today, it might seem like you get by with a lot of help. A pal, or even a number of them, could emerge from the woodwork when you least expect it, offering you the assistance you’ve been needing to make your dreams come true. Even if you don’t feel like you’re lacking in this area, you will be surprised by how much people can bring into your life if you only give them the chance.","There is a lot of progress to be made today, and that progress will lead to rewards if you only put in the effort, so roll up your sleeves and get to work. Don’t worry that it is going to be difficult or stressful, however -- thanks to a beautiful alignment between Venus and Pluto in your career sectors, you won’t even break a sweat; not unless you want to. There’s money on the table, Leo, so reach out and take it.","There's the potential for drama today, so don’t let anyone pull the wool over your eyes. That’s not to say that someone means to try and trick you or that you need to be overly suspicious, but if someone offers you a deal that seems too good to be true, then it probably is indeed just that. If they press you to take them up on it, ask for time before you offer a response. Don’t let anyone rush you.","You are blessed with drive, energy, and passion today thanks to an exceptionally powerful alignment involving your ruling planet, Venus. A very rare opportunity is being granted to you to reach out for whatever you might desire and take hold of it with all your strength. This is certainly not a time to sit back on your laurels; you have the power to move mountains under this energy, so don’t miss this chance to advance your interests.","As a Scorpio, you often prefer to do things on your own, but today, you will benefit from partnering up with someone who has qualities that you, yourself, might be lacking. It’s never fun to try and identify our own weaknesses, but push yourself to meditate for a moment on the matters that keep you limited. If you acknowledge them and find someone who compliments them, then you’re going to be that much more effective. Your Wonder Twin is out there.","You have a chance to earn a reward for a job well done while both your work and money sectors are supported. Whether or not you have paid work to tend to, make a point to really dedicate yourself to the tasks in front of you. You don’t have to do this by yourself; if you have co-workers or other supporters who can help, then go ahead and ask them; you’ll be more productive together than apart. Don’t let this opportunity get away.","The universe wants you to follow your heart today and not let anything keep you from your passions. Whatever you dream of, whatever brings you joy, go on and make it the center of your day. Spend some time being creative, then some time indulging in yourself -- perhaps even changing up your appearance with a few splurges -- then top it off with time with someone you care about. You have a ticket to a cosmic pleasure cruise, so hop on board.","Your fantasies are rich and rewarding right now, so take some time away from reality and give yourself permission to daydream, seeking out inspiration in places you don’t normally look. There’s some beautiful nugget of gold circulating somewhere outside of your conscious, just beyond where you can see it, but if you let your mind wander, you may get a better sense of it. Go on and see what magical places you can discover within you.","You could have a really lovely time today thanks to a platonic pal, or even a whole group of them. Friendly interactions and the sharing of ideas are especially rewarding now. The universe is bringing bounty your way, so perhaps a friend will turn you on to a new opportunity, be it professional, romantic, or otherwise. If no one is knocking on your metaphorical door, reach out to people in your circle and you’ll be sure to discover something truly lovely."
2021-05-07,"We awake with memories of pleasant dreams thanks to the intuitive Moon's early morning alignment with sweet Venus. But at 7:52 am EDT, the Moon zips into fiery Aries, turning up the heat and increasing the pace of the general energy. We have more drive than normal, so we should take this inspirational energy as far as we possibly can. Once the Moon forms a supportive sextile with communicator Mercury this evening, fulfillment comes when we reach out and interact with others.","You are a bit more sensitive with the Moon entering your sign today, but also a bit more tuned in to what is happening around you. Although you may feel like simply stewing in your emotions for a few hours, try and find a good outlet for all these feelings, perhaps with an activity that makes you build up a sweat. Spend the evening catching up with a friend -- though you don’t want to burden them with oversharing, feel free to speak your truth.","You may feel a little disconnected from the world as the Moon moves into your subconscious sector today. Instead of trying to fight against this, let the dreamy vibrations wash over you and allow your mind to wander into fantastical territory, taking some time to pamper yourself along the way. Come the evening, financial matters take over your thoughts and you may be able to come up with new moneymaking ideas or a fresh approach to an existing money issue.","You feel fired up and inspired by collective energy today as your social life is activated by the Moon moving into your friendship sector. Link up for brunch with a few people if you can, at a distance or over Zoom, or make plans for later in the day when the Moon connects with talkative Mercury, now in your sign. You can have a really fun evening chatting, laughing, and sharing stories, if you just make contact.","You're being supported up the professional ladder by the universe today, and it looks like it won’t be too difficult to make progress. With the Moon entering your career sector early in the morning, you have the whole day to show people how capable you are and why they should trust you with more responsibilities. In fact, an inspiring and lucrative idea or project could come your way when you least expect it, so stay hopeful and ready.","You have the urge to strike out into unknown territory this morning as the Moon zips into your 9th House of Wanderlust. The thought of foreign countries and far-off vistas will be far more appealing than dealing with any chores or responsibilities that are waiting for you. If you can, dive into a book on a new subject or start planning a trip for the future. If there's a friend you want to take along, make the planning a social activity. You deserve something to look forward to.","The day dawns on a rather intense note as the Moon settles into your 8th House of Intimacy and Sharing. The bonds you share with someone, be they contractual or sexual, come up for inspection today, and you might find yourself shying away from dealing with them. You can try to stick your head in the sand, but this issue will be hard to avoid. Instead, roll up your sleeves and face the music; resolution comes through communication now.","A lot can come from joining forces with someone else today. A business partner or close friend may bring some news your way that gets something ticking away at the back of your brain, starting off a spark of inspiration. Throw some ideas back and forth and see if you can turn this spark into a broader or more cohesive concept. Two minds are better than one, so start brainstorming -- you really may be on to something now.","The stars are encouraging you to get your act together, starting first thing as the Moon zooms into your work and health sector. Beginning your day with a little physical activity will not only energize you, it'll also set a positive and productive tone that will carry you forward. If you make a point to take control of the day, things will only become easier as you go along, so don’t rest on your laurels when you should be working hard.","You are meant to enjoy yourself today, so don’t go dampening your own positive mood in an effort to make more progress. The Moon moves into your fun and creativity sector this morning, putting you in an undeniably good mood. Take an artistic approach to the day, and if you can put your personal touch on the tasks in front of you, so much the better. Put yourself front and center and let people see what you’ve got to offer.","There’s a cozy mood to the day as the Moon begins her journey through your home and family sector. Take your time doing things today and be sure to take care of yourself along the way. Don’t push yourself to do anything you don’t want to, but instead, approach things as you feel inclined, picking and choosing without being too critical. Come evening, you'll feel most fulfilled nesting with your nearest and dearest and calling it an early night.","There's a lot on your plate today, be it meetings or appointments or just people hitting up your phone before you’ve even rubbed the sleep out of your eyes. Make sure to take a few moments for yourself throughout the day, because you’re going to be on a pretty fast track and will need some breaks to maintain your energy and focus. There’s a lovely evening waiting for you, so keep that in your sights as you zip through the day.","A spotlight shines on your finances today -- both on making money and spending it. If you’re on the lookout for a new stream of revenue, this is a good time to start searching one out, but it’s also a lovely time to open your wallet and spend a little. Don’t waste your hard-earned cash on something frivolous or short-lived, however -- you'll get a lot more out of something that will only get better with age."
2021-05-08,"Our feelings get a boost of forward momentum as the Moon moves through active Aries, but there may be some crossed wires as she squares off with aggressive Mars in the wee hours, adding tension to the atmosphere. Venus is in charge for the rest of the day, however, starting with her square to expansive Jupiter that makes it easy to color outside the lines and put our worries on the backburner. At 10:01 pm EDT, she’ll enter communicative Gemini, making our love languages even more talkative.","Moderation in all things, including moderation. Pleasure-loving Venus and bountiful Jupiter are at a cross-purpose today, but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Both these planets want to enjoy themselves, and with Venus in your money sector and Jupiter impacting your social life, this would be a great time to get together with a friend for a day of safe palling around. The only caveat is not to overspend; it’s nice to cover the tab, but not if it puts you in the red.","Although you may not be in the mood to roll up your sleeves and get down to work, Venus and Jupiter team up today to remind you of all the responsibilities -- as well as the opportunities -- that are waiting for you. A chance to put yourself front and center could come your way, and in the process, you can show people just how capable you are. Just be sure to add your own personal spin to whatever you do.","Life might feel like a walk through Wonderland today as lovely Venus moves through the tail-end of your subconscious sector, before entering your sign late tonight. However, when bountiful Jupiter reaches out to Venus from your 9th House of Wanderlust, you are reminded of all the opportunities that are waiting for you out in the great wide yonder. Instead of waiting for pleasure to come to you, take the reins and go find it for yourself.","It appears you’ve been reconnecting with your friends and establishing fresh connections as of late, but there’s a change in the wind this evening as Venus slips out of your friendship zone and into your sleepy subconscious sector. Allow your mind and heart to wander, because good feelings will come when you embrace your dreams and imagination. Life will feel more like a fantasy, so go ahead and dip your toe in the water; it’s time to make waves.","It appears you've been busy pushing your way up the great career ladder lately, but that mood shifts drastically today as Venus leaves your professional realm and moves into the part of your chart that governs your friendships and social relations. If you’ve been cut off from the people in your life while you've been hard at work, now is the perfect time to come back together and enjoy one another’s company in the safest way you can; people have missed you.","Adventure has been calling your name nonstop lately, but it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get to work as Venus dives into your career zone today, helping you make a name for yourself without much fuss. Venus has a way of easing the path in front of you, making VIPs and supervisors look on you even more kindly than usual. Your public presence is brightened now, so put yourself out there and use this to your advantage.","There’s a great wide world waiting beyond your own backyard, and it starts calling to you when your ruling planet, Venus, moves into your travel and adventure zone today. Even if you prefer to stick close to home, you’ll become more interested in expanding your horizons and discovering fresh new vistas, some that can bring tantalizing and exotic experiences your way. Sometimes all it takes is an engrossing book or movie to transport you to a faraway place.","There’s an intense mood to the day, which means you'll be right in your element. Pleasure-loving Venus slips into your intimacy sector, changing the cosmic tone from light-hearted to serious and bringing you closer to your deepest desires. Focus on the things you truly want now; make a list if that helps get them in order. Then, start your plan of attack, strategizing how you’re going to obtain each and every thing on that list. Turn up the tenacity and know that you deserve it all.","There’s a magnetic energy in the air today, helping you see the light at the end of the tunnel. This light doesn’t arrive by itself, however, it comes to you with the aid of someone else. The universe is encouraging you to acknowledge your weaknesses now, and find someone who can complement them. When you combine your strengths and fill in each other's shortcomings, you both become stronger and more capable as you try to conquer your goals.","You have an urge to strike while the iron is hot, and with Venus entering your wellness sector this evening, it’s the perfect time to initiate some changes that will make you feel better overall. Identify what would be the best version of yourself, and start treating your body like a temple, making decisions that are in support of this vision. Be selective in the food and exercise you choose -- although it must be healthy, it must also be something you enjoy.","You’re getting into a creative frame of mind, and it’s a good day to put a personal spin on whatever you are working on, making sure everyone knows who is responsible, and just how capable you are. Add a few bells and whistles to whatever you’re doing, making things more exciting and enjoyable just for the fun of it. You don't have to worry about what others will think, because the universe is supporting your personal expression now.","You’ll probably want to spend some extra time in bed this morning, and that’s perfectly alright, so give yourself permission to hit the snooze button then make an easy day of it. Make a point not to rush through anything; instead, turn each and every step into its own little ritual. Find space within your home to feel renewed, working from the inside out, and soon enough, the world beyond your front door will feel renewed as well."
2021-05-09,"Emotional power-plays come front and center when the sensitive Moon forms a difficult square with controlling Pluto midday. We must watch our words, but these matters become easier in the evening when the Moon locks into a supportive sextile with lucky Jupiter, encouraging some light-hearted laughter. Our tempers will ease when the Moon moves into slow and steady Taurus at 7:46 pm EST, encouraging us to have a luxurious evening of good food and a good night’s rest.","The planets are creating a little bit of drama across your career sector today, so it is important to remember that life isn’t a race and you don’t need to win at all costs. A VIP or boss could push your buttons, and your first instinct might not be the most professional one, so count to ten and take a few deep breaths if you find yourself feeling a little thin-skinned. Things will calm down in the evening, so make a point to nurture yourself.","You may spend much of the day just trying to make sense of what's going on around you; it feels like you’re having to read between the lines or translate an unknown foreign language. Instead of stressing or trying to make sense of it all, just let it simmer on the backburner for now and return to it when you have a clearer view of the picture in front of you. Clarity will arrive eventually, just not today.","You're in an overall social mood now, but you may experience an overwhelming urge today to take cover and be by yourself for a bit. If people won’t stop hitting you up, then feel free to turn off your phone and shut the curtains. It takes a lot of energy to be a Gemini, and every once in a while, your body tells you that you need to pull back. Listen to it; once you get a little solitude, you'll be back to your usual self.","You’ve got every reason to aim high today as the Moon moves through your career sector, giving your ambitions a shot of adrenaline. However, a tough beam from Pluto in your relationship sector could create a bit of stress with a co-worker or business partner, so try to make room at the table for everyone, whether you’re in the mood to or not. Tempers will ease in the evening, so treat yourself to a nice dinner and a quiet night on the couch.","This is a beautiful time for you to get out into the world and explore as much as you can. However, while you are seeking new horizons, a difficult connection between the Moon and Pluto might remind you of the responsibilities waiting for you, pulling you back to your desk when you’d rather be off doing something more interesting. Make a point to clear your most important obligations out of the way early so that nothing can stop you from a day of discovery.","There may be some struggles ahead for you today when it comes to interacting with others. You could find yourself dragged into a dramatic situation that leaves you needing to pick a side. No matter what you choose, everyone's passions are heated now, so try to maintain your consummate cool and simply excuse yourself from any situations that don’t benefit you. Things will ease up by night time, when you can take it easy and unwind however you please.","While you normally do your best to deal with everyone calmly and fairly, you can expect to be a bit more sensitive than usual today. It's like your buttons are exposed for others to push freely, leaving you wondering what or who will set you off next. Put up any barriers that you need to today and give space and empathy to others and to yourself. You can let people back in tomorrow under gentler skies.","There's an extra level of perfection and efficiency in what you do today and you’ll be able to push through your chores if you focus. However, focusing might not be the easiest thing to do when power-hungry Pluto sends out a jealous beam to the emotional Moon, throwing an emotional wrench in the works. Whether this jealousy is directed toward you or it's coming from you, people will be a distraction today, so do your best to stay organized.","The good news is that you're in an expressive and artistic mindset today. The bad news is, a tough angle between the Moon and Pluto will require you to roll up your sleeves and put your nose to the grindstone when it comes to a financial situation, even though you’d rather be doing something more fun. This is only temporary, however, so get this money matter solved and know that, right after, you can return to an activity that makes your heart happy.","The comfort of your bed will be hard to escape today, and you should give yourself permission to hit the snooze button. Take things easy and let yourself move one step at a time, rather than trying to plan out every single step of your day in advance. Everything will feel more easygoing if you aren't trying to stick to a strict schedule. A burst of energy comes in the evening, so the urge to work might hit late; at least you'll be well rested for it.","Your brain is buzzing today and your schedule appears to be full of one thing after another. Keeping all your appointments in order might be rather difficult, however, as a shadow is cast over your mind, making it difficult to cut through the fat and get to the facts. What seemed so clear yesterday is fogged over today, and you may be feeling a bit spaced out. Try to keep your eye on the prize, even if your vision gets cloudy.","You can make a lot of progress if you focus on work and money matters today, but maintaining that focus may be the difficult part. There's disruptive energy in the air and your friends might come clamoring for your attention just when you need to roll up your sleeves and get something done. Instead of pushing back, give yourself permission to address their needs or say a few words, then return to your tasks at hand. Every time your focus gets pulled away, just bring it back to center."
2021-05-10,"We can enjoy a lowkey day today, though the excitement may pick up later on when the Moon receives a supportive beam from energizer Mars, putting some extra pep in our step. Once the Moon aligns with rebellious Uranus shortly after, we'll have the urge to go against the grain as we are encouraged to break free from our usual comfort zones. However, the Moon then squares off with Saturn, reminding us to get organized and get our lives in order before tomorrow starts.","You could stumble upon a positive message or experience regarding your finances today. It’s a good time to do some browsing or window shopping -- you may find a product or item that is truly a life-changer, and it could seem to appear out of nowhere. This is also a great time to seek out a new money-making opportunity, so if you’re hoping to increase your income, then start looking at job listings and see if you can’t find something that calls to you.","This can be a liberating moment for you. The Moon and Uranus are meeting up in your sign, giving you a deep need to break out of any confining boundaries or expectations people might be laying at your feet. Even if you normally prefer to follow the tried-and-true, a bit of rebellion and surprise will do wonders for your inner satisfaction right now. You are the one who gets to decide what is best for you, and you're ready to embrace this.","There's a buzz in your subconscious today and it might feel as though there are voices inside your head. Instead of trying to make sense of what is happening, lean into these flowing vibes and let yourself spend the day hanging out in the slow lane, sitting with the emotions and ideas that are bubbling up from unseen territory. Let them wander in your mind; if you can divine any of these mystical messages, you could uncover something truly magical.","You have a great urge today to not only connect with some of your favorite people, but to step outside the bounds of your usual social circle. There's comfort in long-term connections, but there's something exciting about a brand-new friendship. It's likely you'll meet a few new acquaintances, or even a whole group of people who may one day end up feeling like family. It's healthy to have social boundaries, but today, you'll be happiest if you reach beyond them.","A shockwave is sent through your career sector today, and you might need to spend a few extra hours burning the midnight oil. Instead of begrudging this, look at it as an opportunity to prove just how valuable you are to those who are keeping an eye on you. It's not just about getting the job done, it's about demonstrating how well you can do it. A little originality will carry you far, so go on and think outside the box.","You’re going to want to step out of your comfort zone today, and this process doesn't have to be uncomfortable. Look beyond your usual experiences and what you tend to do on the daily -- where is there some room for bending the rules? If you follow the same patterns of routine day in and day out, then nothing will ever change, and change is encouraged now. Take your cues from far off places and people from other cultures; something different than what you know would be best.","There’s a spark of inspiration traveling throughout the skies today, and you might feel as though it is resonating deep within you, on a level that other people don’t get to see very often. Take time away from everyone and do some soul searching; are there some behaviors you could stand to let go of? Think about the phoenix rising from the ashes, stronger and wiser than before, then make a point to show others just how much you can change from the inside out.","A surprise might come your way today, and it looks like it is going to come from a very specific person in your life -- someone with whom you stand on equal footing. This person could be a friend, a co-worker, or even a lover, but they are going to go against the grain of your expectations. There’s nothing wrong with that, and the surprise could, in fact, be one you enjoy immensely, but it’s still best to be prepared in these situations. Expect the unexpected.","Work might seem a little ho-hum today, even if your job is normally fun and exciting, so don’t be shocked if you feel the urge to throw a wrench in the works just for the heck of it. You can change things up without throwing everyone else off course, but it might be best to take this day on your own and create a path to follow without others trailing after you. Make your own roads today, and let people follow tomorrow.","There’s a beautiful vibration moving through the air today, and it is giving you permission to do as you please, leaving your work and other obligations waiting for you to return to them under less indulgent skies. In the meantime, take some extra time getting dressed, putting on some of your favorite clothes, then go on and do something expressive -- write, draw, sing, paint -- and let that spark become something tangible. Your spirit will be happy and others will be impressed by your talents.","You’re going to be conscious of some frenetic energy today, energy that appears to be directed right under your own roof. Rebellious Uranus is acting up in your home and family sector, so be on the lookout for bruised egos and flaring tempers around the house. A roommate or family member might overstep their boundaries, so if you need your space, then go ahead and claim it; you can come to terms tomorrow under easier skies.","People seem to be clamoring for your attention today, even if you would rather just take things easy and at your own pace. Still, make a point to respond to texts and answer any calls, because something really interesting could grab your attention when you least expect it. A friend or sibling might have something very important to tell you, and though it may not seem all that important at first, it could wind up having a long-term impact on your life; you’ll want to hear this."
2021-05-11,"The powerful New Moon in Taurus energizes the skies today right at 3:00 pm EST, reminding us of our own inner abilities and just how much we can achieve when we set our minds to it and put in the effort. The mood takes a dreamy turn, however, when the Moon forms a lovely sextile with mystical Neptune, helping us see the world as though it were a watercolor painting. But when action-planet Mars connects with shocking Uranus in the evening, we may be in for a surprise.","The universe is ready to make it rain, in a way you'll enjoy. The New Moon activates your money sector today, and opens up a 2-week window for you to implement new efforts and structures that can increase your financial flow. Whether you’re angling for a raise or a promotion or a new job altogether, now is the time to start putting in the effort. You could be in a whole different tax bracket by the time the Full Moon happens in this same part of your chart later this year.","You get a personal fresh start today as the New Moon occurs in your sign, encouraging you to put yourself and your desires front and center. Whatever it is that creates a fire within you, focus on it and put all your energy into making it manifest. An extra layer of support from Neptune will add a fantastical touch to the day, so go ahead and make a wish. You just might see your dream come true.","There’s an odd mix of energies impacting you as the New Moon falls in your subconscious sector, making this a time of both beginnings and endings. New Moons want you to start something new, but this realm of your chart is all about letting go. To make use of this energy, start identifying aspects of your life that no longer serve you, be they toxic patterns of behavior or emotional crutches you need to stop relying on. You’ll thank yourself down the road for making an effort.","There’s an altruistic mood to the day, making this a wonderful time to see if you can do something for someone else. It could be as simple as lending a helping hand with the chores around the house, or something more ambitious, like rounding up a group of people to go spend a few hours volunteering in your community. Look around your house and see if there isn’t anything you can donate or put toward a good cause.","There's powerful rocket fuel in your engines today, blessing you with the push you need to reach those heights you’ve always dreamed of. It’s a great time to make a list of professional priorities and establish what needs to be done to help ease your ascent to the top. It'll take more than one big leap, but creating a strategic game plan will make achieving your ambitions that much easier. Go step by step, but go for the gold.","There’s a wind blowing your way from a distant land, and it’s tinged with exotic spices and flavors that make your mouth water. Instead of following your same routine, take this opportunity to add some extra zest to your life, whether that’s with the food you eat, the clothes you wear, the books you read, or the music you listen to. You can find amazing life lessons in cultures different from your own, if you only take the time to look.","There’s an intense energy building within you, and it might leave you feeling the need to unburden yourself to someone else. Whether you have a secret you want to share or simply need a good listener with an open mind, take time to connect with people and open up. You don’t need to throw every emotion at them, but letting people in right now is a very good idea; it will help your psyche to clear the decks of anything holding you down.","It’s fine to do things on your own most of the time, but every once in a while, even you can benefit from getting help from a partner, be they platonic, professional, romantic, or otherwise. If you’re worried about there being room enough for both of you at the finish line or at the top of the mountain, don’t, because there is indeed space enough for everyone to exist, and you’ll get there much faster if you have someone helping you along the way.","You are blessed with a fresh injection of energy today, so use this to your advantage. If you can, get your day started before others are even waking up, and see how much you accomplish before lunchtime. Once you see the progress you've made, you'll only be inspired to keep going. After you check off all the boxes before you, treat yourself to a fun evening, even if that’s just hanging out on the couch. You deserve relaxation as your reward.","There’s an exciting energy to the day, one that is encouraging you to put yourself front and center with a focus on all the things that make you unique. If you have ever wanted to make a name for yourself as a creative, this is a great time to start taking the necessary steps to show people just how artistic you can be. Start setting aside time every day to dedicate to your craft, and eventually it may not be just a hobby, but a lifestyle.","An update to your home's energy may be long overdue. If circumstances and feelings from the past year are lingering and stifling your space, it’s a good day to start browsing online for some inspiration to freshen things up. Perhaps a new coat of paint is all you need, or maybe you want to scrap everything and start with a totally blank slate. Either way, start thinking about how you'd create your ideal environment, putting a premium on comfort. Brightening your space has a way of brightening your mood.","There’s a focus on the way you communicate and get your ideas across right now; are you direct, or are you rather wishy-washy, taking long detours to reach your point? It’s fine to take your time, but not if that means taking forever. Try to express yourself in more concrete ways now, showing people what you want and need rather than expecting them to read your mind. You’ll find people are eager to help you when they actually know what it is that you want."
2021-05-12,"There’s a flurry of energy early this morning as the intuitive Moon spins through the last few degrees of stubborn Taurus, and while she’s there she will square off against Jupiter, creating a bit of a bang when we’re least expecting it. It will be easier to get in gear once the Moon shifts into Gemini at 8:43 am EST, acting like a cosmic caffeine boost. The day can take a productive turn in the afternoon as messenger Mercury aligns with karmic Saturn, so it’s a great day to make long-lasting plans.","People will be bringing lots of interesting information your way today, and you’d be wise to listen up, because this information has the ability to impact you for a long time to come. While you’re so busy focusing on your own plans, make a point to touch base with the people in your life, especially the wider net of acquaintances that you’ve built up over the years. Someone will tell you something that is worth its weight in gold, so be open to discovery.","A path is opening up in front of you today, and that path may lead you to the very top of the professional ladder. You don’t have to make the entire climb all at once, but this is the perfect time to start planning your ascent, taking stock of all the things you’ll need in order to reach that lofty place you want to be. A VIP or boss might offer a helping hand, and you’d be wise to accept it.","You get an extra burst of energy this morning, so don’t be shocked if your morning coffee seems to pack a little more punch than usual. Use this gift of forward momentum to look beyond your usual reality and search out new vistas -- ones that have the ability to inspire new ideas that really light a fire inside of you. There is something special waiting for you just beyond the horizon, so get ready to seek it out.","Things could feel a little heavy today in a way that makes you feel like you’re missing something obvious, or like you have to mentally translate every word coming out of other people’s mouths, even if you’re speaking the same language. While it might not be easy trying to wade through these odd energies, you can get to the bottom of the issue by taking your hands off the steering wheel and letting life take over. It knows where it’s taking you.","There’s a sociable energy in the air for you today, but it isn’t so much about light-hearted hangouts or quick chats. Rather, you should get down to the nitty-gritty with people in your life, digging into the subjects you might have been a little hesitant to approach on more casual terms. It doesn’t have to be serious, but you can make major headway on a complicated topic right now -- especially one that would normally give you a major headache.","Today is all about finding balance, both within and without yourself. Look around your life and ask yourself where you have been giving more than getting. Or, perhaps it’s the other way around. If the scales of your life seem to be wildly out of sync, then it’s time to start getting on equal footing again. You don’t have to jump from one extreme to another, or change overnight, rather, take small steps to get to a place that’s more in-sync with the world.","There’s a creative vibration coming your way, encouraging you to unleash your inner artist. If you don’t think of yourself as artistic, think of it as unleashing your inner child and giving it free rein to do as it pleases for the day. Instead of holding yourself up to high expectations, you can be a little bit messy, a little bit wild, and a little bit loud, just for the fun of it. You shouldn’t cause a scene, but you should assert your individuality.","It’s a good day to be productive and get your act together. Whether you’ve got all your ducks in a row or you’re scrambling to keep up appearances, take a minute this morning and center yourself before engaging with the world. Think about ways in which you can work smarter, not harder, and get the results you need to feel like you’re on top of as many aspects of your life as possible. Find the loose threads today, then start weaving them together.","You'll want to speak your feelings today, but you can't expect to just throw everything at the wall and see what sticks -- you'll need to communicate with real thought and intent. There’s a strong planetary alignment happening across your communication sectors, and while it is positive, it’s not exactly light-hearted. Make a point to empathize with everyone you come into contact with; something that seems like banter to you could easily push the buttons of someone else, and you don’t want to offend anyone.","There's a lot coming your way today, and while you’ll be able to handle it all with a calm and collected approach, you might find life feels a bit like a game of Whack-a-Mole in the process. Lots of little disturbances will be happening -- lots of little things that are fine when they come one at a time, but that become overwhelming when you have to deal with them all. Take a deep breath and do your best to keep a cool head.","Even if you’ve got a million things on your to-do list, it looks as though you won’t be terribly interested in checking off any of them -- not when there are a million more exciting things for you to focus on. The planets are giving you the day off from your responsibilities to pursue more pleasurable things, so go ahead and put your desires front and center. If people keep asking things of you, tell them you’ll get back to them tomorrow; today should be all about you.","There is an emphasis on solace and quiet for you today. You are getting ready to enter a major period of change and manifestation very soon, but it isn’t here just yet, and before it arrives, it would be best to make a point to detox some negativity in your life. Look around and ask yourself what no longer serves you. If there are behaviors or relationships you have outgrown, then start weeding them out of your life, making room for the new."
2021-05-13,"There's a dose of inspired energy to the day as the vibrant Sun forms a supportive angle with mystical Neptune in the early hours. We’re going to be looking beyond the veil, and feeling things especially deeply when the sensitive Moon aligns with communicator Mercury in the early afternoon. Bountiful Jupiter takes the focus in the evening, however, diving into Pisces at 6:36 pm EST, starting off a long trend of magical thinking for us all. Barriers can be broken down today, reminding us that change is possible.","You’ve got a lot to say today, so go ahead and get on your soapbox and let people hear your message. If you’ve been sitting on a project for a while, waiting for the perfect moment to unveil it, you couldn’t ask for a better time to make your pitch. No need to fear you won’t be well received; the planets are sending a guardian angel to help you out, so there will be support waiting, whether you need it or not.","It’s a good time to deal with mundane matters, but while this might sound rather unexciting, there’s a special spark to the day that will make these things seem anything but mundane when you actually roll up your sleeves and get to work. Look at old problems with a fresh eye and be willing to start from scratch if that's what the situation requires. If you need help, don’t be shy about asking; people will be very supportive right now, so don’t overload yourself unnecessarily.","No one can hold you back right now as the universe is supporting you in just about any and every endeavor you might embark upon. You’re especially favored when it comes to professional matters, so take this fabulous force of energy and let it propel you along to whatever heights you might be eyeing. A superior or VIP could even emerge to give you a leg up, and you’ll be very happy for the extra boost and the rewards it brings.","The universe is sending a beam of positive energy your way, clearing roadblocks and opening up new avenues for you to explore. Exploration is key right now, so dive into the unknown with abandon, leaving behind what you know and letting yourself experience the most unusual and exotic sides of life. It’s also a great day to pick up a new spiritual practice for your mental health, like meditation, so try to find something that will calm you and also open your mind.","There’s a crackle in the air and a special spark, but you may find that it's happening off in the wings where you can’t see it -- or perhaps you feel it deep down in the pit of your stomach, but you can’t seem to figure out why. Lean into these mystical vibrations, because they are doing some major work behind the scenes, like a seed sprouting beneath the earth’s surface. Something powerful is getting ready to sprout, something you’ve been growing, so give it some attention.","Although you’re generally happy to handle your responsibilities all by yourself, every once in a while, even you can benefit from someone else lending a helping hand. Instead of pushing people away and telling them you’re fine, let people enter your life today, and don’t put any expectations on them, because the less you expect the more you’ll be surprised. Don’t worry that it’ll be a bad surprise -- you’re sure to enjoy this one, so meet it with an open heart.","You can feel an energy bubbling today, but it could be a little difficult to tell whether it’s coming from within you or coming at you from an exterior source. You have a lot of power to wield right now -- even if you normally prefer to leave things for others to handle -- so instead of sitting idly by and waiting on someone else to act, summon all that courage and show people what you’re all about.","There’s an undeniably positive beam of energy coming your way today, putting your desires at the very top of your priority list. Go ahead and express yourself in your preferred medium, whatever that might be -- music, poetry, drawing -- and turn your regular day into something special. If you’re someone with an artistic inclination, then this could be a really favorable day for you to put your work on display. No matter what you engage in, let your creative force grow.","The morning starts off with a soft energy to it, and this will carry through the entire day. While you won’t feel pushed to accomplish a lot or go and conquer the world, you can make major strides just by puttering around your house and thinking about what you’d like to change in front of you. Perhaps it’s time to do a little redecorating, or it might even be time to look for a whole new place to live. A change is coming close to home.","There’s a taste of freedom coming your way, which is probably going to be very welcome after the rather cooped-up life you’ve been living for some time. Things won’t change overnight, but you’re going to notice more and more people calling your name to come play, and with those voices, you’ll notice life is starting to pick up. It’s a good time to get some sort of calendar going, because things are happening, even if they're still in the planning phases.","It’s a good day to get down to basics, and the planets will be helping you along in this mission, especially regarding your finances. Today marks the start of a long-term opportunity to increase your financial standing, so try and identify what changes you’d like to make, whether it’s a small raise or a whole new position. It will take time, but you have the support now, so start working your way toward that goal, however lofty it might be.","Life has probably been a little foggy for a while, like you were operating far off in outer space, but today, the universe is encouraging you to come back to earth and start making sense of the matters in front of you again. Bountiful Jupiter is entering your sign, bringing a wave of positivity and opportunity to you. This is a wonderful time to make a game plan for what you’d like to accomplish with this luck on your side."
2021-05-14,"Getting out of bed might be more difficult than normal as the Moon forms a foggy square to imaginative Neptune at 6:51 am EDT, making our dreams that much more vivid but our alarms that much louder. While we may need an extra cup of coffee to get in the groove of things, the evening promises better times, as the Moon will shift into deep-feeling Cancer and then reach out to lucky Jupiter, giving us all a late dose of undeniable positivity.","The day starts out on a breezy note, and you’ll be more than happy to fly wherever the wind might take you. Connect with people in ways that are fulfilling, making the best of the opportunities available to you. If you’ve fallen out of touch with a sibling or close friend, pick up the phone and try to get back on the same page. The night will wind down on a quieter note, so nest and treat yourself to some rest and relaxation.","There’s an efficient tone to the day, helping you plow through the tasks in front of you. You can accomplish a lot right now without becoming an absolute workhorse, so take plenty of breaks throughout the day to keep your mind fresh and clear. You'll be able to leave work behind by the time the Moon rises in the sky, so clear your head and call up a friend to change the energy around you.","There's fresh wind in your sails today, so let yourself go as far as you possibly can, even if only in a metaphorical sense. Take some time to make sure you have all the equipment you need, then start out on your personal journey, searching out something that will bring some joy into your life. Make the most of this energy while you can, because tonight, the Moon will move into your money sector, and your focus will switch to work.","There’s a mystical energy to the day, almost as though you were looking at the world through a kaleidoscope. You can take things easy, moving at your own pace, and get back to people when it suits you. It’s best to take this time to conserve your energy, because late in the evening, there will be a shift that fills you with a shot of adrenaline. Use it to conquer the world tomorrow, but just relax and enjoy today.","You’ll benefit from networking today and pooling your resources together with others, so if you can’t meet up with people in person, at least make an effort to reach out with the aid of technology. There's power in sharing and working together now. The energy will calm down in the evening, and you’ll benefit from a quiet night at home. Spending some time by yourself dreaming or just relaxing will be a welcome relief after a day interacting.","This can be a productive day and you’re in your element when it comes to professional matters, so set as many goals for yourself as possible, because you can attain them more easily than usual. That being said, make those goals realistic rather than radical, and you’ll achieve them without having to break a sweat. Go hard during the day, then ease off at night and enjoy yourself with your friends -- play a game on your phone or watch a movie together, even if you’re in different places.","There’s an adventurous mood to the day, so even if you can’t travel very far right now, make a point to find ways to expand your world in one way or another. It’s a perfect time to dive into a new book, start learning a new language, or take an online course. Indulge in some learning just for the mental reward, then turn around and use all these new lessons to help you reach a new goal or milestone.","Life might feel a little intense today, so feel free to keep your cards close to your chest rather than laying it all out there for everyone else to see. You don’t have to be anti-social, but if you’re not feeling like checking in with others, then there is nothing wrong with keeping to yourself for the time being. The mood will change in the evening and you’ll be more willing to share what’s on your mind as the hours pass.","Your attention is focused toward the significant people in your life today, be they platonic, professional, or romantic, so it’s a good time to touch base with the people you’d like to think of as your plus-ones. If you can find a way to safely socialize, then this is a wonderful time to do so, but don’t be shocked if you prefer to tone things down in the evening. Once the Moon enters a quieter part of your chart, you’ll be happier to put up some walls.","You’re ready to start off the day on a productive note, thanks to the Moon spinning through your work and wellness sector. Make a point to eat healthy and get in a little physical activity. You can make major headway on the job, too, so roll up your sleeves and show your co-workers how things should be done. After a day of hard work, by the evening, you'll benefit from some quality time at home with someone who's special to you.","The day arrives with a dose of positivity and fun, so even if you have a dull to-do list in front of you, there’s a good chance you can find ways to spice things up. Make a point to indulge yourself in things, especially if you tend to hold back a bit when it comes to smelling the roses. The evening will send you a more efficient vibration, so focus on some nurturing self-care like a long soak in a bubble bath.","There's an extra layer of sensitivity in the air -- not necessarily in a bad one, rather the kind that will leave you feeling like hitting the snooze button and taking the morning one easy step at a time. Other people can rush about here and there, but just continue to move at your own pace and don’t let anyone tell you to do otherwise. The evening could send a last-minute opportunity your way, so you'll conserve your energy for when you'll need it most."
2021-05-15,"There’s a push-pull vibration to the day and we may find ourselves scratching our heads this morning, wondering where exactly we’re supposed to dedicate our energies. Action planet Mars is forming an awkward angle with hard-working Saturn, making us feel like a car that keeps stalling though the key is in the ignition. The energy picks up in the evening, and even becomes inspiring, when the Moon sextiles innovative Uranus at 8:35 pm EDT, bringing on a late brainstorming session. Brilliant ideas are ready to strike.","There’s a focus on the feminine people in your life today, especially on women who might have either raised you or who inspire and impress you now. When was the last time you reached out to one to ask for some advice? Make a point to connect with a woman you really respect and ask for her two cents on a matter close to your heart; she could have some words of wisdom that put things in a very clear perspective for you.","The planets are encouraging you to act out today. This doesn’t mean you have to be dramatic or make a scene, rather that you should take any opportunities to do things a little bit differently and with a little more self-expression. A creative approach is favored right now, and if you think outside the box, you could come up with some truly inspired ideas or solutions that can help both you and others. Two heads are better than one, so talk things through with a friend.","If it feels like you’re hearing voices in your head, you don’t need to worry -- in fact, you should try to listen. Lean into this otherworldly vibration that is coming your way and see if you can’t gather anything useful from it. It looks as though an idea could wing its way to you from beyond the veil, and while you might not know how or why you were able to think it up, you’ll be grateful when it translates to success down the road.","Today might seem a little strange, and that strangeness will specifically be coming from the people in your life. You don’t need to worry that this strangeness is a bad thing, however; rather, embrace it, and see if the oddities that appear before you can be translated into something more useful. If someone proposes something that seems a little off track, don’t automatically say no, but sit with it a while, carefully examining the issue from all sides. There’s a silver lining somewhere.","It’s a wonderful day to make major strides at work, and you won’t have to make too much of an effort to see a fabulous reward. The planets are giving you a huge boost of energy, and you can use it to make a name for yourself out in the world where people will be very impressed by you. A guardian angel is looking out for you today, so make a wish and see where it takes you.","There’s something in the air today that is inspiring you to step out of your usual lane and see what life is like beyond what you know. You don’t have to dive into this search alone; in fact, you will get a lot more out of this endeavor if you try something new in tandem with a group of friends. If you can’t get together and be face-to-face, think about starting an online book club or taking an interesting class together. There are still ways to expand your world.","Today is a good day to examine your energy reserves and the support systems you keep in place to keep pushing yourself along. Do you have all the support you need? There are people and resources available to you, even if you don’t see them right away -- you just have to take the time to look for them. Look at the world differently today and you’ll see things you never imagined possible, much to your benefit.","You don’t have to stick to your guns like usual today, but that doesn’t mean you have to be a doormat, either. The best approach right now is to keep an open mind, because the universe wants you to be flexible and give other people a chance to prove themselves, even if you normally prefer to do things on your own. Open up and let others in; they will be more of a support than you could have imagined.","There's a lot of potential for you but you'll need to start acting like your own personal cheer squad. While focusing on self-improvement isn’t always the most exciting thing to do, you’ll benefit from taking stock of yourself today, and that includes acknowledging both the good and the bad. If you’ve been dropping the ball either at work or with your wellness, then it’s time to pick it back up and join the game once again; there’s no more sitting on the sidelines for you.","It seems that things have gotten skewed in your relationships with some important people, or at least you’ve wound up on different pages without even meaning to. Instead of letting this fly under the radar, make a point to salvage those ties before they come undone. Whether it's a coworker, friend, family member, or romantic partner, reach out and see if you can’t make things the way the used to be, if not a whole lot better.","It’s a good day to look around your house and identify any little things that need fixing. If you’ve been putting off calling a professional to come and deal with some faulty plumbing or leaky faucets, now is the perfect time to get that handled. It might not be the most exciting action plan, but it will bring you a great peace of mind to have one less thing to worry about. Take these burdens off your shoulders.","It’s a good day for an escape, but that doesn’t mean packing your trunk and hitting the road. Rather, try to do some mental escapism, preferably with an old book that takes you places, just like it did when you were a child. It’s important to take time to nurture your spirit as well as your inner child now, and there’s nothing like a wonderful story to make you believe in the impossible. Will you go to Oz or Wonderland?"
2021-05-16,"Today it feels like we are trying to find our footing on shifting shores as the tides wash in and wash out, tossing us around like grains of sand. The Moon aligns with restless Mars in the early hours, so our dreams might be more vivid than usual, if we can actually manage to fall and stay asleep in the first place. The mood will calm down throughout the day, and when the Moon forms an easy angle to dreamy Neptune at 6:42 pm EST, a gentler vibe washes over us.","Something is coming up from deep under the surface, and it is going to be pushing you along at a breakneck pace, but it may not be pushing you all that far; in fact, you’re probably going to be spinning in circles within your own four walls. Powerful energies are coming to a boiling point on the home front, making it seem like there is hardly enough space for you wherever you might look; take time to yourself as necessary, or else tempers might flare.","Your tongue is sharper than usual today, so you may want to watch your words. You don’t have to keep quiet or avoid people; if anything, you should make a point to reach out to people and touch base, because conversations could be almost electric right now. Just make sure you don’t send out so much electricity that it winds up shocking the other person; there’s a big difference between sharing your ideas and having a one-sided conversation.","The universe is lighting a fire in your engine, but the gas gauge is going to read in terms of finances rather than mileage. There is a powerful energy focused in your money sector today, one that could help you make it rain on a whole new level. If you’re looking for a fresh opportunity to increase your earnings, now is the perfect time to start searching for something that will be the perfect fit for you -- a raise, or even a whole new job, could be yours.","You are receiving a lucky and powerful push from the universe today that could help you make major strides in whatever you are working on or dreaming of. Your energy reserves are especially amplified right now because they are aligned with your emotions. This is no day to simply rest or to loiter about. You can move mountains if you try, so put forth all your energy and don’t set any limits on yourself. Believe that you can, and you will.","There's a mystical feel to the day, almost like there is a major event occurring just off the periphery of your vision, just beyond where you can see it. This isn't an immediate message that you are missing, though -- this energy is part of a preparatory phase. The best thing that you can do is take a step back and go wherever the universe wants you to; you’ll be able to travel further if you don’t push against your purpose.","People have a lot to say today, for better or for worse. It’s all well and good if you’re in a social mood, but if you don’t want to hear any guff from the peanut gallery, then you might want to put on some headphones and take a step back from communication. There’s a tense vibration in your social sector, but it’s only temporary, so you can get back to people in a day or two -- for now, it might be best to fly solo.","The stars are encouraging you to aim high today, and the wonderful thing is that you won’t need to expend a lot of effort in order to make a lot of progress. The road in front of you is clearing up and you have an extra bounce in your step, so use these advantages while you have them and propel yourself forward to where you want to be. A VIP or boss could help you along this path to success; accept any helping hands along the way!","A fresh breeze is coming your way, and with it, you are encouraged to open yourself up to new ideas and to new ways of approaching life. It’s easy to get stuck in a rut, especially when life feels confining, but some unexpected opportunities are coming that will help you break beyond the confining barriers you’ve been living with for some time. You shouldn’t sit back and wait for them to appear, though -- search out these opportunities the best you can.","Life might feel like something of a tightrope walk today, but there isn’t any reason you can’t manage it. There’s a powerful energy bubbling up, and it’s going to be impacting you on a very deep level, one that can make things appear more dramatic and intense than they actually are. Do your best to keep your calm if a conflicting situation comes your way. Maintaining balance is the only way to make it across the rope.","You're on the receiving end of some strong energy today, and it is coming directly from someone who you probably think of as an equal or a partner, be it a lover, friend, or co-worker. Whether this energy will be used for good or for ill is still to be seen, though. You could wind up getting your buttons pushed when you’d prefer just to keep things copacetic, or someone could unexpectedly bring some very tempting and exciting times your way. Either way, be aware of your reaction.","You’re going to have a lot of excess energy today, so it isn’t your imagination if you wake up with the urge to let loose in one way or another. Get in a good workout if you can, one that really gets your blood pumping. Use whatever energy is left over to do some organizing, whether that’s just doing the laundry or getting your whole life in tip-top shape. If you spend this day cleaning up your act, you’ll be glad you did.","You’re going to have a particularly fun day, or at least the offer is on the table, as long as you don’t hide yourself away and refuse this wonderful opportunity. The universe is encouraging you to express yourself in the most sincere and passionate ways, being truly yourself without fear or any sense of trepidation. Whether you want to literally put on a show or just spend time dancing or doodling in your room, make a point to be creative."
2021-05-17,"The day gets off to a gentle start as the sensitive Moon forms an easy-going alignment with the Sun, encouraging us to lay low and conserve our energy. But things will pick up when the Sun forms a powerful and rare trine to alchemical Pluto, helping us to cut through the fat and get to the heart of the matter that is concerning us, beyond its concealing layers. The Moon will move into courageous Leo at 8:44 am, so it’s a wonderful time for us to assert ourselves.","There is a powerful spark of energy coming at you today that is pushing you to heights you’ve only dreamed of, especially with regards to your work and career. This energy is extremely potent and it is also very positive, so use it to send yourself hurtling forward toward the finish line. You can make major progress right now, just don’t trample anyone on your way to the end. The more people that will celebrate your success, the better.","You are the lucky winner of the universe's lottery today. There is a very potent energy in the atmosphere, but it is also harmonious, and something worth grabbing hold of. Fortunately, out of all the signs, you will benefit more than most from this energy, so go ahead and take control of any situations that present themselves to you today. If you’ve been waiting on the sidelines to make a name for yourself in one way or another, this is the perfect day to strike.","Something exceptionally powerful is pulsating through the skies today, but it’s happening in ways that might feel a bit mysterious and vaporous to you. Instead of trying to seize the day, sit back and see if you can’t divine some special message being directed to you from out in the great wide yonder. You might not even need to be very active to do this, since it looks like a guardian angel will be coming out of the shadows to assist you in some way.","You might find yourself buffeted about today, like a ship on a choppy sea, although the waves are coming from other people rather than the ocean. Lots of people are going to be trying to get your attention for one reason or another, and you need to step back and decide which of them are actually worth listening to. You’ll make more progress working one-on-one rather than bouncing around with a group, so pick a partner and see what two can accomplish.","There’s a highly professional energy to the day, but that doesn’t mean you have to be as buttoned-up as possible. Rather, the planets are encouraging you to ensure your foundations are as strong as they need to be for you to build and get to where you want to be -- which is probably quite a lofty position. Make sure your actions are lining up with your goals, but if they’re at odds, figure out a game plan to get back on track.","The planets are encouraging you to assert your individuality, and they are giving you all the energy and drive required to make this happen and stand out from the pack. Even if you don’t normally relish the idea of the spotlight, it’s a good idea to take it now, and remind people of all the things you’re capable of. Channel your inner inspiration and see if you can’t cook up something magical. If you do, it could impact your life for years to come.","It's like something within your very soul is shouting out for attention today, but this isn’t actually a bad thing. This is the perfect time to assert yourself and your needs, and if you find they aren’t being met, then it is time to do everything within your power to make sure they are. You tend to be a little go-with-the-flow, but today, you should be the only one calling the shots. Only you know what your soul truly needs.","There’s something electric in the air today, an energy that is going to take hold of you and make sure you take notice, and that’s hardly a bad thing. There is an exceptionally powerful opportunity just waiting for you, but it’s waiting in tandem with a partner, so it’s a terrific time to break through any barriers that stand between you and another specific person. Powerful bonds can manifest now if you put in the effort and intention.","Success may just seem to fall in your lap today thanks to a transformative vibration that is impacting your finances and work life. Get to work early and dedicate yourself to the tasks in front of you; even if your plate is empty, try to find a way to focus on manifesting material gains. Opportunities like this are rare and the planets are pushing you toward a pot of gold; do your best to find it quickly as possible.","Today you are given a chance to chase after your dreams and do as you please, so even if you’re rather buttoned-up as a rule, take this rare opportunity to manifest your deepest desires. They don’t have to be “deep” in an intense way, they really just need to bring you joy; if it doesn’t make you smile, then don’t worry about it today. Put your pleasure front and center and worry about returning to your responsibilities in a day or two.","Emotional currents are running strong today, and while Aquarians aren't known for their deep-feeling ways, even you have emotions that need to be tended to every once in a while. There is a strong vibration in the universe that is impacting your inner foundations on a profound level. Instead of turning tail and running away from this trend, do your best to embrace it and take this opportunity to do some inner excavation; you’ll be surprised by what you find.","The more you interact with others today, the more you'll discover. Although you should do your best to connect with people now, you don’t have to be face to face to get in quality time. That being said, this energy is quite pointed and could bring some very interesting and relevant information your way -- information that changes a lot of your current situation -- so keep an ear out, and if someone rings you unexpectedly, don’t let it go to voicemail. Things could change for you that quickly."
2021-05-18,"Today we might feel buffeted about by the planets, as the emotionally charged Moon in Leo will be forming a number of strong angles to other planets. Early in the morning she’ll form a tense square to rebellious Uranus, giving us a shock, only to oppose stern Saturn a few hours later, reminding us that there are responsibilities to tend to, regardless of any surprises. Communicative Mercury will sextile the Moon at 10:55 pm EDT, so there could be some very interesting late-night conversations.","This is a morning to take things slowly and not let yourself get carried away. Someone or something might throw a wrench in the works when you least expect it and confront you with a number of roadblocks when you’d rather have a clear road ahead of you. This won’t move your entire day off course, but to keep sure footing if something should go wrong, it’s a good idea to move forward one small step at a time today.","You are being pulled in a number of directions right now, making it more than a little difficult to figure out just what exactly you want to do. The energy for you today is low-key, so hitting the snooze button a few extra times is probably going to sound pretty appealing, but work is going to come calling for your attention whether you’re awake or not. This is a day to get up, put on the coffee, and meet the world head-on!","There’s a busy note to today’s energy, one that is going to pull you in several different ways, but out of all the signs you are the most well-equipped to handle this. Avoid burnout by focusing on one thing at a time, giving yourself the freedom to bounce around from task to task, doing little bits here and there. That will be the easiest way to chip away at these projects while still maintaining a calm and collected head.","Things start off with an efficient vibe this morning, but whether you’ll be able to keep that laser focus throughout the rest of the day remains to be seen. It looks as though, despite your best efforts, there are going to be a lot of little issues popping up here and there that you'd prefer to deal with later. Unfortunately, you’re going to need to tend to them now. Roll up your sleeves and get to work so you can reward yourself later!","You’d love nothing more than to follow your own passions and pursue them as far as you possibly can today. As wonderful as that might sound, it looks like there are going to be quite a few matters demanding your attention even when you’d rather attend to life on your own terms. In fact, an unexpected event at work may require you to reorient your focus at the last minute. If you handle it well, you could end up wowing a VIP in the process.","Today might feel like you’ve wandered into some unknown dreamland. While you prefer to keep solid ground beneath your feet, there is nothing wrong with letting yourself take a few steps off the beaten path and seeing what’s waiting for you beyond your usual territory. Changing your perspective on things can seem daunting at first, but it could be really good for you in the long run. Try opening your mind a bit; there’s lots waiting for you to discover.","A bit of confusion is in store for you today as you try to decide what to do, but that doesn’t automatically mean it’s going to be a difficult day. Rather, it looks like the offers in store for you are all going to be quite enticing. You’re going to have to make up your mind regarding which one you want to pursue, because unfortunately you can’t pursue them all. Don’t worry about FOMO -- you will enjoy whatever path you choose.","A road is opening up for you today, and it’s leading you to a lovely place of success and acclaim. However, just when you're beginning to pick up speed, a friend, co-worker, or even a romantic partner could pop up and demand your attention, throwing you off course. They may not leave you alone, so politely ask for some space to focus on the work at hand. You can return to them in a day or two when you’ve made more progress.","It’s lovely to set your sights far and wide, but before you can go chasing after your dreams, you’re going to have to tend to a few mundane matters in the here and now. Someone at work is going to need your help in one way or another today -- perhaps a client keeps taking up your time or a co-worker who needs you to save them from catastrophe. Instead of letting this get to you, take a breath and put your previous plans on ice for the day.","It could be a light and fluffy kind of day one minute, then anything but the next minute. Instead of letting yourself get tossed around like a ping-pong ball, try and become the calm at the center of the storm, emerging every once in a while to let the wind fill your sails and push you to somewhere more appealing. Don’t allow other people to tell you how you are supposed to handle these matters; today is all about you making your own choices.","It might be all but impossible to get a few quiet moments to yourself today. You’d think you could at least hide out at home and get some space, but there might be a bit of a blow-up under your own roof. This doesn’t have to be a big fight and could be something as simple as needing to tend to some chores you’ve been ignoring for a while. If you’ve waited to do spring cleaning, now’s the time to finally check it off your list.","This is a day to be open to possibilities and not be too set in your ways or too attached to your original plans. That's because something or someone is going to pop up when you least expect it and set you on a whole different course than the one you were expecting. Even though it could turn out to be a really fun opportunity, it might still be a bit jarring to change direction. Keep calm and carefully examine any offers before you make a decision."
2021-05-19,"Today is a day for all things in moderation. The inventive Leo Moon will square the pleasure-seeking Taurus Sun, reminding us to enjoy the good life, but also not to mindlessly consume without creating something in turn. When the Moon shifts into efficient Virgo this evening, it will be a good time for us to put our best foot forward. Once romantic Venus connects with practical Saturn at 9:58 pm EDT, love will flourish -- but only if we're grounded and realistic about it.","A positive vibration is bounding your way through the cosmos, and it looks as though it won’t be arriving all by itself. This beautiful beam is going to be directed at you from other people, most likely from a friend or a friend of a friend. Instead of hiding away, make a point to connect in whatever way you can today. Call someone up and make up for lost time between the two of you. Your efforts will be well rewarded.","The stars are pushing you up the cosmic career ladder today, and you’d do well to let them boost you. A job well done could be noticed by a boss or other VIP, and this will translate into a nice raise or a bonus for you, so don't rest on your laurels. Even if you’d rather take it easy, this progress won’t require you to break a sweat, and you'll easily wow others and yourself with how much you can achieve.","You’ve got cosmic permission to put your desires front and center today, and there isn’t anyone who can tell you otherwise. Think about what brings you the most fulfillment in the world, what makes your heart sing with joy. Focus your energy on manifesting that or bringing it closer to you in some way. Stepping outside your comfort zone in search of your passions can bring you incredible happiness and help you view the world through rose-colored glasses now.","This is a good day to let the universe take the wheel as it's steering you in the right direction! There is a beautiful energy channeling throughout the sky, and it will be impacting you in quite a fantastical way -- but only if you let it. Something you’re not aware of is headed your way, something that could benefit you in the long run. Instead of trying to push or pull in one specific direction, give yourself permission to be flexible and see how things unfold.","Checking in with the people in your life is a terrific idea today, especially those with whom you might have lost touch over the last year or so. You don’t need to show up with your hat in hand, hoping people will understand why you’ve been MIA; they will understand more than you could know. You’ll probably have a lot of laughs once you get on the phone and start catching up. They might even have something important to tell you, so reach out!","The day starts off on a quiet note for you, so you’re welcome to take things slow and not rush through anything -- although you’ve never been one to fail to cross your t’s and dot your i’s. The mood will pick up come the evening, however, giving you a fresh burst of energy. Let it inspire you to turn your attention to your personal passions and nothing else. Do something that will bring you pleasure, and don’t worry about what other people might say about it.","A really positive energy is coming your way today, and while you might have work in front of you, you don’t have to let these doldrums take center stage, not when it's you who should be on full display. The general mood is encouraging you to step into the spotlight and put on a little show, even an impromptu one, to remind people just how wonderfully capable you are. If you have any creative projects on the back-burner, now is the time to move them to the heat.","There’s a professional flavor to the day, but that doesn’t mean you need to climb every mountain you can see or worry that you’re not achieving your goals fast enough. Rather, it’s time to do a check-in and see if those goals are actually waiting for you at the end of the path you’re on. If you look ahead and see they aren’t, then it’s time for some course correction. Take a step back and get some perspective, then start again.","The universe is giving you the chance to open your world up a bit today, which is probably welcome news after the last year or so. If you’ve been feeling boxed in, then look around your life for unusual ways to change this up -- whether that means diving into a new subject you’ve never studied before or planning a future trip to a far-off country you’ve always wanted to visit. Either way, it’s a wonderful day to make the first steps in a new direction.","Things could feel somewhat heavy today, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing; in fact, the best way to handle this cosmic influence is to dive in and immerse yourself in it. If there are issues you’ve been sweeping under the rug, you should give them their due attention and see what you can fix and what you might need to outsource. If you leave these things for too long you might get burned, so deal with them now rather than wait another day.","Today isn’t just about you but you in relation to the important people in your life. If things have become a bit one-sided, whether on your side or on theirs, then now is the perfect time to ensure that the scales are balanced out and everyone is pulling their weight while still enjoying the connection. First make sure you’re doing your part, and then if you realize someone isn’t doing theirs, then it’s alright to call them out and improve the situation.","The planets are acting like a nutritionist-trainer-life coach combo for you today, encouraging you to get your act together and make sure you have been taking proper care of yourself. You don’t need to live a completely disciplined existence, but you should be doing what you can to be healthy, practice self-care, and have achievable goals. If you’ve wandered a bit too far into unhealthy territory, it’s time to get back on the wagon and treat your mind and body right."
2021-05-20,"The pace of life picks up significantly today as the energizing Sun moves into agile Gemini at 3:37 pm EST. Our minds start moving quickly and conversations take on an upbeat tone. Meanwhile, the receptive Moon will dance with the ""Cosmic Lovers"" throughout the evening, first creating a tense square with pleasure-loving Venus, followed by a supportive sextile with energizer Mars. Responsibilities can wait -- right now, our priorities should be pleasurable activities and enjoyable moments with people we care about.","Starting today it feels like things are happening faster and more frequently than they have in a while, and that's just your style. Opportunities to connect with people will come your way, but you may also be especially busy with lots of little tasks and appointments. Consider starting a planner if you don’t already have one, because this is just the beginning of this faster pace, and you’re going to be filling up that blank space in your schedule very soon.","There’s an efficient vibration coming your way, one that wants you to roll up your sleeves and get to work. You’re entering an especially lucrative time of year, which should sound like heaven to your money-loving sign. If you’ve been putting in the effort at work, then perhaps it is time to ask for a raise. However, if you feel that you aren’t getting the monetary recognition you deserve, then go ahead and start looking for greener pastures to spend your days. Know your worth.","Your time has arrived! The Sun dashes into your sign and your 1st House of Self today, encouraging you to rub the sleep out of your eyes and let in the light. If you’ve been living life in the shadows lately, now is the time to start showing people what you’re all about. It’s almost like you’re experiencing a second New Year, so set some fresh resolutions for yourself, because you’ll be able to achieve them with flying colors.","The energy is getting turned down for you today, so don’t be shocked if you’d rather just spend time alone and avoid people for a while. You’re entering one of the quietest times of the year for you, when the mood is more about detoxing old habits so you can make room for new things. The new things aren’t here just yet, but they’ll be coming along soon, and you need to create space for them so you don't miss them when they arrive.","There’s a change in the wind today that's giving you permission to step back from work and take time to connect with people and check in with them; you might have missed something important while you’ve been so busy manifesting professional gains out in the world. Whether someone has big news to share or they simply want to talk about what they've been up to, they'll appreciate your presence. Success at work matters to you, but remember, it's your personal relationships that support your journey to success.","You have a renewed sense of purpose now and the universe wants you to set your sights as high as you possibly can. You’re entering an incredibly auspicious time of year for manifesting your professional goals, so you should do your best to focus like a laser and make this period really count. VIPs and bosses will be happy to lend you a helping hand, although you’ll be so in your element that you probably won’t even need any help. Start climbing!","The universe is here to lift you up today, giving you wings so you can begin to experience freedom once again and start to explore the world -- even if only metaphorically -- on a level that will satisfy you mentally, physically, and spiritually. Start thinking about the things you’ve been missing out in the great wide yonder and take some steps to reach these places once again. It may just be early planning for now, but the anticipation of an upcoming adventure will sustain you.","Starting today, things are going to seem very intense for a while, like the cosmic thermostat has gotten cranked up a few notches. There are opportunities for growth coming your way, but it’s the kind of growth that creates diamonds -- slow, tense shifts beneath the surface that lead to major change. It’s time for you to create a few diamonds of your own, even if it might not be the most comfortable process. What big adjustments can you make? Start within, then work outward.","Even if you’re a person who prefers to handle most things on your own, you can’t deny that there are times when life is made easier because there is someone there to lend you a helping hand. Regardless of who this person is -- a friend, lover, or even a coworker -- you’re going to be receiving more support from the people in your life now, perhaps even some new people. They can help you in ways you haven't even thought of, as long as you let them in.","Even if you generally prefer to stay on top of all matters, it seems you might have been a little nonchalant about this recently. It's time to get things back in order. If you’ve fallen off any wellness wagons, be it with your sleep schedule, your diet, or an exercise routine, then hop back on now and make a point to stay there. It takes intention and effort to feel good, but the work is undeniably worth it.","There's a fresh fire burning within you now, kicking off an exciting period of enjoyment and expression. If you’ve been laying low lately or have found yourself dealing with everyone else’s issues, now is the time to return to your own personal program, putting your desires front and center. Although you can still share your experiences with others, focus on the things that bring you the most joy in this world, then chase after them without stopping.","Comfort and security become top priorities today, and you may find yourself wanting to spend more time at home or surrounded by family. It’s a good time to putter around the house and work on yourself rather than focusing on others or trying to push any major projects through. If you still feel the urge to make a difference, then try to apply this energy to your living space. Some redecorating or small renovations could really freshen up your energy and mood."
2021-05-21,"There's an intensity around us this morning as the Sun forms a powerful square to expansive Jupiter, turning up the volume all the way and forcing us to look up from our daydreams and pay attention to what is happening around us. Once evening falls, the sensitive Moon enters people-pleasing Libra, adding a social touch to our lives. This friendly atmosphere is amplified further as the Moon trines the Sun at the end of the day, making the party last that much later.","You are given an efficient boost today and you should make a point to get cracking on your responsibilities as soon as possible. It's important that you make the early hours count, because the evening is going to have a decidedly different tone -- one that is about coming together with someone important and enjoying yourselves. Check things off your to-do list one at a time, then leave your schedule open to let something -- or someone -- into your life.","The Muse has you in her sights today, sending you an ample dose of inspiration and creativity, so go ahead and heed her call when she tells you to express yourself. People will be impressed with your talents, especially if you don’t tend to put them on display very often, making it all the more important that you let your inner artist out to play now. The mood will become more low-key in the evening, so make the daylight hours count.","You're looking beyond the immediate moment now, eager to expand your possibilities and your vision of what success looks like to you. It’s a terrific time to think about your future and what you want to accomplish, and make certain steps in the right direction to achieve whatever is waiting for you beyond the horizon. Things will only get better for you after the Sun sets, so make a point to celebrate your efforts come the evening.","There’s a busy energy to the day, making it important to try and maintain your focus, lest you get distracted and totally thrown off course. You will benefit from setting up some sort of game plan or chore chart for yourself so you can keep an eye on all your tasks and tend to them without letting anything slip through the cracks. An efficient day should be rewarded with some self-care this evening, so tend to yourself in ways that make it all worth it.","There are fantastic opportunities today for you to manifest some money magic. If you’ve been working hard gearing up for a raise, then this would be a great time to ask for it. Likewise, if you’ve been hoping to earn your money elsewhere, start searching for your ideal position now, because it may be easier to find than usual. With the amount of hours you spend on the job, it's important that it be something you find rewarding.","This is a really good day for getting organized, whatever that might mean to you. If you need to tweak your diet a bit, update your exercise routine, or just find a way to shake off the doldrums, this is the perfect time to implement a change and stick to it. An opportunity could pop up late this evening when you’d expect things to quiet down, so if you receive any last-minute invitations, then consider this the cosmic clearance to say yes.","It’s a good day to take things easy, because the universe is going to speed up the pace as the hours go by -- the morning may move along like a quiet dream, but you will get jolted awake by the time the Sun sets. This won’t be a bad jolt; in fact, it looks like you’ll thoroughly enjoy yourself, but it’s best to conserve your energy during the day so you have ample supplies when the activity picks up in the evening.","Your mission today is to enjoy yourself as much as possible, and this includes not worrying too much about what you do with your time, as long as it involves something fun that brings you joy. Take a step back from your usual routines and try some new approach to living out loud. This could be a performative pursuit like dancing or singing, or something more tangible like sculpture or painting. Flex your creative side and see what you can manifest.","There’s a professional turn in the wind, encouraging you to use the daylight hours to your advantage, because things will change come nightfall. Check in with a VIP or boss about your performance as of late, and make sure there isn’t anything you might not have noticed was slipping through the cracks -- although chances are, you’ll get a stellar review of your recent work. Personal relationships take over later on, so make a point to connect with people this evening; it'll help to refresh and recharge you.","It looks like this is going to be a very busy day for you, one with lots of twists and turns and sudden changes, but that doesn’t have to be a major disruption. Try to get your nose to the grindstone early in the day and check as many things off your lists as you possibly can, so that those twists and turns don't affect you as much as the hours go by. Once you’ve slayed these dragons, you can look forward to a pleasant evening.","It appears you have an absolutely lovely day ahead of you, so make it a point to lighten your heart and seek out some pleasurable experiences. You might find that work requires some of your attention, but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing; in fact, it looks like you could manifest something amazing at the office, then turn around for an evening of celebrating at home with your nearest and dearest. All hard work deserves a reward, even if you're rewarding yourself.","You are on the brink of a whole new phase of your life, one that is going to bring a lot of new opportunities your way and start you on a fresh journey. Today, however, that energy is going to receive a bit of a check, which could make the idea of going anywhere feel like a bit of a drag. You may rather tend to things around the house than go conquer the world, but that’s just for now. Do what makes your soul happy."
2021-05-22,"Today the stars seem to blow hot and cold, pushing us in different directions as we’re knocked about by contradictory angles. The Moon is moving through personable Libra, and throughout the evening she’ll form a harmonious trine to sober Saturn, reminding us to get down to business regardless of the hour. This energy gets confused, however, when messenger Mercury forms a complicated square to foggy Neptune at 10:43 pm EDT, making it easy for conversations to veer into unknown territory.","A muddled energy is in the air, and it might make it rather difficult to figure out what exactly you’re trying to communicate to people. If it seems like everyone is speaking a foreign language to you, just hold off on trying to make sense of everything. Accept that information will be rather nebulous for the time being. If there are any important conversations you’ve been waiting to have, today is definitely not the day to give them a go.","The universe is pulling your focus in different directions now, and while this doesn’t have to be the end of the world, it will make it difficult to decide what you’re supposed to do with the hours you have. Work might need to get done and regular tasks may be calling your name, but it seems lots of people, perhaps a whole group of friends, will start blowing up your phone and begging for you to come and play. Don’t worry about making progress today.","Your brain seems to be traveling two separate paths today, and even though this isn’t the most abnormal thing for your mercurial sign, the day's energy is going to be a little more complicated. Professional matters are requiring you to roll up your sleeves and get to work, but trying to figure out how you’re supposed to be going about it might seem a little trickier. If you can’t stop daydreaming, then hold off on moving mountains in the here and now.","Your mind is floating through the world like a balloon today, but you don’t need to try to chase after it. Instead, let it go wherever it might, bounding across borders and barriers as if they never existed in the first place. Real, concrete progress is going to evade everyone now, so use this time to fantasize and consider ideas you might normally dismiss as outlandish or impossible. Every once in a while these can turn out to be more realistic than you’d ever imagined.","Trying to figure out what part of yourself to put on display can leave you bouncing back and forth between extremes today. You can either be very social and outgoing, or you can be mysterious and keep your cards close to your chest. There’s no wrong or right answer -- you can be whomever you want to be! The difficult part comes from having to make that decision. Accepting the fluidity of the day can help you with that, and then you can be more grounded tomorrow.","There could be a dissonance between your priorities right now, so it's possible you'll feel a bit of stress figuring out where to put all your exacting energy. Your professional life and your personal life are going to come calling in equal measure, making it all too easy for you to feel tossed back and forth wildly between social obligations and work matters. Don’t pressure yourself to achieve everything today. The best thing you can do is be honest if you start to get overwhelmed.","The universe is sending you off in various directions at the moment, which may well leave you scratching your head as you try to figure out where you’re really supposed to be going. The simple fact is that progress isn’t going to be easily made today, because every time you think you’ve figured out your destination, the path will suddenly become obscured by fog. Allow things to be confusing for a little while and trust that they will become clearer in a day or two.","There’s a serious vibration to your day, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find opportunities to enjoy yourself. Use the daylight hours to achieve as much as possible, because there are going to be some important matters up for inspection. You can make headway on these more easily than usual, so try not to fritter the day away. Fortunately, the evening will offer you a chance to kick back and relax, so you’ll be able to find balance as the hours pass.","People could be a bit of a problem today in that it'll seem as though they can't leave you alone. Normally you wouldn’t be too miffed about this, but it's possible you’re going to be more in the mood to keep things low-key and work on your own projects as opposed to spending time socializing. If this is the case, politely decline any offers you don’t want to accept and let people know you’ll get back to them in a few days.","Getting your message across could be rather difficult right now, as it will feel like the stars are causing your every word to jumble up in your mouth before you can speak it into being. It would be best to hold back from any important conversations today, especially those regarding work, as your audience won’t be nearly as receptive as they ought to be. Hold off for the time being, then give it another shot under clearer skies.","It’s one of those days when the cosmos isn’t going to make it easy for you to decide what to do with yourself, so don’t be shocked if you feel like you’re twiddling your thumbs while you wait for something to happen. Your mind will be oriented towards the more pleasurable sides of life, but work will require your attention too. Handle this with grace by bouncing back and forth between something creative and your professional responsibilities without worrying what others think.","You're being urged to focus on the more serious aspects of life today. While that probably doesn’t strike you as the most exciting prospect, you’ve got to deal with these matters sooner or later, so you might as well roll up your sleeves and get to it! You'll be able to cut through the fat and get to the heart of the matter quickly, and you’ll feel good about yourself when the day winds down and you see just how much you’ve accomplished."
2021-05-23,"The universe is taking its foot off the gas today thanks to karmic Saturn turning retrograde at 5:21 am EDT. For the next five months, this energy will encourage us to examine the structures of our lives and make sure they're built upon solid foundations. The sociable Moon will form a harmonious alignment with talkative Mercury midday, making it a good time to have lunch with friends. Once the Moon leaves behind Libra and enters private Scorpio later this evening, steamy vibes will take over.","A major cosmic shift is occurring today, and it is asking you to start taking a close look at all the casual connections in your life. It’s possible you have accumulated a few extra “friends” who aren’t actually bringing all that much into your world. If that's the case, you might be giving more to them than they are to you. If you and those people aren’t on the same page, then try to figure out how to get on the same page ... or if that's even possible.","Today’s energy encourages you to change tack. You’ve been pushing your way up the cosmic career ladder for quite some time and making undeniable progress, but it’s time to start examining that progress to ensure what you’ve built is on top of a firm foundation. Has your ascent been unassailable, or were there some potholes along the way? It would be a good idea to go back and fill those potholes in now, before you try and continue making any extraordinary leaps forward.","You’ve had to look deeply inward for a long time since you couldn’t expand and explore the world in quite the same ways you were able to before. In order to acclimate to the changing tides of life, something about you has changed on a deep level. Today it’s important to take stock of the ways you’ve evolved and make sure the old you and the new you are working together for your benefit. If there’s a dissonance, try to smooth it out.","There is a noticeable change in the energy today, and it’s encouraging you to take a step back from the rat race and do some inner work for a while. You’ve endured a lot, and while it has made you stronger in many ways, you still have sensitive sides to you. Allowing yourself to have vulnerabilities as well as strengths is important, but you might have outgrown some of these when you weren’t looking. Take a look inside now -- maybe your weaknesses have become your strengths.","You're being encouraged to take a step back from your usual program and turn your attention to the important people in your life today. You’ve changed a lot recently, and there is a good chance this has impacted your relationships -- be they professional, platonic, or romantic. You need to examine these relationships and make sure you and these other people still fit together. Have you evolved in complementary ways? If you’ve only grown apart, then perhaps that’s for the best.","Your sign is known for being on top of things, but sometimes that reputation doesn't match the reality. However, you have the ability to be incredibly organized and efficient when you try. Today you're being urged to take some time to aim high and be the best you can be. Consider your daily life, identifying the behaviors that are mucking up the works and preventing you from going as far as you can go. By eliminating these roadblocks, you’ll be able to run that much further.","The center of your focus may change today, turning away from outward expression and instead focusing on your own inner talents and passions. What specifically drives you to go after what you want? You are being invited to make sure that the way you express yourself reflects the inner you, the part of yourself that closely guards your greatest hopes and desires. Make sure you’re being genuine in all your endeavors now because the planets will reward authenticity.","It’s no secret that you’ve had to spend more time at home over the last year or so than is normal, but that doesn’t mean you’ve remained static. You’ve probably made a lot of changes to the way you occupy your space, as well as to the connections you have with the people you live with, whether they're roommates, blood family, or somewhere in between. Starting today, you should size up these changes and decide what you will keep with you as you move into the future.","You’ve changed a lot in the way you interact with others -- circumstances have certainly required that. While it’s been difficult and required a lot of adjustments, that doesn’t mean it has all been for the worse. You’ve evolved alongside those changes, becoming more focused on how you get your ideas across, and now there is a golden nugget of information waiting to be uncovered. Make it a point to talk to people today -- what you learn could be life-changing.","The cosmos is encouraging you to get down to basics, pare down any bells and whistles, and deal with the facts today. This is especially important in relation to your professional life. If things have gotten a little out of sorts or a bit convoluted, now is the time to make sure that everything is on the up and up. If a work situation has reached its expiration date, consider this a cue to start looking elsewhere for a paycheck.","There’s a big burst of energy focusing right on you today! However, rather than using this to blast off towards new horizons, the universe wants you to use this time to look around your life. Search out any cracks in the surface or problem zones that might need your attention and see what you can do to improve the situation. Even if there’s nothing begging for your focus, you can probably find a few places where you can achieve self-improvement and gain experience in the process.","The stars are shining a light on you today, but they’re doing so from some strange location you can’t quite seem to find. You’re being invited to tune out from your usual approach to life and tap into your sixth sense to look for messages that are meant for you and only you. Instead of trying to read the world like a book, use your intuition and feel your way. It’s a great day to meditate or focus on other forms of mental health and self-care."
2021-05-24,"We're stuck in a push-pull today as the tense Moon in Scorpio forms a number of angles to other planets, each as different as the last. Very early in the day, she creates a harmonious trine with bountiful Jupiter, bringing some sweet dreams our way. The mood shifts dramatically come the evening, however, when the Moon opposes rebellious Uranus at 6:15 pm EDT, only to turn around and square off with karmic Saturn. It’s best to accept that roadblocks will be prevalent, but not permanent.","You may be in the mood to keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself today, no matter how hard someone else tries to pry them open. It’s fine to do things by your own rules, but remember that if you don’t let people know that you’re taking some time for yourself, they might react in a negative manner. Watch out for hurt feelings in the evening especially -- misunderstandings are easily made tonight, but also easily fixed.","Maintaining a sense of equilibrium might be rather difficult today, as you ricochet from one task to another, pushed along by other people when you’d rather be the driving force of your life. Try to take things one step at a time so you don’t get overwhelmed by the expectations placed on you. A last-minute responsibility might require your attention this evening when you’d rather just kick back and relax, so try to meet it with grace and you should get through it quickly enough.","There are going to be a lot of things that require your attention today, making it important that you stay organized, even if everyone around you is running around wildly. If you don’t have a clear-cut set of chores or responsibilities, make a checklist so you can keep track of everything and maintain your sense of sanity. An opportunity to show off this capable side of yourself may come in the evening, so don’t drop the ball just because you’ve clocked out.","Life might feel a bit like a carnival today, sending you on an exciting ride. There’s plenty to enjoy and you can indeed go wild, but it’s important to remember that there’s a point where things stop being fun if you overdo it -- then you're left not feeling well and wondering why you went overboard. Instant gratification will be tempting today, but if you can manage to have fun in moderation, it will stay fun all day.","You could be feeling more sensitive today than usual, although it may prove difficult to figure out exactly why you’re feeling this way. The important thing is to not let your buttons get pushed by anyone who doesn't have your best interests at heart. Take appropriate space for yourself, but try to do so diplomatically. It will be easy to get argumentative in the evening, so if you can’t say anything nice, try to keep it to yourself.","There’s a busy beat to the day, and although you’re better than most at keeping track of everything, even you might find yourself getting a little overwhelmed by just how much there is to handle. If there are any matters that can wait for another day, push them to the backburner, because you won’t be nearly as effective if you’re stretched too thin. Be honest with yourself and with others when it comes to these matters; people will be flexible to meet your needs.","You may have to deal with lots of little, mundane things today -- things that probably don’t seem all that appealing at first glance, including financial matters. There’s a chance you might have missed some important details, like a few recurring charges that ought to be canceled, or perhaps there’s an upcoming bill you forgot about. Take today to check yourself and your accounts so that no nasty surprises come when you least expect them. A little effort today could save you from a headache later on.","Be prepared for people to clamor for your attention today, whether you like it or not. It'll be important that you find little pockets of time throughout the day for you to get some space to yourself. You can only give so much before you need to refill your own tank, and if you don’t make a point to do so, then you could run out of gas at a crucial moment. Listen to your mind and body first.","Today could seem rather fantastical to you, and while that might sound lovely, in reality, it may be something else entirely. There’s a lot going on around you, and it will be easy to lose your way amidst all the constant and frenetic energy, and even easier to lose sight of what you’re really supposed to be doing. Try to find some equilibrium and stability in these changing tides so that they don’t drag you out to sea when you’re supposed to be accomplishing things on the shore.","Your attention is valuable today and people are going to do everything they can to get it. It's totally fine if you want to pay attention, but if you have other things you must attend to, then you’re going to need to draw a line in the sand and make it clear where your limits lie. People can’t make these boundaries for you, and unless you identify them, then no one will know they are there in the first place. Draw attention to your limits.","There’s a lot of change in the wind -- the kind of change that can cause things to transform before your very eyes. Things you thought you understood may now turn out to be an entirely different beast than you originally thought. Don’t judge a book by its cover today because you’ll wish you hadn't. You should make a point to read between the lines, however. The things that you can see and hear are only part of the story.","It might seem like a voice is beckoning you from far away, calling your name and asking you to look beyond your own surroundings for satisfaction. That may seem lovely at first, however, this voice is more of a siren call than anything, and you would be smart to try and ignore it so that you don’t wind up getting dragged off the path you’re meant to be following. Stick to your guns and don’t let any shiny objects distract you; they’re only fool’s gold."
2021-05-25,"It’s a beautiful day for making things happen, as the planets are pushing us along without any turbulence to slow us down. The Moon will connect with energizer Mars early in the day, making it easy for us to wake up and hit the ground running. She’ll form another harmonious alignment with dreamy Neptune at 11:30 am EDT, allowing us to take things at a gentler pace if we prefer. Late tonight, the Moon will dive into outgoing Sagittarius, making us eager to get tomorrow started.","There’s a flurry of activity around your house today, so don’t be surprised if things seem to go off within your own walls. Fortunately, this is positive energy, and you can use it to your advantage -- especially to bring about any necessary changes you’ve been putting off. Spend some time looking at home decor blogs or other sources of inspiration, then try to bring that same spark to your own space. A little change will reinvigorate your energy.","This is a wonderful day to connect with people, and even if you haven’t had the easiest time doing that recently, today, your efforts are as effective as a hot knife through butter. Someone special could present an opportunity to you or do something that totally changes your plans, so try to be open and flexible because you never know what exciting things may come of it. You don’t have to be the life of the party, you just have to have fun.","There’s a pep in your step first thing this morning, and it is driving you to accomplish as much as you can without stopping. If there is anything you’ve had on the backburner or have held off on tackling because it is a bit overwhelming, know that you have the necessary drive to tackle anything today. Approach these matters head-on because they could take much less effort than you’d first anticipated. Put in the work and you can move mountains today.","No matter how much you may want to hide away today, this is the last thing you should do. There’s a fire in your tank so you might as well use it to your advantage and make some magic. The nice thing is that you don’t have to use this energy for dull tasks, rather, you can dedicate it to pursuing pleasures without feeling any sense of guilt. You can manifest things easier than usual now, so go after what you want.","Go ahead and move at your own pace today, knowing that your agenda is the only one that matters. You have people looking out for you from the sidelines, so don’t be shocked if a guardian angel emerges to bring a blessing or two into your life. The energy will pick up in the afternoon, so you may slowly increase your speed as you go along. Still, the more energy you conserve during the day, the more you'll have for good times in the evening.","You have every reason to do as you please today. You’ve been putting in plenty of effort lately, and even your efficient sign needs to take a break from time to time. It’ll be all too easy to break down if you don’t stop for the usual maintenance, but the good thing is, you get to decide what that maintenance is for you. Watch one of your favorite movies, eat your favorite meal -- anything that brings a smile to your face is good for you now.","You can manifest some serious magic on the work front today, and it looks like you’ll have a bit of help in the process. A VIP or other superior may finally recognize all the effort you’ve been putting in, and you’ll be more than happy if that recognition comes with a financial bonus. You can wait around for things to happen, but the biggest rewards may come when you ask for what you want -- make a list of your skills and use it to make your case.","This could be one of the loveliest days you’ve experienced in some time, a day when roadblocks and barriers seem to evaporate as soon as they present themselves. Try not to get bogged down with little problems and instead focus on the bigger picture. Set your sights where you want to go, then figure out what you need to get there; the answers will present themselves, and so will the means to manage it all without breaking a sweat.","This is going to be a rather intense day, so don’t be shocked if it seems that everyone else is on edge. Still, you can exist in this territory without letting it impact you negatively; it would behoove you to use this intensity as an asset rather than letting it cause you anxiety or stress. Don’t think of this as a crisis or a struggle, think of it as an opportunity to engage with life as fully as possible.","Thinking outside the box and trying an unusual approach could help you solve an old problem. While you may prefer to play things by the rulebook, you’ll have a more rewarding experience now if you step outside of these usual parameters and try showing off a creative flare in how you handle matters. It might catch others off guard at first, but they’ll soon be very impressed with you when they see how just much you’ve managed to accomplish.","There’s an extra efficiency in all that you do now, so it would be in your best interest to use this to your advantage and get your life in order. Look around and be honest with yourself; if there is any area in which you’ve been dropping the ball or falling short, now is the perfect time to pick up the slack and get things together. Fortunately, you won’t have to work too hard to see good results, so don’t worry that breaking a sweat will break your spirit.","Today should be all about enjoying yourself, whatever that might mean to you. You have a lot of energy, so use that to propel yourself in any direction your heart desires. Love and laughter and play will revive your spirit. It’s also a wonderful time for self-expression, so go ahead and get creative. A painting or poem could be the perfect medium for channeling this buoyancy, and people are sure to love whatever it is that you produce."
2021-05-26,"We may be tempted to take things too far while the Moon squares boundless Jupiter in the early hours of the day. The rest of the morning is even more powerful, as a beautiful Lunar Eclipse in Sagittarius activates the skies at 7:14 am EDT. We can use this energy to blast off to new vistas, and we should go as far as we can, because in the evening the Moon will move into a supportive sextile with hardworking Saturn, making our efforts well worth it.","A fresh breeze is tapping at your window today, encouraging you to open up and let the world in. This is a beautiful moment to begin breaking down any barriers that you’ve built up around yourself over the last six months, and start deciding how you’re going to dive into this heady new world that is now available to you. Look for fresh ways to increase the value of your life by bringing in modern influences and expanding your horizons.","The galaxy is bubbling up like a celestial cauldron, bringing something powerful to the surface. This part of you may have been hidden from sight for months while it was refined over and over, like alchemists trying to turn base metal into gold. This time, however, the gold is within you, and you are the alchemist manifesting it into your life. There is something magical inside you that is coming to life, so go ahead and show the world what you’ve got to offer.","The universe emphasizes the partners in your life on a powerful level today. This isn’t limited to romance -- it includes anyone with whom you have a balanced relationship, be it a close friend, a coworker, or indeed a lover. You could witness a major transformation with someone as your partnership reaches a new level. This is also a terrific time for negotiations and making deals, so if there are any contracts on the table, you’ve got cosmic clearance to sign on the dotted line.","The stars are presenting you with an opportunity to totally transform yourself from the inside out. If you’ve felt like your life has been unorganized, messy, or just plain confusing, here’s a chance to start ironing out the wrinkles and making it look more like the one you've always dreamed of for yourself. Likewise, if you’ve already been putting in the work to get your life together, today could bring a sign that you are on the right track and the world is taking notice.","This is a very creative and expressive time for you! While you’re rarely one to sit back and avoid the limelight, this is truly a day to step up and let people hear you roar. If you’re of the artistic persuasion, then seize the day and put your talents on display. Taking a leap of faith could result in some fabulous rewards coming towards you, be they recognition and acclaim or perhaps even cold, hard cash. You know you deserve it.","The winds of change are blowing right through your front door. You’ve probably experienced life closer to home for the last year or so, and while that’s been difficult in many ways, it hasn’t been all for the worse. Today, a blast of energy focuses on your home and family life, and it could bring a major transformation to the way you live now. You’ll likely be thrilled about the changes occurring under your roof, so you may even want to usher some in yourself.","There could be some very important information coming your way today, so keep your ears open and your eyes peeled. It might arrive in the form of a message, or perhaps it will be more discrete, wrapped up in some sort of event or other experience. The likelihood that it will happen close to home or come from someone very dear to you is strong. The information that is revealed has the potential to change everything, so pay attention.","Your financial state is highlighted right now, and this could bring a lot of changes to how you earn your money and what you do with it. These changes won’t likely relate to something entirely unexpected, but rather something you’ve been working on for quite some time. Perhaps you’ll get that raise you’ve been angling for, or maybe that job you’ve spent weeks pursuing will give you the metaphorical green light. You have the chance to manifest material magic now more than ever.","This day’s energy is all about you, so consider this your opportunity to put yourself front and center without any reservations. You’re being encouraged to leave behind any behaviors or patterns that no longer serve you, and to instead consider striking out in a new direction or renewing your dedication to the path in front of you -- provided it’s the one you truly want to be on. You can make huge amounts of progress now if you put your mind to it and put in the effort.","The stars inspire change today, aiding you in metaphorically shedding your old skin. You are entering a powerful period of renewal, during which a lot of things in your life could change for the better. Before you can enact those changes, you should first let go of some old habits or ideas. Releasing the person you used to be will help you make room for new parts of yourself when they finally arrive to help you start a whole new life.","Like a fisherman casting their net into the great ocean, you’re currently being prompted to connect with people by casting your own net as wide as you can over your social circle. You have a lot of cosmic support right now and it seems that you’ll be able to gather up a great catch. Amongst everyone in your net, you're likely to find some solid nuggets of friendship gold gifted from the universe straight to you. Take advantage of the abundance and draw them in!","Set your sights high today by picking out a spot on the horizon and making it your goal. Even if that place looks like it will take forever to reach, the universe is here to make your journey easier, pushing you along with a wind at your back. With its help, you might find you arrive much faster than expected. Pick where you want to go, and if you do the work, you’ll get there in no time."
2021-05-27,"All the feelings of today could have us seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, leading to varied results. The emotional Moon in Sagittarius will oppose pleasure-loving Venus at 10:43 am EDT, giving us the desire to wear our hearts on our sleeves, but this afternoon, we’ll need to be careful about missing red flags as Venus squares off against elusive Neptune. We’ll have an easier time getting a grip when the Moon shifts into grounded Capricorn later this evening.","You might experience a few hiccups today as you try to engage with others. Luckily, these faux pas won’t be complete gaffes, but rather little and easily excused mistakes or miscommunications. There’s a chance you and another person might try to come together, only to realize you’ve been operating from completely different places. While it’s possible that you two can find a way to get on the same page, it’s definitely going to require work and clarity to do so right now.","A dissonance in the planets above makes it tough for you to figure out what you should focus on throughout the day. It might seem preferable to pay attention to the work in front of you, and indeed you could make progress in this arena. However, people may be something of a distraction. If you need to turn your phone on silent in order to get things done, then do so. You can always reply to people later.","The planets are focusing on you today, which is a lovely thing in theory. Unfortunately, while some will send a beautiful beam of energy your way, not all of them will be quite so helpful. A wall of fog obscures your ambitions, getting in the way of making any real progress. Your best bet at this moment is to sit back and play around in your own sandbox. Worry about climbing mountains another day; they will still be there when the fog lifts.","A path is opening up in front of you, but it is hardly a clear one. This road forms many twists and turns, seeming to be solid one moment but disappearing before your very eyes the next. The lesson to take away from this is that you have a choice today: you can go as far as you please or stay close to home, literally or metaphorically. Don’t create expectations for your day; instead, allow yourself to have options. There’s no pressure.","Insistent energies lend a tug-of-war feeling to the day, pulling you between feeling light and breezy versus heavy and complicated. That isn’t to say you need to set up camp in one specific area or that you can’t indulge in both, but that the moment you decide to take things easy, you might find a wind of intense energy blows your way. Conversely, if you lean into the complexity, you may automatically want to shake it off. Remember, there’s no right or wrong approach to this situation.","You could achieve a lot today, but things that look simple may turn out to be more complicated than you’d ever anticipated. It’s not that the tasks in front of you are especially difficult; in fact, you might rather enjoy them for their own merits. The problem is that, intentionally or not, other people are likely to get in the way of your accomplishments. Don’t let anyone rain on your parade for too long, but accept that the parade may need to make a few stops.","The planets are broadening your horizons, revealing some wonderful opportunities that could be yours for the taking. However, while you’re sizing up these possibilities, something may throw a wrench in the works and trip you up before you can start pursuing them. This wrench is probably going to be work-related, or deal with some sort of responsibility, so it would be wise to accept that finishing your work is a requirement before you can go off on any adventures.","Conflicting energy is coming towards you, making it difficult for you to figure out in which direction your destiny lies. Today you could make an effort to chase after your hopes and dreams, only to be reminded of important matters in the here and now that require your attention before you can do anything else. Start the day by grounding yourself and getting organized, then go from there and continue improving your options with each completed task.","This morning you might want to lounge around in bed, take things easy, and limit your social interactions for the most part. It’s fine to take some time away from people, but they probably will be trying to get your attention regardless, so accept that you’ll only be able to keep them at bay for so long. Fortunately, it looks like all they want is to bring good things to your figurative door, so open up and let in the abundance!","You’ve got pep in your step and are ready to roll up your sleeves and make the day count -- but that may not be the case for everyone else. While you hit the ground running and check off every box on your to-do list, you might notice other people making it rather difficult to focus. They could drop the ball or not put in your level of work. Be patient with others; everything will happen in its own time.","Work matters are going to seem rather nebulous today, like no matter how hard you try to focus, you keep missing the big picture. This is likely to continue throughout the day, so give yourself permission to take a step back and accept that there are better and more pleasant ways to spend your time right now. Indulge yourself in some fun hobbies or other things that take your mind off your responsibilities -- you can get back to them tomorrow.","Your mind is in a haze today, making this a good day to putter around the house and to take things one step at a time. This haze may not lift easily, so for now it would be best to focus on feeling rather than thinking your way through the day. Delve into some creative expression or perhaps some redecorating. Moving a couple pieces of furniture around or changing up the aesthetics of a few rooms could breathe fresh air into your life."
2021-05-28,"There’s an expansive yet productive energy to the day as the Moon is spinning through can-do Capricorn. She’ll reach out and form a supportive sextile with bountiful Jupiter in fantastical Pisces in the early hours, making our dreams that much more vivid. The waking hours encourage more grounded thinking, but a dose of eccentricity will be welcome when the Moon makes a beautiful trine with rebellious Uranus at 6:22 pm EDT; it’s a good time for positive surprises and thinking outside of our usual boundaries.","You’ve got every reason to act out today, but not just in any old way; rather, look for ways to shake things up when it comes to your career and finances, because those areas could use a bit of dusting off. You’re not one to get stuck in a rut easily, but it can still happen, so if you’ve been puttering about, trying the same old methods, make a point to take a different approach to success. Put your unique style on display for everyone.","Your focus is shifting to the wide world beyond your own backyard, so look as far as possible for your inspiration today. You’ve probably been shut off from things for so long that you’ve forgotten what it’s like to be able to stretch your mind and see what the rest of the world has to offer. Take some time today to begin searching out new ways to exist that can freshen up your daily life. A change will do wonders for your spirit.","You have every reason to follow your intuition today, and it looks like it's going to lead you somewhere wonderful. There’s a message or some information that's meant just for you, but you won’t be able to uncover it by asking directly; you need to release control and let life guide you, like a leaf floating along the surface of a winding river. Although you may know your destination, you could be taken on a magical journey.","People don’t always know what’s best for you, so it’s usually wise to make up your own mind about important matters. Today, however, someone may step forward with some advice or words of wisdom, and it would behoove you to listen and absorb their message. Perhaps they are only underlining a fact that you already know, but it looks like the core idea is a very important one, so be a good listener and receive all that you can.","Efficient vibrations are headed toward you, encouraging you to do everything you can to make today as productive as possible. You can really benefit yourself by taking some time to seek out any weak spots in your daily life. For example, if you’ve let your diet or exercise routine fall to the wayside, now is the time to get it back on track so that you’re working at top capacity. You don’t have to change overnight; small steps can take you far.","Although you may not be one to rock the boat or draw attention to yourself, it wouldn’t hurt to make a bit of a scene today. You can put on a show to whatever degree you like, as long as you don’t bother worrying about what other people will think. Don’t hide out in the wings waiting for someone to offer you the spotlight; take it for yourself and show just how much you belong there. You truly do.","You might find yourself feeling rather sensitive today, so think about putting on a suit of armor as you wake up this morning and prepare to meet the world head-on. Someone could press a few of your buttons without even meaning to, but just because it’s an accident doesn’t make it a fun experience. Take space as you need it, and if you want to remove yourself from a situation, then go ahead and say so, politely.","Feelings of camaraderie and bonding can bring you support today. Think about linking up with a close friend and spending time catching up and doing things that remind you of why your relationship is so important in the first place. You may be a rather private person, but you can open up with people you truly trust, so make sure you’re surrounding yourself only with the people who know you best. You'll feel less vulnerable if they already know your secrets.","You’ve got your mind on your money today, thanks to the universe focusing its energies on your financial sector. If you’ve been looking for a new way to earn an income, now is the time to take a different approach and start considering moneymaking schemes you’d never once considered. Perhaps it’s time to ask for a raise, or even seek out a part-time job to meet your needs. The more unusual the solution, the better it may suit you in the long run.","Even a buttoned-up Capricorn like you needs to let loose every so often and show the world that you’re more than the ideal image of responsibility. Today you may have the chance to do just that, but this won't be an opportunity that's handed to you from anyone else -- it's up to you to take the initiative and put this side of yourself on display. It could do you a world of good to shake things up now.","There’s quite a bit of energy focused on your home and family today, energy that may feel like shockwaves. This doesn’t have to be a bad thing, though -- in fact, why not make a point to be the shockwave yourself, rather than be controlled by them? You could do something as simple as move around a few pieces of furniture, or come up with a surprise activity for everyone in your family to get involved with. Inviting change will be far more beneficial to you than avoiding it.","People are calling your name today and you would be wise to answer. A very unexpected and surprising opportunity could fall into your lap -- coming in the form of a text, phone call, or other sort of communication -- and the last thing you’ll want is to miss out on it. This isn't a day to keep quiet and hide away, so don’t play the wallflower and turn down any invitations -- chances are, you’ll wish you'd taken the chance."
2021-05-29,"There’s a palpable change in the heavens today that will be difficult to miss. Messenger Mercury and lovely Venus will join together in the morning, making it feel natural for us to speak from the heart. Later on the Moon connects with revealing Pluto, bringing our desires to the surface, but we need to be careful about getting carried away. The big shift comes when Mercury turns retrograde in communicative Gemini at 6:34 pm EST, making it all too easy for wires to get crossed; handle everything with care.","You don't want to end up with your foot in your mouth today, so while your sign normally prefers to shoot from the hip, it would be wiser to think before you speak. People may not be on the same page as you, and it’s a waste of your energy and time trying to get your point across when you have to jump through so many hoops just to make yourself heard. Write down your thoughts for now and pick what you really want to say later.","It’s never fun to have nasty surprises come up, especially in your finances; on top of the dent it makes in your bank account, your sign really hates to have your stability shaken. In order to avoid any shocks, take some time to go through your accounts and your spending habits and make sure everything is on the up-and-up. You might need to change your approach in the short-term to benefit yourself in the long-term, but the results will be worth it.","Although you might have a good idea of where you’re going in life, or at least where you’d like to wind up, today it may feel like the path in front of you has become rather obscured. There’s a fog over the road, and more potholes than you’re prepared for. Walk slowly for now and test every step before you put your full weight into it; it’s easy to trip and fall if you don’t watch where you’re going.","Normally it’s a very good thing to listen to your intuition; after all, that inner voice is supposed to know what’s best for you, even if you're having a difficult time figuring that out. Today, however, that inner voice might get a little scrambled, and you may not be able to understand what it’s trying to tell you. Focus on the reality in front of you and avoid reading between the lines; the message won’t be what you think it is.","There’s a bit of conflict in the air today, and it could make itself known through the people in your life. Everyone around you may be in some kind of bad mood, and no matter how hard you try to connect, there seems to be a wall getting in the way of proper communication. If you have a serious subject to discuss, put it on the backburner for now; people will probably be more receptive in a few days.","You may have been running up the hill of your professional life for quite some time now, and made good progress. Today, however, you’re going to need to be a bit more careful in how fast you’re going. A VIP or boss might be the one to hold up a stop sign and tell you to slow your pace, so tread carefully. Your plans could require a detour or a bit of rerouting, so try to be flexible in your goals.","The world is starting to open up to you again and life may feel more vibrant than it has in some time. Still, this doesn’t mean you can just jet off into the great wide yonder without any sort of plan or strategy. It’s important to take everything slowly and plan carefully, while understanding that things are still shifting and that even the best laid plans may require some reworking. You can stretch your wings, but don’t fly too far from the ground for now.","Your passionate nature drives you to go to the Moon and back for the people in your life, but the sad truth is that not everyone is worth all the effort. Right now, you should be careful about bending over backward for just anyone; be a little selfish with your own energies. If someone is truly worth it, then that will become clear on its own, but it’s better to find that out before you make sacrifices on their behalf.","You could run into a stumbling block today when it comes to your relationships, be they platonic, professional, or romantic. This isn’t to say that you are going to start locking horns with everyone in your life, but that you need to make a point to be extra clear about what you mean when communicating, and that you shouldn’t assume anything about another person. Unless someone is giving you a crystal-clear explanation, hold off on coming to your own conclusions about anything for now.","Starting today, your work life may become a little confusing for the next couple of weeks. This isn’t about your big goals or long-term ambitions, but rather the daily grind that helps you earn your keep. Co-workers or clients might not be as helpful as usual, or throw wrenches in your plans when you thought everything was already taken care of. Check your work multiple times before submitting anything, but still give everyone a spot of grace for error, including you.","Putting yourself out there and letting people see all that you have to offer could really benefit you now. However, if you run out into the spotlight without anything prepared, there’s no guarantee that your impromptu performance will go off without a hitch. In fact, there are a few cosmic pitfalls in your way right now, so you’d be wise to rehearse everything before you put it on display; practice makes perfect, or as close as one can get.","It’s no secret that you’ve spent more time close to home over the last year or so, but it appears there are still a few matters yet to be taken care of -- either in your physical home or with the people who occupy that space with you. You may end up bumping heads when you’d rather get along, so give everyone their space, including yourself. Retreat from any battles today, because there will be no clear winner."
2021-05-30,"The universe is trying to send some clear signals our way. As the Moon enters brilliant Aquarius shortly after midnight, we can look to the future and create ideas to help us in the long term. Our minds will sparkle -- especially in the afternoon when the Moon trines the energetic Sun in Gemini, encouraging us to speak our mind. Let these thoughts turn into something productive this evening as the Moon aligns with hard-working Saturn at 11:25 pm EDT. What we do now has the power to last.","Connecting with people is less complicated than usual today, so be sure to open lines of communication. A small thought can transform into a big idea with the help of a few friends, and that big idea could turn into something useful and perhaps even profitable down the road. Be willing to think outside of the box! While tempering your thoughts with reality is important, a little ingenuity will take you far right now. Jot down any last-minute ideas before bed.","A bounce in your step helps you climb to new heights today, so it's a good day to put your nose to the grindstone, whether or not you’ve got work in front of you. You’re being spurred onward to capitalize on previous work and finally get your dues for all the effort you’ve expended while waiting for proper recognition to come your way. Seek out problem areas and make it a point to fix them before anyone else can notice the cracks in the wall.","Something special arrives on the wind today, encouraging you to open the windows and let it in, so take a breath of fresh air and embrace this feeling! If you’ve felt stifled or stymied in some way, use this opportunity to break down any barriers around you. The time has come to put your brilliant mind to use and figure out how you can move past these issues. If it’s too much on your own, it’s okay to ask for help.","Life and reality can often be complicated, but every once in a while they can also feel like a wonderful fairytale. Today the universe is giving you the chance to start your day with “Once upon a time...” Look at things from a different angle than usual, reading between the lines of whatever people might be telling you. They aren’t trying to pull the wool over your eyes, but chances are you’ll see more if you take the time to look for it.","People may want you to come out and play, so if you can set aside time for that, go for it! Focus on the work in front of you in the early part of the day, plowing through as many tasks as possible, then clock out and link up however you can. It looks like there could be a specific person in particular who wants to spend the evening with you, and dedicating some time to them will be well worth it. Deep bonding is on tonight’s menu.","No matter how organized you are, the chaos of life can still get to you here and there. If things have gotten a bit beyond your control, then allow yourself the day to return to a place of equilibrium. Herd whatever cats you need to -- it’ll be easier than usual to get them together, and you’ll have fewer distractions once that is done. You might even be pleased enough with your progress to call it an early night!","A lot of creative energy is at your fingertips right now. Even if you aren’t someone who normally indulges their artistic side, it would do you a world of good to flex these muscles and see what you can come up with. There’s a well of inspiration within you, and today it’s bubbling up. It’s not trying to get your attention just for fun; rather, you may be able to turn this inspiration into something both useful and special. There’s a masterpiece within you.","Something inside you could be begging for your attention, making things feel rather intense today. But this urge won’t drag you down into the depths -- it will simply ask you to go deeper, like a trained diver probing the still waters far below the moving tides. Take some time to search through the sands of your own metaphorical ocean floor. Any treasures found there are likely to be incredibly meaningful to you, making the venture worth the effort.","You could run into a stumbling block today when it comes to your relationships, be they platonic, professional, or romantic. This isn’t to say that you are going to start locking horns with everyone in your life, but that you need to make a point to be extra clear about what you mean when communicating, and that you shouldn’t assume anything about another person. Unless someone is giving you a crystal-clear explanation, hold off on coming to your own conclusions about anything for now.","Whether you're working today or you have a list of weekend chores to tackle, you may notice that things seem to go much more smoothly than usual. Conversations with the people you interact with are likely to go off without a hitch, and your tasks should be easier to check off. Use this to your advantage and give it your all! You never know when a VIP or supervisor will notice just how well you’re doing, and a financial reward could be forthcoming.","An interesting mix of light-hearted energy and deep efficiency currently fills the air, and while those might seem wildly different, you can actually make great use of this. Dedicate this day to something that fulfills you on a profound, soulful level, preferably something that allows you to express yourself freely while still being useful or self-edifying. Practice makes perfect, so work on improving your skills in something that you already love to do, whatever that might be -- and remember to have fun!","The very cornerstones of your life are coming into focus, revealing just how stable they truly are. You might need to take a closer look at your personal building blocks and size them up; if they aren’t quite as sturdy as you’d thought, then figure out your next steps to bring them up to code. Whether it’s about your relationships, finances, or career, you can do more than just slap on a bandage. This is a great moment to make lasting improvements to your foundation."
2021-05-31,"Our intuition is especially powerful today. As motivator Mars syncs with spiritual Neptune to cast a magical glow over us, our subconscious minds can guide us far along our chosen paths. Things can come together in the easiest of ways, so we have no reason to dread any hard work on the day's agenda. The evening is a great time for us to connect with one another, as the Moon trines communicator Mercury at 7:13 pm EDT and the universe inspires us to share our ideas.","A deep energy fills the day with beautiful nostalgia, helping to alleviate any intense or troubling feelings. You might find there’s more to do around the house than usual -- while you’re tending to these little chores, you could unearth some old memories or forgotten keepsakes, formerly hidden away. Allow yourself to spend some time reminiscing about the past, but stay focused on the good times. There’s no need to rake up negativity if it isn’t going to serve you.","People could bring some truly lovely experiences your way, so don’t shut yourself off from others even if you feel like doing so. An invitation or message may be presented to you, reminding you how much other people care about you and enjoy your presence in their lives. Go ahead and say yes to any opportunities! Even if it doesn’t sound like your thing, you might be pleasantly surprised if it turns out to be right up your alley.","A powerful beam of cosmic vigor is arriving to drive you forward, making today a great day to roll up your sleeves and put in lots of effort. Your work could impact your career in the best way possible. If you’ve been on the lookout for a raise or promotion, this is a good day to bring the subject up with your boss or another VIP. In addition, a mentor might have some words of advice, so don’t be shy about asking.","Firepower is at your fingertips today, and you’ll be itching to put it to good use. If there are any outstanding projects or daunting matters you’ve been putting off, now is the perfect time to tackle them because you’re much more capable than usual. There’s no need to waste time thinking about how to do things, just dive into them! With the stars encouraging you, you could find it’s much easier to accomplish your goals than you ever anticipated.","The stars are sparkling with energy right now, just beyond the periphery of your vision. It’s going to be difficult to grasp the feeling in your hands, but that’s okay. Instead of trying to control it, let it guide you and inspire you. The universe works in mysterious ways, and it’s asking you to take a backseat and follow its lead. You could wind up somewhere truly magical if you remain open to the possibilities, so believe in the impossible.","An altruistic energy is sweeping in to remind you to look out for those less fortunate than yourself. You don’t have to change your entire schedule, but keep your eyes open for little ways to give back. Find some clothes or other items you can offer to a local shelter or search out a good cause to which you could donate a comfortable sum. Consider asking your friends to do the same; contributing together can make a bigger impact than any one person.","A burst of energy is propelling you along your route and could push you forward in your career. You can achieve a lot today, so go ahead and set your sights as high as you dare! That being said, you don’t have to make the journey without a companion at your side. A coworker or client could make your ascent easier, and you’ll have every reason to be grateful to them for it. After all, many hands make light work, so share the work and the success.","This could be one of the loveliest days you’ve had in some time, when things seem to come together as if by magic. If you have responsibilities or chores requiring your attention, do your best to clear them out of the way first thing. Once they’re tidied away, you can focus on all the good things in front of you. Spend time chasing your dreams and putting your desires front and center. They may all be within your grasp, so go on and reach for them.","Some of the most sensitive parts of your chart are going to be impacted by the planets, so take this day one step at a time. Don’t try to rush into anything until you get a proper lay of the land -- that isn’t to say that there will be endless snafus waiting to throw you off your balance, but it would be best to look where you’re going. Take care that you don’t wind up diving headfirst into territory that’s a bit too deep for you.","Working with a partner and trying to make something of yourselves as a team is a terrific idea at the moment. While it’s certainly true that you can accomplish quite a bit on your own, it will be easy to burn out if you force yourself to make a lot of progress without any help. Instead, form a dynamic duo with someone whose skills you trust, knowing that you’ll be able to go much further by going together.","The planets are focused on your money and how you make it today. They’re here to help you cut through any confusing fog and ensure that your finances are working for you, as opposed to sitting in your bank account collecting dust -- or flying back out as soon as you deposit them. If you need to earn extra to make ends meet, a wonderful opportunity could present itself. Even so, simply looking for ways to use your money more efficiently is the wisest course of action.","A magical energy percolates throughout the universe today, and while it’s helping everyone in one way or another, you will benefit more than most. When was the last time you made a wish for what you wanted? Don’t worry too much about reality -- instead, give yourself permission to daydream and focus on the bounty you’d like to obtain. A manifestation exercise, like creating a vision board, could lead you towards clarity about what you want, and help the cosmos bring it to you."
2021-06-01,"We’re in for dreamy adventures today as the universe encourages us to stop and smell the roses. The emotional Moon's trine with harmonious Venus smooths over relationships and helps us speak from the heart, while the Moon entering Pisces allows us to stop obsessing and go with the flow. When the Moon conjuncts lucky Jupiter, we can expect good fortune and cultured conversations. Overindulgence or ignorance of red flags may be a poor side effect of today's energies, but we can utilize our creativity and spirituality in beneficial ways as well.","Support and communication are what’s important to you now in relationships, and you’re likely to find yourself in dreamy conversations with friends and loved ones about love, spirituality, art, and all the things we never say to each other. This can be a somewhat flighty day for you mentally, and you'll find time flies by while you’re having fun. This is also a good time to tune into your creativity in order to help you feel, process, and express your emotions.","Get ready to enjoy your blessings! You have support now to increase your cash flow, and while it's also a great time to save money, you might end up spending it as soon as you get it if you’re not careful. Your friends have gifts to share with you as well. At the very least, someone in your circle may turn you on to a fun new hobby or experience. You can expect to feel more secure now, and this newfound optimism can help you upgrade your life.","You have an urge to be out and about, and this is likely born from a desire to move or to travel after being confined for so long. However, the career you need to fund these ventures might be just out of reach. Now is a good time to market yourself to others, both in the career field and in the romantic arena. If you’re not looking to move on, then you can expect life to feel easier and more lighthearted than normal. Seize the day!","You may be feeling even more reserved and private than usual today -- you’re not looking to broadcast your life for everyone to see, and you might even be more shy with someone you have romantic feelings for. This day is best spent either cozying up by yourself at home or spending some lowkey time in nature with friends or loved ones. The more you go with the flow and trust your intuition, the better you'll feel at the end of the day.","You may be eager to catch up with friends today, but be careful not to spill everything that’s going on with you. If there are opportunities to gossip, don’t take them. It’s best to keep the topics of discussion on subjects that aren’t risky, even though you may feel the temptation to tell what you know. You may also find you don't have as much energy now, especially if you’ve been working overtime, so take care of yourself and take time out to heal if you need it.","Others are noticing your abilities at work and you’re in sync with the people around you today. You’re better able to charm others with your expertise and your ability to take charge, and you may even have an easier time speaking in public. You could find yourself talking to someone more mature than you, either in age or in wisdom, and find that they present you with an opportunity that could help to elevate your life. Embrace this fortune!","An uplifting energy has arrived to support you, but make sure you’re giving yourself the freedom you need to be happy. You relish your space right now, and you’ll want to have fun and live lightheartedly. Others may try to drag you back down to earth, but you’re not willing to give up your ability to spend your time how you want to. Spread your wings and surround yourself with the people who can help you to fly, rather than keep you grounded.","The darker side of conversation is especially appealing now, and you are prone toward obsession or intensity when it comes to the people you’re communicating with. You could scare them away with how strong your feelings are, unless you believe that they feel the same way. In the financial department, you’re able to bring in more money through partnerships or investments now. Let yourself be honest about how you feel, without overpowering the other person, because you’ll end up regretting anything false.","Relationships, both familial and romantic, are highlighted for you today. Perhaps you receive a gift from a family member, or you may learn something that you've never known about your family history that is akin to a valuable treasure. It’s also easier to get a job from home now, or, if you work from home, it should feel easier to do your job. Still, you may find yourself racing to finish work so you can spend time with loved ones. Home is where your heart is.","It seems you've been going through the same old routine lately, but this isn't doing much for your spirit. Today, you’re able to spice up your daily activities with creativity and laughter, and know that it’s okay to. This isn't a time to be restrictive, because if you’re always bottling things up or taking the more difficult route, eventually, you’ll realize you’ve gone way too long without a release. Someone who knows you well, like a sibling or close friend, may be able to help you loosen up.","Money, love, excitement -- it’s all in the cards for you now! Although you might find that you are more sensitive to criticism, there are plenty of opportunities to make the most of this day through monetary gains and luck in charming someone special. You may be your own worst enemy, however, taking yourself out of the game before a winner is even chosen. Instead of giving up before you try, push past the negativity and insist on being a part of the action.","Your biggest challenge today is choosing between all the tempting options for how to spend your time, even if it’s just between the different hobbies that you want to pursue. The universe is supporting you spending quality time with your family or other people you live with, so why not see what they might want to do with you? This will help you to choose which activity you'll enjoy, plus you'll get to spend time with people who love you."
2021-06-02,"A fresh wave of loving and healing energy washes over us today. The sensitive Moon's square to the willful Sun can create discord and emotional blockages that have our hearts and heads battling against each other. However, the Moon's sextile to awakening Uranus encourages emotional change, and we may surprise ourselves with the shifts that are taking place. Once loving Venus enters Cancer at 9:19 am EST, we have both a greater desire and a greater ability to nurture ourselves and our loved ones.","You are blessed with a boost to your self-esteem today, but you're so upbeat that you may be speaking a mile a minute to the people around you. Watch what you say, because you could come off as bragging or even negative. Anything you are feeling right now is likely to fly out of your mouth if you’re not focused on what you're saying. On the bright side, your relationship with your family members is likely to improve now and home can be a place of renewed security and comfort.","You can communicate easily with the people you love today, perhaps after a period of silence. It seems that your mind has been distracted by financial matters, but it’s now shifting to your support group and how you interact with them. If you’ve been nose-deep in your work lately, it’s time to lift your head and reconnect. You don’t necessarily have to spend time in the same room with someone, just a phone call can brighten up the day for both of you.","It is becoming apparent that the life you desire for yourself requires a more solid financial foundation. You've had some time to focus on yourself and your needs, but now that focus is shifting toward money matters. While you’re still able to express yourself and live freely, you’re aware that it’s hard to live life the way you want to without money. You may feel torn between choosing rebellion or security right now, but in the end, choose what will benefit your future self.","There's a sparkle in your eye as beautiful Venus moves into your sign, and you're like a magnet to others now. While you may be hesitant to move on from things that you’re familiar with, it’s time to make a change; it's time to see yourself as important -- just as important as the people you sacrifice so much for. When you’re able to receive just as easily as you give, you create a better flow of love in your life. Don’t block your blessings!","A decision stands before you and it’s important to take some time to yourself before making any decisions today -- don’t let peer pressure take you somewhere you don’t want to go. If you’re willing to embrace the mystery, then letting yourself be whisked off into the unknown can be fun. However, if you’re feeling more like spending quiet time at home to process things, trust that feeling. Let your intuition be your guide, especially when others think they have a say.","It seems you've been so hyper-focused on your job lately that you haven't realized you have been neglecting your friends. This is a beautiful time to reach out, as friendships are more likely to bloom now -- just make sure that you’re nurturing the relationships that you really want to be a part of. A certain friend may also try to become more than friends, so unless that's something you’re looking for, you may want to steer toward other friendships.","Luck is on your side! Today you are able to create your own luck without much effort, as long as you come from a place of pure intentions. Being manipulative or passive-aggressive will not benefit you whatsoever -- you’ll have an easier time being honest with the people around you, even if you’re in conflict at the time. You may feel pressured to conform by somebody who is especially traditional, but it’s up to you whether you want to stick to the old ways or try something new.","You’re ready to move on from old situations that no longer serve you, even though your heart may feel trapped in the past. Old relationships and friendships must be let go of in order to make space for the future people who will enter your life -- especially the ones who promise you they’ll change, but never do. You may have entertained these situations for too long, but now they’re ready to be set free. Expand your mind and dream bigger for yourself.","You may have been avoiding a tough situation with someone in your life, but now you’re wanting to repair the relationship in some way. The best way to honor yourself is to be truthful and tell them how you really feel. Dancing around the truth won’t let you get to the freeing, emotional place that you want to be. It seems this may be an issue of family versus friends, so make sure that you handle it with care for everyone involved.","What you’re saying and what you’re doing may not be in alignment, and you might not even know it! Take a step back and look at what you say you want out of life. If your current actions don’t take you toward those goals, then it’s time to figure out what you can change in your regular routine that will make you feel more ready to take these steps. Your friends will support you, but you have to speak up for yourself so they know where to step in.","Although you're not usually one to be tied down, it's important that you focus on creating a routine for yourself now that will keep you from floating around aimlessly, wasting important time and energy. You may find that your financial situation is directly tied to your emotional state today, so it’s worth it to find your zen before you face the day. The more calm and focused you are under pressure, the better you will end the day.","The current you and the past you are at odds right now, especially the parts of your personality that you inherited from people in your youth. We all have to decide what to hang on to and what to leave behind, and our personal habits are included in that. If you learned negative self-talk or procrastination from someone you admire, then it’s worth it to take some small steps to remedy that. Ask yourself who you want to be, then do what you can to embody that person."
2021-06-03,"An emotional rollercoaster awaits us all, but we’ll be in a better place once we leave the ride! The moody Moon is all over the place today, making several aspects and encouraging erratic emotional responses. Once the confident Sun trines disciplined Saturn, we'll be able to take serious steps towards security -- if we can stay focused through the hiccups. Finally, luxurious Venus trines expansive Jupiter at 7:33 pm EDT, capping off the day with optimism by bringing luck in love and money.","Your luck is most likely to arrive in the form of protection and sensitivity to your needs, which could come from your family or roommates. Whoever you trust when you need aid will bring blessings to your life, but you may still experience emotional outbursts today. Be considerate of others’ feelings and don’t abuse their patience, because there is the temptation to make it all about you. The more thoughtful you are, no matter how difficult that may be at times, the better you’ll feel in hindsight.","Fears and worries will try to take over today, but what’s the benefit in letting that happen? You’ll receive helpful advice and opportunities from your friends about this matter, and if you have siblings, they may be of extra support. Networking and helping others to feel heard is a great way to channel your energy and stop imposter syndrome in its tracks. When your worries pop up, let them know they’re not welcome here, and don’t let them hold you back from what you really want in life.","Your feelings may be tied up in what your friends or society at large thinks about you today. Society often encourages us to live our lives according to how others perceive us, but if someone insists that you should stop doing something that makes you happy, re-evaluate whether or not they’re concerned about you or trying to control you. If they’re genuinely concerned, it’s OK to gently correct them or take their advice into consideration. If they’re being controlling, let it go in one ear and out the other.","Today you'll have the opportunity to expand your horizons and spread your wings in ways you weren't able to before. Business partnerships and positive relationships in the workplace are benefitting you and preventing you from settling for something less than what you really want. You may find that others encourage you more now, even to move on from the job or the town you live in. Instead of taking this as a desire for you to leave, accept that they see you doing bigger and better things.","Today there could be a show of commitment in a relationship where there was uncertainty before. However, as soon as you receive this commitment, you may worry that it isn’t the right path for you. If someone doesn’t show you the respect that you deserve regarding your boundaries or your privacy, then they may not deserve what they’re asking you for. It’s important to sleep on any decisions before making them and to ensure that others know your limits are important to you.","Birds of a feather should flock together today! It’s important to be with people who understand you, because spending time with those who don’t get you can be disheartening and will block you from the blessings that are rightfully yours. Any new connections you make now are more likely to stick around, and the close friends who know you well will help you manifest wonderful opportunities in your life. It's a treasure to have a tribe that elevates your life in magnificent ways.","You’re creating more stability in your life, but you might feel wishy-washy about the way you want to do this today. Do you want to work out, balance your checkbook, or reorganize your house? Don’t get hung up on making the perfect decision, because this can put you in a spin and keep you from making the progress you want to. Simply picking a task and going after it while avoiding any drama will put you on the road to success.","It's possible you'll feel indecisive about going after work or play today, and it’s up to you to do what's best for you. You may have been stuck in one extreme or the other, spending all your time avoiding difficult tasks or putting all your focus into work. If there has been an imbalance, it will make itself known now. Once you can see which side of the issue needs to be improved, you’ll have to make an effort to bring things back to center.","You won't be interested in people who aren’t serious about you, because you’re craving the feeling of belonging and sincerity. Those who can’t be honest with you, especially those who lie to make themselves look better, will fall flat for you now. While the people who say yes to everything may be fine as acquaintances, the people who are truly close to you have to be dependable to gain your loyalty. Speak your mind today and only stick with the people who tell you what you need to hear.","Past memories are likely to be cropping up for you today, evoking nostalgia for the good times and mournfulness for the rough times. It’s okay to let them hold the space that they deserve in your heart, but don’t let bad memories play on a loop and keep you trapped in that former place. Similarly, don’t let good ones keep you yearning for a time that is no longer anywhere to be found. Instead, do your best to seize the present.","Your greatest blessings will arrive from your own efforts and communication skills today, so don’t let this time slip away! You may find that all your feelings are verbally spilling out now, but make sure you’re speaking from your heart and not simply reacting to what people are presenting to you. Sometimes we have a different perspective once we’re past the initial moment, so take a deep breath and think before responding. Considering the other person's feelings before giving advice will help you avoid conflict.","Your self-esteem might be on shaky ground under the current planetary energy, so spend some time hyping yourself up today. Ironically, others are more aware of your worth, and while this can be a good thing when it’s people who support you, it can be difficult when it’s someone who feels threatened by you. Realize that the tension between you and another person could be a sign of jealousy. Try to talk it out with humility, but if you can’t, remember that you don’t need to prove yourself."
2021-06-04,"We are torn today between allowing ourselves to shine without fear of criticism or hiding away to work in secret. There are pros and cons to both, and we’ll see them both in our opportunities today. The emotional Moon's sextile to serious Saturn can pull us in the direction of more isolating activities, while the Moon's sextile to the self-assured Sun is looking for the spotlight. Now is the time to work on whatever gives us purpose, finding balance through a blend of humility and confidence.","You can get by with a little help from your friends today. In fact, friends, siblings, and even coworkers are willing to support you in your efforts if you’ve ended up with too much on your plate. At the same time, you may feel especially sensitive to the opinions of others, so try not to jump to conclusions if someone’s words rub you the wrong way. Collaboration is helpful to you now -- embrace the teamwork!","Security is very important to you now, and you’ll be playing your cards close to the chest while you decipher your feelings regarding trust. It'll be all too easy to get lost in your thoughts if you’re just sitting around, but focusing on work or hobbies can help you get out of your head. Work in an intuitive way rather than trying to do everything by the book, though, because doing things the regular old way may cause you unexpected roadblocks. New paths lead to new destinations.","Though you may feel compelled to play a role at work or at school, it's important that you be yourself and really mean it. Individuality can feel like a burden sometimes, but you’re meant to enjoy the person you are rather than wishing you could blend into the crowd. Spend a quiet moment alone and ask yourself how you would express yourself if you had no limits. Afterward, see what you can do to create this in reality, even in a small way. Make room for the real, true you.","You may feel torn today between wanting to take the credit for all your hard work and wanting to simply move in silence. Ultimately, it’s not a good time to be spreading your business to everyone, as gossip or jealousy can creep in and create problems for you in the long run. You’re also more sensitive now when it comes to what you contribute to the world, so any harsh criticism of your work could be hurtful. Understand that, as long as it’s worth it to YOU, it’s worth it.","Friends are coming out of the woodwork and you're eager to spend some time with the solid people in your life. Drudge work and climbing the corporate ladder are not your priorities right now -- this is a time to revel in friendship and to learn from the people around you. While this isn’t an invitation to shirk your responsibilities, don’t feel as if you have to work all day and night. Who you know is more important than what you know, especially now!","It’s time to get all your ducks in a row, Virgo. You may find yourself under some scrutiny now, and an organized home and workspace will help you to tackle the tasks ahead of you. The more you can prepare your space, schedule, and mood, the better, because being prepared really can help you in all areas of life right now. You may even find yourself being recognized at work by your superiors, so be on your toes and rewards may follow!","Amicable as ever, you’re fine letting others take the reins now -- just make sure you’re handing them over to the right person! You’re ready to see some new sights and experience new activities, but may not be sure where you want to go. Luckily, someone could present you with the perfect opportunity today. Don't feel like you have to call the shots, because odds are, they want someone to share in their own newfound interest. Let your sense of adventure connect you with the people who love you.","Your body is trying to tell you something, so listen to its call; sleep when you're tired, eat when you're hungry, walk when you're restless. The more you heed your body, the better you will feel overall, so avoid pushing yourself when it's telling you to take a break. You are standing on your own two feet now, but with more independence comes more responsibility. Treat your body and mind with respect and they will respect you back!","Business and pleasure mix easily today. People around you seem more lighthearted and fun, and even your grumpiest coworkers are willing to crack a smile. Keep up the energy around you if possible, because everything will flow more smoothly with a dash of humor. If someone tries to kill the mood, shrug and move on. Your personal relationships can also bloom with gentle grace now, so sharing time with a special friend or loved one could be just what you both need.","Your hard work is finally paying off! The projects you've devoted yourself to may start to show growth, helping you feel secure in your abilities to reach your desired result. Satisfaction and self-esteem are both categories that you're going to see improvement in now, so don't give up on what you've been working toward! You can receive emotional support from your mother or another maternal figure in your life, and this will help you to reach a place of greater security.","Your mind is buzzing with ideas and stories you want to tell your friends and family, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to share today. The children in your life may especially bring a smile to your face, or this uplift could come from a creative source instead. Embracing an attitude of openness and fun will bring unexpected gains, so don't get hung up on finding the right way to do things. As always, the journey is as important as the destination.","A refreshed sense of emotional security and belonging are helping you to put old fears to rest. You have likely been doing some of the emotional heavy lifting for other people in your life lately, and you're ready to distance yourself from these unbalanced relationships. It's easier to be grounded right now, but this grounded energy is rooted in you trusting yourself. The more you trust yourself, the more others will show you the same level of trust."
2021-06-05,"Saying and doing are sometimes worlds apart, and it’s our job to bridge the gap between promises and results. The emotional Moon's sextile to communicative Mercury helps our words flow with feeling, but Mercury's square to confusing Neptune may cause us to overestimate our abilities. The opposition between brash Mars and controlling Pluto highlights the flaws in our plans and can cause mishaps, and the Moon's later squares to both Pluto and Mars could have us throwing in the towel. Remember, it’s not the end, it’s only a setback!","Your work is looking chaotic today, so take a deep breath before you begin and remind yourself that you can handle anything life throws at you. This can manifest as anything from a migraine to a disgruntled customer to a wrong turn that causes you to be a few minutes late. On top of that, you're more likely to take things personally now or get down on yourself for things that couldn't be avoided. Give yourself and others grace -- we all need a little room for error today.","It is difficult to determine fact from fiction today, especially when it comes to what people say to you -- the truth is hard to come by. Take any gossip that you hear today with a grain of salt, and don't let others hurt you with words. Chances are, your intuition and a close eye on past actions will help you to sort out reality from the words that are being said, which are only meant to cause a disruption. Take the high road.","If you're not paying attention to what you're saying, you could end up putting your foot in your mouth! You may find yourself speaking up out of obsession or fear today, especially in matters regarding yourself and your financial situation. Try not to pile your frustrations and worries onto the people around you, because the things you say now have the potential to start a chain reaction. Use your words with clarity and kindness and you’ll end any issues before they begin.","Your mind is on your money, but someone else's mind is on you. Unfortunately, this person may not have your best interests at heart, so you need to keep your plans and projects to yourself now. Especially if you're planning to change jobs soon, make sure you're not telling just anyone who will listen. It’s important that you be honest with yourself about the people around you, so if there’s someone who has tried to sabotage you in the past, make sure they aren’t privy to your plans now.","Freedom seems to be just out of reach -- right when you’re reaching for it most. Unexpected issues at work or with authority figures can create frustration, and you may feel like running away from it all. However, know that this stress will pass and that the upsets to your routine are temporary. Plan some time to destress later on and to talk through the crazy events of the day with a friend, as long as they’re in the right place to support you. Reciprocate if you can!","While interactions with business partners and coworkers will be moving along smoothly today, you’re likely to experience some turbulence in your interpersonal relationships. If there are children in your life, prepare for them to create chaos in your schedule. Plans with friends or within your community may be thrown off by a variety of interruptions, so if there’s a lot riding on these plans, make sure you have a Plan B. A little preparedness can turn a setback into an opportunity.","Family is a blessing, but sometimes they drive us crazy, and this could easily be one of those times. Egotistical or toxically positive family members might insert their opinions today where they don’t belong, and it may be difficult to draw boundaries that they will be able to understand. Communicating these boundaries could end up creating more issues between you, but whether they understand your reasons or not, remember that if you’re not comfortable, you don’t have to budge.","Miscommunication and arguments are potential pitfalls for you today, so watch what you say and who you say it to. If you can feel your blood boiling while someone says something that rubs you the wrong way, try to count to ten before you verbally erupt. You’re quick to retaliate with words, but today this will only add fuel to the fire. Issues are especially likely to arise if you are traveling in any way, so remember to move with intent and patience.","Some surprises are good, but financial surprises may throw you for a loop today. Rising costs and hidden charges can drain you if you’re not paying attention to what’s going in and out of your reserves. It’s not a good time to invest or to make other financial decisions, because they’re likely to be more trouble than they’re worth. Diligence is your best friend now, so don’t slack on the details. If you do run into trouble, a close partner or friend can help you figure out the issues.","Life at home may feel stressful today due to issues in a romantic relationship or with your close friends. Controlling or demanding people may cause you to doubt yourself and what you want to do with your life, and their intense desires can create frustration for you. Make it known if someone is pushing you around too much, because life is about give and take. If you’re doing all the giving and they’re doing all the taking, even if you love them, it’s time to be clear.","You have an expressive edge now, which is a good thing, but it also makes it easier to blurt out something you wish you could take back. You can be especially triggered by words today, and those who know how to push your buttons may try to goad you into verbally fighting back. Instead of taking the bait, let them know that you don’t agree and show them that their statements don't affect you. Above all, keep your cool.","You could find yourself in the middle of some emotional outbursts today, and may see friends falling out with each other. Whether it's a minor disagreement or a major argument, there comes a point where they try to get you to pick a side. If there’s someone who’s clearly in the right, then it’s alright to side with that person, but if it’s vague and really none of your business, then you’re perfectly within your rights to stay out of it. A friend who cares about you will understand."
2021-06-06,"There's beauty, love, and pleasure all around us today. The sensitive Moon enters sweet and serene Taurus at 1:46 am EDT, taking us out of the recent turbulence and creating a more stable emotional environment. The Moon's sextile to expansive Jupiter then helps us to feel luckier and more optimistic, while her sextile to loving Venus creates harmony in our connections with friends and loved ones, and may even spark a new connection. The sky is aglow as a fresh, hopeful phase is dawning!","There's a lot of support for you today if you need it; let your intuition and the nurturing family members that you trust be your guides. Financial issues that have been plaguing you seem to be fading out of sight, but there may still be some bumps in the road at work. This is a great day to spend at home, relaxing with the people who love you and who have always been there for you. Embrace harmony and abundance -- they're ready to embrace you!","You’re shining today, and your natural state of being is charismatic and alluring to the people around you. Let your loved ones give you the encouragement that you need to be your best self! However, you may also feel sensitive or impulsive at this time, and others may indulge you without thinking about what you really need. Make sure that ""yes-people"" don’t convince you that you can do no wrong. Keep your ego in check and it’s bound to be a fun day!","Professional triumphs and financial increases could make themselves known to you today, and you'll want to shout out your successes to everyone around you. However, you’ll enjoy better luck if you’re able to keep things secret. Knowing that you kept this moment to yourself and that you savored it before you let the whole world see will make it sweeter in the long run. Let yourself be mysterious for now and everything will ultimately fall into place.",You have an upbeat day in store and it's a great time to socialize with the people who get you. You may really be in the mood to cut loose and let any old insecurities disappear into the past where they belong. Any issues that arise are likely to come from people who are actively trying to control your self-expression and don’t want to see you having more fun than they are. Don’t let any negative attitudes discourage you from embracing your freedom!,"Whether you know it or not, people are watching your progress in the workplace, and they seem to be impressed with what they’re seeing! It's possible you are keeping guard around your heart now, and it’s okay to be protective when you’ve been hurt before. However, make sure that this protective layer isn’t born out of imposter syndrome or insecurity, because you can close yourself off from opportunities when you’re avoiding connecting with others. When others reach out to you today, try to meet them halfway.","Your faith in other people is being restored and you may be ready to put yourself out there. If you’ve been holding back with a new group of friends or another new person in your life, now is the time to bloom and let them take a glimpse of who you really are inside. Don’t feel like you have to be the perfect person -- this can come off as false or condescending. Just be yourself, and you'll know that people are interested in the real you.","You have the power to command respect from others now, so use it wisely! Someone looks up to you, whether you’re aware of it or not, and they may be basing their actions on what matters to you. While it’s not your responsibility to be the perfect role model, try to be kind to those who are less experienced or younger than you. Remember what it was like when you were in their position and be forgiving if they’re not catching up with you quite yet.","Relationships are highlighted for you and you may find that any issues you’ve been having with people you care about are no longer as pressing. Your passion for life is stronger now, and a number of opportunities may arise for joint creative pursuits or just fun times with friends. While the enthusiasm is wonderful, do make sure that you’re not scattering your energy trying to please or impress others. Don’t end the day without doing something just for yourself!","You may find it difficult to share what's in your heart now, but family and trusted friends can help you to open up again. Healing may come to you through kind words and support from the people who have been there for you when no one else was. You are drawn more toward connections that have intimacy and depth at this time, as well as more intense or mysterious conversations. Leave the small talk behind and find someone that you can discuss the deeper side of life with.","Perseverance and determination are great qualities to have, but they aren’t necessary for every good thing in life. In fact, you can sometimes block yourself from doing what you love, either because you think you don’t deserve what you really want, or you may think that you have to struggle in order to do something meaningful. Today, make a point to do something low maintenance and relaxing with someone you love, and let life be easy for once!","Home is where your heart is right now, so it's worth paying attention to the energy in your living space. Tidy things up and open the windows to let in the fresh air, because a clean space will help positive energy flow. Work may also be easier for you now, and people who often make you work for their approval are more inclined to give it to you without as much effort. Don't fight these currents -- let the good things in life flow to you!","Who you know can make a difference. Even if you’re a shy person naturally, today you’ll notice that it’s easier to hold a conversation with others and also easier to connect on a mental level. People who often misunderstand you may now listen and see where you’re coming from; just make sure that you’re not only talking to hear yourself speak. Really listen when it’s your turn to do so, because all this talk could amount to a positive opportunity for you!"
2021-06-07,"We should expect the unexpected and resist forcing what isn’t working today. The sensitive Moon conjuncts erratic Uranus at 3:39 am EDT, creating unexpected emotions and rapidly changing viewpoints. Soon after, the Moon’s square to critical Saturn can cause pessimistic attitudes, making responsibilities feel more burdensome or difficult to change. We can be our own worst enemies with the critical eye and hectic pace of our inner thoughts. This is a day for finding our zen and avoiding feeling guilty over what we can’t control.","You might have recently discovered an offbeat way of bringing in money or found an unusual activity that boosts your self-esteem, but your friends may not understand this new source of abundance for you. They could be confused or have some concerns -- or just nosy questions. Don’t feel that you have to explain yourself to anyone today. If it brings you joy and isn’t harming you or anyone else, then there’s no reason that you should have to eliminate this new positive influence on your life.","There may be chaos in your workplace today, and it’s possible some of it will come from you. You may be trying to make too many changes, or your brain might be scattered across several projects at once. Make sure these rebellious ideas for switching things up and the unpredictable methods of doing your work aren’t causing others to fall behind. However, if your ideas really work and aren’t throwing others off their rhythm, then feel free to be as different as you want to be now!","Your intuition feels at odds with your beliefs today, and it can be hard to let go of something that you’ve held onto for so long. However, when what you need to know is in front of you, there’s nothing to do but change your initial thesis. While this doesn’t mean throwing away everything you believe in, what you learn now could challenge an idea you thought was dependable. Instead of holding tight to the past, let what you’ve learned slowly sink in.","Friends are bringing change into the picture, and this could be anything from a new hangout spot to a new member of the group -- but this may not sit right with you today. You’re clinging to what's familiar, but sometimes you have to make compromises for the greater good. If you’ve been feeling like you’re going in different directions, this may be where you split. However, if you’re willing to forgo tradition in order to embrace growth with your favorite people, then let changes come naturally.","Work relationships are fluctuating today, and people that were once enemies may become friends or vice versa. This could be about the relationships you have with your coworkers, or it could be the relationships your coworkers have with each other. Either way, feelings are shifting like sand. You may want your work family to stay together, but inconvenient circumstances or hurt feelings can make it too difficult to keep it going. Embrace it, and try not to force people back together when they’re trying to heal.","Your mind is working at a million miles an hour today, and you may find that you’re jumping to conclusions far faster than you’re finding evidence to support said conclusions. It's easy to get caught up in your thoughts and create mental scenarios right now, but it would benefit you not to dwell on any that are negative or vengeful. Instead of trying to retaliate against the people that you feel slighted by, wait until tomorrow to see if you still feel the same way.","There is a high likelihood that a surprise responsibility will force you to delay any relaxing plans you had for the day. If you have the day off, you may get called in to handle a work issue, or someone in your family might require your assistance at the last minute. It's also possible that someone wants to cash in a favor from you, and it would be difficult to avoid helping without disrupting a balance in your relationship. Doing the right thing will help everyone involved!","If someone around you is behaving inconsistently, it might be hard to understand their feelings. Trying to read their mind won’t work, so go ahead and ask them what’s going on today. If they still won’t tell you, then you’re either not responsible for how they’re acting, or they’re unwilling to face up to the issues and try to resolve them maturely. Either way, the onus is on them to let you know what’s going on if something is bothering them.","Your routine is unpredictable under the current planetary energy, and you might feel like complaining and ranting rather than trying to move forward. While venting is understandable, make sure you’re not venting to the point where you’re creating new problems for yourself. Sometimes the energy we put into expressing our frustration when things aren’t working can be better spent on picking up and moving on. Allow yourself to skip parts of your routine today -- it might make things easier in the long run.","Money matters could be problematic right now, and it’s not a good day to make large or impulsive purchases. Going online shopping where temptations run rampant might be a dangerous decision for your bank account, and you may realize that you didn’t want that thing after you bought it. It’s OK to go window shopping or create a wishlist -- but if you click that purchase button without a budget in mind, you might be sending it right back for a refund!","Unexpected events at home today may cause you to be critical with yourself and others. This could manifest as broken household items, forgotten important chores, or a ruckus when you said you needed peace and quiet. Take a deep breath and try to communicate your feelings to your housemates calmly. If they’re unwilling to see your point of view, especially if this is a recurring issue, you may want to have a serious talk about what you expect from the people sharing your living space.","Fears could creep in and keep you from moving forward with something that you were really excited about recently. While you could come up with a million reasons not to do something, why not try and remember what attracted you to this in the first place? How did you feel when you started -- or even before you started -- and how would you feel if you succeeded? Getting back into a confident headspace today can shake off those clinging doubts and force them out of your head."
2021-06-08,"Powerful emotions and desires emerge today and we can choose to either indulge them or restrain them. As the emotional Moon trines deep-delving Pluto at 7:30 am EDT, we aren’t satisfied with the surface topics. The Moon's sextile to assertive Mars then adds a sense of boldness to our energy. However, once Luna squares off with expansive Jupiter this evening, we could end up going too far with these intense feelings. Find the line between being inquisitive and being respectful.","Your family may be over the top right now, but you don’t have to get sucked into their drama. Even though the intensity that your family members or roommates are bringing to your life is intriguing, you know you’re at risk of becoming a player in this game that has nothing to do with you. Once you know their secrets and grudges, they belong to you a little bit, so either keep your hands clean or find a way to keep it private.","It could feel like friends from both near and far have an opinion on what you should be doing with your life, but only you know what is best for you. As you’re pulled in several directions at once, you might have to pull back if you don’t want to get caught up in a tornado of other people’s agendas. Reading a book or watching a movie that you felt connected to in the past can help you to reconnect with your own energy.","Work could take over both your schedule and your mind today. You may struggle to keep up with your own needs as you deal with the responsibilities that have been placed on you by your superiors or your business partner. While all this grinding could be financially beneficial for you, you may end up forgetting to eat or sleep! Prioritize your health and make sure that you aren't the last person on your list of people to take care of. You really can’t pour from an empty cup.","It's important that you recognize your limits before you end up barreling past them. You have your eyes on the prize, but using all your energy and resources now will have you burning out in the near future. Instead of pushing yourself harder or committing to responsibilities that you’re not necessarily ready for, recognize which bite-sized chunks of work you can do today and come up with a manageable list of more chunks to complete tomorrow. Success comes through a series of small steps.","Recent changes to your routine may have caused some ripple effects, and not all of them are easy to adjust to. There’s more on your plate, which means more rewards for all your efforts, but your efforts have had to increase, too. Others are likely impressed with your dedication, but make sure that you’re not driving yourself into a tizzy with stress. If you need someone to talk to or to let off some steam with, reach out to someone who supports you.","Deeper and more piercing conversation topics may be especially enticing to you now, and you’re eager to ask questions and learn more about some people in your life. Sensuality is also more powerful, and someone in your group of friends might have some juicy information regarding love and lust. Before you get into any conversations, commit to yourself to being a good friend and a great secret-keeper, or else these fun stories could turn into a headache, quickly!","You’re enveloped in the big picture, which means the little things can easily slip right out of your focus and create havoc that you don't need right now. Scatterbrained actions are likely, but if you are prepared, you can minimize the distractions and detours and still come out on top. Keep a checklist with you and set alarms on your phone so you don't miss anything important. When your mind starts wandering, just keep bringing it back to center.","You may really be in a mood to ask intense questions about other people's lives today. You sign naturally likes to get to the bottom of things, so if something piques your interest, you won’t want to let it go. Still, even though you may love to know all the gory details and you're comfortable with your shadow side, not everyone is. Make sure that you don’t push people too far to where they feel uncomfortable sharing their secrets.","Overindulging your family or the people you live with could drain you if you’re not aware of how it’s affecting you. Whether it's loaning them money that you can’t really spare or spending the day catering to their desires when you have other plans, make sure that you’re not bending over backward in ways that are hurting you. You have your own ideas for how today will go. It's okay to gently let people know that you need a day to handle your own business.","You may be reorganizing your life after some unexpected emotional turbulence, and now people could start asking for updates on your situation. You’re welcome to share what you feel comfortable sharing, but remember that some people only ask how you’re doing because they want the inside scoop on what’s happening in your life. Be discerning when you’re sharing the more intimate details of your circumstances, because when your information is out there, others can twist words and sensationalize normal actions. Control your own narrative!","You're probably ready to let loose and have some fun after being so focused on the other people in your life lately. Unfortunately, work can get in the way of your carefree attitude, and you might be tempted to rush through it and snap at anybody who tries to slow you down. Instead of blowing up, take the pace down a notch so that you don’t have to go back and redo what you’ve already done. The fun will still be waiting for you at the end.","You could have a lot that you want to share today, but make sure the people you're talking to are in the right space to hear what you have to say. Your emotions and perspectives are more intense and you may overload others with all the thoughts you’re bursting with. Even though your experiences are valid and important, everyone is going through something of their own. Gently wade into these topics if they’re emotionally heavy, and allow space for others to share."
2021-06-09,"Our emotional stability and inner sense of responsibility are especially highlighted today. The universe is fairly quiet, save for the introspective Moon's trine to responsible Saturn. This positive connection encourages us all to get serious and to be the person that we’re scared to try and be. Imposter syndrome and self-doubt are our biggest pitfalls, but it may help to read about the early days of someone who’s successful now. It's time we put our doubts to rest and power through our fears, right into greatness.","Your tongue could either land you in trouble today or get you out of a tough situation -- the key to creating a positive outcome will be forethought. Don’t speak without thinking about what you’re about to say, because just saying anything that pops into your head will probably make you wish you hadn’t said anything at all. The good news is, this is a wonderful day to make plans with others and to try to solidify some loose ideas that have been on your mind.","You could achieve what you want with relative ease now, as long as you focus on the future rather than the past. Your self-esteem receives a boost today, and people may praise your ability to go onward and upward. All this praise can go to your head, but don’t forget everything you put into your accomplishments! Others don’t see all the hard, behind-the-scenes work that goes into creating your success, but you know what it took. Don’t get complacent unless you want to stop growing.","Your head may be in the clouds today, so try not to make them rainclouds! You could get swept away with daydreaming or planning for the future, but you could also fall into a pit of worry that prevents you from doing what you really want to be doing. Don’t be so stressed out by time passing that you sit and worry rather than seizing the day. Even if it’s only for ten minutes, do something that makes you feel like you’ve accomplished something positive for yourself.","Engaging in risky behavior or pushing your body to the limit may be catching up to you. If you’ve been skipping sleep in favor of work or fun, it’s time to get that much-needed rest you owe yourself. It may be hard to tell how you really feel right now, and it’ll be easy to trick yourself into thinking you can do more than you actually can. Self-care is instrumental for your success, so ask for space to breathe if you need it.","Someone may ask for your help today and you'd be wise to offer support, because you could be asking for a return on that favor sooner rather than later. Either way, two heads are probably better than one in this case. What you consider to be your weaknesses are other people's strengths, and vice versa, making it much easier to make positive progress when you have someone to support your efforts. Be a reliable friend when the call comes.","Honesty and integrity are important concepts right now, and you may be more aware of your reputation than ever. If you’ve been dishonest or evasive with the people in your life, you could find it easier to let go of these behaviors and start anew. If you’ve always acted with integrity, then you are likely to reap the benefits of your actions, particularly through networking or your career. While being your best self is always encouraged, it’s really worth it to put your best foot forward today.","The world is pulling at you in a strong way, and you may find yourself dreaming of adventure in a country you haven’t visited, food you haven’t tried, and things you haven’t learned about. Turn these dreams into a vision board today and spend some time thinking of how to make them happen; you may also benefit from involving friends or a partner. Set up a small fund and promise that you won’t touch the money until you have enough to check an item off your bucket list!","You may find yourself thinking seriously about the future and what will happen when you’re older, perhaps inspired by someone older in your life. This is a good time to set up trust funds or savings accounts to feel prepared -- anything that helps you put down roots and create security. In an emotional sense, you may also want to share with the people closest with you and build stronger, more intimate bonds. Do what makes you feel safe, yet helps you grow.","The relationships between people in different spheres of your life may be colliding in ways that you weren’t expecting. Thankfully, this is likely to be a good thing, and you can expect them to be more willing to get along now if they haven’t in the past. It seems everyone wants to be more mature in their interactions with you, and you may be acting more mature as well. You're realizing the benefits of trading drama for peace.","It's time to tighten up wherever you have gotten lax, and luckily, you’re probably filled with more ambition than you’ve felt in a while. You have a much keener eye for what needs fixing now, like a haze has just been lifted. Once you’ve done some fine-tuning around the house or on a current project, finish that book you've been reading or call back the doctor. You don’t always have this laser-sharp focus on improvement, so take advantage of this energy and level yourself up!","You're probably getting tired of everything feeling so serious, and may be eager to do what it takes to shake everyone out of their funks. You're not about shirking your work -- you're willing to work hard, but now you want to play hard too. Get whatever work you have out of the way, then afterward, remove yourself and commit to not thinking or talking about it until tomorrow. Go ahead and cut loose, just keep moderation in mind!","The structures that you’re used to relying on may be dissolving a little, leaving you to build back up the spaces that are left behind. This is a good thing, because you can rebuild them in a way that’s more tailor-made for you, which will help you become the person that you want to be. These structures likely involve your family or your home, so try to be kind to the people closest to you, as they may be adjusting to these changes as well."
2021-06-10,"We’re adjusting to big changes in our everyday lives. The Solar Eclipse in adaptable Gemini at 6:53 am EDT sets the tone for the day, insisting that we find different solutions and new ways of living life, or risk being left behind. The sensitive Moon's conjunction with intellectual Mercury creates inquisitiveness but also deception, and the Moon's square to confusing Neptune only heightens illusions -- don’t be sold a lie. The day ends with the confident Sun's conjunction with Mercury, which sheds light on our words, so speak with truth.","Your fears and worries can be your biggest pitfall now, so don’t let yourself slip in! Sometimes it can almost feel comforting to give in to thinking the worst might happen, because it takes the pressure off of you needing to succeed. You might even feel like you’re in the way of someone else’s success right now, but ask yourself why you feel like you don’t deserve it. It’s not advised to make any big moves under today's Solar Eclipse, but get back out there with confidence tomorrow!","There's an extra focus on your bank account now and the financial relationship that you have with other people. You may be relying on your money to help you buy friends, or you may wish that you had enough to impress everyone around you. Instead of flashing what you have or mourning what you don’t have, appreciate the people who don’t care whether you’re raking it in or not. Give love back to those who give it to you without the superficial expectations.","Your emotions may be all over the place today, and this internal rollercoaster can make it difficult to realize how you’re appearing to everyone else. Emotional outbursts could happen at any moment, and you may feel like running away from your responsibilities rather than facing them head on. Now is not a good time to debut something that you’ve created, because it’s harder to have an objective opinion on its quality. Get a second opinion before you put yourself out there.","Pain that's been holding you back is ready to be let go of ... once you’ve unlocked the cage around your inner self. Holding a grudge really only hurts you, but even though you know this, it can feel like an old emotional wound is stuck on you for good. Instead of trying to continue ignoring its influence, do what you can to heal it now. Just keep in mind that you should only cut someone off under a Solar Eclipse if you truly don’t want them back.","Friendships that are not nurturing you are coming into focus now, and it’s up to you to decide whether or not broken bonds can be healed. Someone may be trying to control you in ways that you know you could never and would never allow. Infringing on your personal freedom or trying to embarrass you in order to put you in your place will never be acceptable, and it’s not worth it to let this behavior slip.","Your career is being highlighted now more than ever, but it may be throwing a lot at you at once. There could be chaos in the workplace, but this is a chance for you to prove your ability to come through in a pinch and be the reliable person saving the day. Someone may also leave out the details when explaining something to you, and whether or not they're doing it maliciously, it sets you back to not have this knowledge. Asking for clarification could save you some hassle!","You have a lot of support right now in dissolving negative habits, especially if you’ve been noticing the hours are passing you by lately. If you’ve been partying too hard or distracting yourself with games or movies, it’s time to come down to earth. Give yourself a moment to detox from all the noise, because these behaviors are distracting you from what’s really going on around you. Center yourself and break through the mind-numbing activities that aren't taking you anywhere.","You may feel forced to let go of something that you once shared with someone else, and although you don’t want to set it free, this is instrumental to your personal growth. It’s easier to let go of old obsessions right now, and you’re more able to trust yourself with letting go, where before you might have been too afraid to move on. Acknowledge that you’re not the same person you were when you shared this connection -- you’re ready for the next stage of life.","Today's Solar Eclipse has its sights set on your interpersonal relationships, and it's scrutinizing which ones are working and which ones are damaging. Family members, close friends, fierce enemies, and romantic partners all fall under this umbrella. Certain relationships can get stronger now, while others may break down under the pressure. How do you feel when you’re with the people in your life? The ones that make you feel unsure are likely to disappear anyway, so don’t cling to them for safety.","A reality check may come today in the form of a physical accident or medical mishap, so it’s wise to act with discernment rather than jumping into risky situations. Any negative habits that have been creeping up on you could make themselves known, so if you notice that a fun pastime of yours isn’t so fun today, this is your sign to let that habit drop. Either way, it’s a good idea to use today to distance yourself from any routine self-sabotage. You deserve better.","The universe wants you to relax and enjoy yourself right now rather than force yourself to grow up. Connecting with your inner child can help to lighten your spirit and open pathways to abundance. Whatever situation you find yourself in today, try to lighten the mood a little! Being able to laugh at yourself and at frustrating situations will help you to see the world in new ways. Before you know it, the day may be over -- time flies when you're having fun.","Life at home may feel more tense than usual today. Mishaps around the house or emotional outbursts from family members are likely, and how to handle these situations may escape you in the moment. Try to release control and let your intuition be your guide. Now is not the time for intense confrontations. You’re more likely to be emotional if someone comes at you aggressively, and being aggressive back will probably end up in saying something that you will regret. Choose peace and compromise when you can."
2021-06-11,"Fortune favors the bold today, and intuition leads the bold to success. The empathetic Moon enters its home sign of Cancer, heightening our subconscious powers and allowing emotional intelligence to take the reins. As the Moon completes a trine with expansive Jupiter, we’re luckier when we follow our gut than when we deny how we feel. Finally, once active Mars enters expressive Leo at 9:34 am EDT, we’re more driven to express our creativity and sensuality. Following our hearts is practically a requirement today!","The universe is at a standstill today, unsure whether to move forward or backward. The sensitive Moon's square to rebellious Uranus creates an emotional reaction to change, driving us back into the comforting arms of stability. However, the Moon's square to rigid Saturn reminds us that stability doesn’t mean happiness, and we’re right back to the drawing board. The powerful energy created by Saturn's square to Uranus at 6:01 pm EDT demonstrates the battle between order and chaos and our role in balancing the two.","The time has arrived to dust off the cobwebs in your home, rearranging and redecorating as you please. You may have enjoyed the setup of your living space for quite some time, but suddenly the universe is inviting change into your environment. Collaborating with others on this is wise, so if someone is willing to come over and help, they’ll bring you fun and laughter as you work together. Consider treating them to a meal or coffee afterwards to thank them and to keep the positive energy flowing!","The atmosphere is right for you to show off your mind in the workplace and receive some recognition for all your mental prowess. Your sense of pride is deeply connected to your communicative abilities and your ability to work with others. Be humble in accepting the day’s attention, but realize that you deserve it for your efforts. Your financial situation may also feel more stable right now, and the better your emotional state is, the better your bank account will probably look.","You’re being charged up by all the lunar energy in the air, and you may be driven to look for new channels of income. Follow your instincts, even if you don’t understand them, because your faith is leading you to a simpler life. While you’re more likely to be sensitive to criticism now, remember that you don’t have to change yourself to fit in someone else’s mold. Don’t take anyone's opinions to heart but do ask yourself whether they are trying to help or projecting their own insecurities.","It’s time to play your cards closer to your chest and allow yourself to withdraw for now. You may have something that others want, and their jealousy both boosts your self-esteem and makes you a little suspicious. Be aware of your ego, because you could be feeling especially deserving and start taking out your frustrations on others. Think twice before you brag or criticize, and work to strike a balance between confidence and humility without swinging too far in either direction.","Relationships can be a source of generosity and enjoyment for you now, and you’re less likely to feel awkward or insecure in your interactions with others. Your heartstrings are tightly attached to the people you love, and the memories that you’re making today are ones that may stay with you for the rest of your life. Especially if your connections have centered around physical activities or trivial debates as of late, shifting your focus to emotionally involved and nurturing interactions can strengthen all your relationships.","You’re wearing your emotions on your sleeve right now, and you won’t benefit from trying to hide the things that are really on your mind. It’s difficult for you to dampen expressions of your feelings when they’re ready to burst out of you -- especially towards your friends and coworkers. While it’s not recommended to express yourself in ways that will hurt others, if there’s something that you really need to get off your chest, there’s no time like the present.","All your courage and fire is directed at your career right now, even though your heart may be somewhere else. Inside, you’re dreaming of the places that your ambitious actions and dedication will take you, and this piercing desire for fulfillment through your career is continuously fueling your passion. By being creative and combining your big dreams with your keen focus now, you’re more able to take concrete steps towards a career that will satisfy both your senses of security and adventure.","Something or someone may be tugging at your mind today, though it might not be what or who you expect. This isn’t meant to encourage you to return to a toxic relationship or situation of any kind, but if there’s someone that you haven’t seen in some time who keeps appearing in your thoughts, maybe it’s time to reach out and reconnect. Past interests and relationships are returning to remind you just what you loved about them.","Be wary of becoming obsessed or codependent during this time, because it can feel easy and natural to become consumed with someone else -- completely forgetting about yourself and other people that are important to you! You could feel joined at the hip with one person lately, whether they’re a close friend, a sibling, or a romantic partner. Make that extra effort today to communicate your appreciation to the other people who are there for you, and you may receive an opportunity from them in response.","You may be more driven to put down roots and make a commitment today. Although you might have been letting things remain flowy and flighty lately, it’ll be easier to get serious now with what you know is right for you. It may still be hard to pin you down, but you’re ready to go all-in to those things that still allow you your freedom. Financial opportunities are more available as well, as long as you’re not too caught up in these commitments!","The actions you take now will directly affect your future, and you know that. This conviction helps you be more committed to your routine. While it’s not always easy to see what the future holds, you have a clearer vision of what you want it to be. You create your own luck right now, so make sure that your mindset is tuned to optimism and confidence. Whatever you’re constantly thinking about will be magnified, so concentrate on what makes you feel happy and healthy!"
2021-06-12,"New friendships and other relationships can blossom today, as long as we’re willing to embrace a little bit of spontaneity. The sensitive Moon is meeting harmonious Venus in the emotional sign of Cancer, emphasizing the need to nurture each other and pay attention when someone voices their needs. The Moon's sextile to changeable Uranus at 5:11 am EDT may bring a surprise that improves the mood. Try to keep plans loose, because the energy of the day is more supportive when there’s freedom to be creative.","It’s time to go back to your roots, and this may improve your self-esteem in the process. You might feel like you’re changing rapidly while trying to find a career path that suits you, or at least one that financially supports you. This can be a drain on your energy, and can make it difficult to identify and connect with your true self. Think long and hard about your past interests today and let your loved ones replenish your lust for life.","Luck can come from your support system now, as people may be more generous with their help or with their money. Especially if you have siblings, now is a good time to catch up with them and see how you can mutually help each other with your struggles. Even just talking and laughing with them is bound to improve your day. Internal changes can happen now by settling disputes or putting grudges to bed, so embrace peace with loved ones.","You could have a lot of friends who are willing to support you in your endeavors, but it’s up to you to decide whose help to accept. Sometimes it’s hard to know what to change in your lifestyle that will improve it rather than create more issues, and it’s even harder when someone’s insisting to you that they know the right way to make it happen. Trust your inner voice and don’t let peer pressure cause you to make a choice that doesn’t resonate.","You could really cash in on your personal charm now, and attract people's full attention when you’re showing off your plans. This is a good time to network and meet new people, especially if you’re trying to get your name out there and be heard by people who can change your life. Whether it’s an interview for a new job or a better opportunity for your personal brand, make sure you’re showing up as your best self.","Deep feelings of desire may be lurking beneath the surface, either within you or someone else close to you. This could be something that you weren’t aware of, or that you had an inkling about but didn’t know for sure. While there’s no need to add to gossip, pay attention to what people are saying, because they might be clued into something that you’re not. Keep your eyes and ears open and your mouth closed and see just what you learn about the hearts of the people around you.","Your heart and your mind are connected to community now and you may be feeling more altruistic than usual. By giving in to this desire to help others, you could become connected with resources that were not available to you before. This may be a specific person who helps you or a new opportunity to expand your horizons. If you’re needing emotional guidance, ask the people around you for their wisdom. Chances are, they’ll have a point of view you haven’t considered.","Career matters and business relationships are highlighted for you today, even though it's the weekend. You’re likely to notice an easier time completing your tasks or making mutually beneficial business deals. Cooperating with everyone you work with and using your emotional intuition will help you to make the most of the current energy. You may also be able to figure out creative solutions to problems that have stumped you in the past. Try new things, because the old ways aren't necessarily working.","People may be expecting you to show up in a certain way today, but it could do them some good to be shocked by a new version of you. They might assume they'll see the same old you, but you're ready to show them the ways in which you’ve personally grown and changed. You might even reconnect with someone that you haven’t seen in a while, and both comment on how you’ve each changed. Give others the same space to grow that you would want from them.","Some of your routines may be shifting and you’ll need to shift with them. Flexibility will help you to avoid being thrown off course by these changes, but thankfully, they’re likely to be changes that you’ll enjoy. This could be a last-minute invitation or a surprise package in the mail that alters what you thought you’d be doing today. While it probably won't be a glamorous day, there will likely be a positive shake-up in the midst of everyday life.","You may find it easier to connect with others today, and could even surprise them with how open-minded you are being. You’re less likely to be judgmental and more likely to be supportive when others bring you their point of view; they'll appreciate not being under such a scrutinous eye. If you have a tendency to be the voice of criticism, let it go for a moment and see what it feels like to hear what they have to say without picking it apart.","There's a lot happening today ... maybe too much. You could feel as if there are too many obligations pressing on you that are preventing you from taking care of yourself. If solving other people's problems is always your priority, then your own needs will keep getting pushed to the bottom of the pile. Health and rest are especially important now. Your mission for the day is to spend some time catching up on self-care, without feeling guilty!","Opportunities for fun and games are likely to come your way, yet you'll need to make space in your life to enjoy them. People you know may want to cut loose with you, but if you’re too shy to join in, you could miss out on good times and great memories. It's likely you are thinking and feeling more optimistic now, and others will appreciate if you can have fun without needing to be too competitive. Loosen up, you’ll be glad you did!"
2021-06-13,"Dreams meet reality today and the difference between them can be hard to reconcile. The emotional Moon's trine to idealistic Neptune opens up our hearts to the possibilities, while perfectionist Venus' sextile to rebellious Uranus encourages us to create better solutions. Once the Moon conjuncts dynamic Mars, we are impatient to see the outcome, but the confident Sun's square to Neptune at 7:40 pm EDT may halt us in our tracks. Dreaming isn’t enough to make the life we want a reality -- it requires consistent work.","It’s time to go back to your roots, and this may improve your self-esteem in the process. You might feel like you’re changing rapidly while trying to find a career path that suits you, or at least one that financially supports you. This can be a drain on your energy, and can make it difficult to identify and connect with your true self. Think long and hard about your past interests today and let your loved ones replenish your lust for life.","Finances are highlighted for you now, and you may find that you don’t have the funds to get you where you wanted to go. Others may have put unrealistic expectations in your mind, and under their guidance, you’ve ended up somewhere completely different from where they said you were going. Instead of giving in to resentment, turn things around and rewrite the plan. Don’t let the soothing words of others trick you into being unprepared for the challenges between you and the level of success you desire.","You could be your own worst enemy today, so make sure that you’re not getting in your own way. Confusion regarding your career is likely, and you could miss something important if you don't set some alarms and reminders. You may also be feeling irritable, so remember to take a few deep breaths before you go off on someone for something small. The better prepared you are to combat mishaps with a zen attitude, the more likely you are to succeed.","Misunderstandings could prevent your progress now, so make sure that you and the other people in your life are on the same page. You may be holding a grudge against someone for something they did by accident, or vice versa, and this confusion is creating animosity. It surely won’t help you to run away from the problem -- clearing the air is better for everyone. Face your challenges now so that they won’t pop up again later on.","Crowdsourcing your thoughts and opinions probably won't go over well now, so be aware of this when trying to make decisions. This is one of those times when you probably do know yourself better than others know you, so trying to make decisions based on what someone else would do can throw you off of your rhythm. Although you may be feeling more emotionally passionate or even self-conscious now, don’t let embarrassment or fear of disappointing others hold you back from what you really want.","Your life goals may be getting in the way of some important relationships. You might have been acting like a workaholic lately, creating distance between yourself and the people who love you, even if you’re doing it all for them. While they probably do appreciate all that you provide, they also want to connect with your energy in person and spend time with you. Break free of the need to constantly be achieving and make sure that you’re making time to connect with those who matter to you.","It can be hard to explain yourself today, leading to miscommunications and different expectations. Someone may be giving you instructions to follow or simply communicating an idea, and end up disappointed with your response. Communicating clearly and having a realistic timetable for how long things will take will help you to avoid hurt feelings and arguments. At the end of the day, know that you can’t please everyone. You’re not a mind reader -- communication is a two-way street!","Your faith in others might be shaken today, especially if you've been taking things more seriously than they have. Make sure that you’re on the same page with your expectations, because you have the potential to lose your cool in the workplace or on group projects right now. Ultimately, you have no way of controlling other people’s actions, so if they’re not holding up their end of the bargain, simply let it go and move in your own direction.","Living your life for other people is difficult, and today you may see why this is true firsthand. Other people -- possibly roommates or family members -- might try to force you to conform to what they want for you for your life. You have to ask yourself if this is your dream or if it’s their dream before you commit. Communicate to others when they’re pushing past your boundaries -- any goals that don’t resonate with you should be put to rest.","You can’t expect to see progress where you haven’t been consistent. Similarly, you can’t expect to see wounds healing where you keep reopening yourself to the pain. If your consistent effort has been on relationships or activities that are detrimental to you, it’s time to remedy this and redirect your focus. Once you can begin transferring your constant attention to someone or something that nurtures you rather than takes from you, you may see that not everything has to be a struggle.","If you aren't paying attention to where your money is going today, it could just disappear. It's possible you will lose money due to being tricked or confused, or you may not be aware of what’s in your bank account and end up overdrafting when you least expect it. Look through your accounts carefully -- once you’ve made sure that there are no unexpected bills and no scammers affecting your cash flow, you can breathe easier knowing that you only have your own spending tendencies to control.","You could be of two minds right now, but it’s okay to be indecisive. You’re more likely to regret jumping into a commitment than you are to regret waiting a day to consider your options. It can be difficult to get in touch with your feelings now, and you may realize once you’ve committed that you want to flip back to the other option, but then it’s too late. Take the time that you need to make the right decision on the first try."
2021-06-14,"The universe is at a standstill today, unsure whether to move forward or backward. The sensitive Moon's square to rebellious Uranus creates an emotional reaction to change, driving us back into the comforting arms of stability. However, the Moon's square to rigid Saturn reminds us that stability doesn’t mean happiness, and we’re right back to the drawing board. The powerful energy created by Saturn's square to Uranus at 6:01 pm EDT demonstrates the battle between order and chaos and our role in balancing the two.","You may have a choice to make that affects your cash flow. While moving forward into uncertain territory poses a risk to your security, there’s also the potential for reward. Unfortunately, this opportunity may not allow you to keep certain relationships as strong, because you can’t pay attention to everything and everyone at once. Careful research and weighing your options will help you to make an informed decision that’s good for both your wallet and your friendships.","What you’re thinking and what you’re actually doing may be out of alignment right now -- perhaps you're not acting consistently, or you could be distracting yourself with smaller goals in order to avoid the big projects. Acknowledge the ways in which you’ve acted over the last few years and try to see where past goals are not fitting in with the plan you’ve made for your life. Be honest with yourself about your pace and your end goals, then adjust your actions and your timetable accordingly.","Fear can creep in disguised as preparedness, and you might set yourself back by trying to avoid doing anything wrong. Don't let your idea of perfection turn you to stone. While it’s great to set your sights as high as you can, make sure that you’re not trying to reach a level of perfection that is literally impossible. Improvement comes not through avoidance, but through repetitive action, so promise yourself that you’ll try again if at first you don’t succeed.","Love languages differ from person to person, and it's time to learn the languages your friends and loved ones speak. Where one needs to spend more time with you in person, another may need you to show love through words or tokens of appreciation. You can’t treat everyone you care about exactly the same -- you must be thoughtful of their feelings the same way you expect them to be thoughtful of yours. It’s worth it today to learn what makes someone else feel loved.","You could be offered a change in responsibility today, however, you might be unwilling to leave behind your current team to risk the new benefits. While you’re likely up for the task, the way you feel about the people that you spend your time with all day is important. This will be different for everyone, and you’ll need to weigh the pros and cons of taking on new responsibilities or titles. Rather than what everyone’s telling you to do, do what you know would make you personally happy.","Just because something sounds good doesn’t make it good, or even morally right. You might be grappling with moral principles versus reality today, possibly making you aware of an uncomfortable truth that you weren’t aware of before. Once you receive this new information, it will be up to you how to integrate it into your life. While this could challenge something that you believe strongly, it’s best to avoid letting dogma get in the way of opening your heart to something real.","You may be forced to depend on someone new today. Although this carries a risk, it still might be better than relying on someone that you already know, but who has proven themselves to be unreliable in the past. Who to trust and what to trust them with is the main theme for you now, and if your gut is telling you to trust one and not the other, then this is the best compass to lead you to success.","Someone you care about might be acting erratically today, or an old enemy could show up out of the blue. No matter who provides this source of chaotic energy, it’s in your best interest to act professionally. They may try to goad you into acting out of character as well, but don’t take the bait. There is no reason to react rashly over the attitude of someone else, especially if it can cause you to lose face. In the end, you’ll be happy you kept your cool.","Old habits die hard, and you may feel called back to negative behaviors of the past now. Although you may have already taken steps to combat these habits in order to set up a better future for yourself, this doesn’t mean you’ll never be tempted again. Make a pact with yourself to resist temptation today, even if it means saying no to a friend who means well. Your friends should want what’s best for you, but it’s up to you to stay committed to your decision.","It’s tempting to keep up walls around your heart, but it’s also tempting to be vulnerable now. Insecurity can rear its ugly head, creating a self-image that may lead you to avoid others or even avoid success, all in order to keep the spotlight off of yourself. It's sometimes hard for you to see what others see when they look at your accomplishments and talents. Today, spend some time with someone who helps you see the good in yourself.","Patterns that keep you trapped in the past are trying to change, but you might be clinging to them out of fear. Try to remove yourself from the situation emotionally and ask yourself if there’s anything there worth hanging on to, outside of nostalgia. You have the unique ability to optimize your situation right now, but you could be resisting it to hang on to something that you don't even really want. Be aware of why you’re making the choices you’re making, then decide if you still want to hold on.","The way you speak has a great effect on your thoughts and mood. Even if you've been replacing negativity with positivity lately, you may be slipping back into old manners of speech now. While it’s okay to call out violent or damaging behaviors, avoid being overly critical of yourself and others so that you can build more positive speech habits. When you’re quicker to find problems than you are to seek solutions, it’s time to re-evaluate your approach to life."
2021-06-15,"We can expect better communication and understanding today, after yesterday’s awkwardness and emotional confusion. The sensitive Moon sextiling intellectual Mercury helps us to marry our thoughts and feelings with ease, while the Moon’s later sextile to the proud Sun brings a sense of self-assuredness that we may not have had before. Finally, the Moon moves from confident Leo into detail-oriented Virgo at 11:02 pm EDT, inspiring us to tie up any emotional loose ends. It’s all coming back together!","Say what you need to say and you could solve most of your problems right off the bat. You may have been keeping your thoughts to yourself while your brain was brewing the answer, but it is finally time to let others know the things that have been on your mind. While you’re not obligated to explain yourself to anyone if you don’t want to, clarity and honesty now might help you find closure or avoid misunderstandings in the future.","Improvements are likely for your financial situation, brought about by your ability to be both reliable when you need to be and relaxed when it’s time to set down the work. Separating your job and your downtime is important now. Even if you work from home, it’ll be worth it to put a barrier in place to prevent you from sneakily finishing a project when you’re supposed to be recharging. Whatever it is, there’s no reason it can’t wait until you clock in tomorrow.","Feeling like yourself should come easily right now, and you’ll likely be communicating more freely. Others may see you as a social butterfly, flitting here and there in order to talk to everyone. Towards the end of the day, you’ll probably hit a wall when it comes to networking, making you ready to spend the night enjoying a smaller, more intimate discussion, rather than getting lost in a bigger buzz of conversation. The night's over when you run out of things to say!","You’re likely to play your cards closer to the chest now, unwilling to risk revealing all your personal business to everyone. Prying eyes may try to get you to say more than you’d like, but you don’t have to divulge anything more than what you’re comfortable saying. Your business is your business, and there’s nothing wrong with keeping things under wraps until you’re ready to reveal them. Spend time with people who can keep your secrets -- or at least keep conversations light!","Sensitivity is high for you today, and the thoughts and opinions of others may mean more to you than they usually do. Thankfully, it’s unlikely that many unkind opinions are coming your way, but even when others are complimenting and praising you, it’s important to keep your ego in check. Just as low self-esteem can discourage you, overly enthusiastic self-esteem can make you think you can do no wrong. Make sure that you’re not surrounded by yes-men and look for a voice of clarity.","Any work that you might have been doing behind the scenes could come to light now and help you shine in the workplace. If you’ve been putting in late hours or covering for others, it's likely that someone important has been noticing. While right now there might be only gratitude or a pat on the back in it for you, the goodwill that you’ll have created with others will encourage them to help you in the future.","Learning through others is an important theme for you today, and if you’re not paying attention, you might miss some crucial lessons. The emotional issues and interpersonal problems that your friends may be going through now could be a learning experience for you -- one that will keep you from making the same mistake down the road. However, if you’re only kind of listening to others while you wait for your turn to talk, then valuable information could slip away from you! Be as present as possible.","Focused energy is available to you now, but where to direct this focus has been left up to you. Through hard work and determination, you’ll be able to make great strides in your career. Even so, it’s easy to get side-tracked onto more interesting or fun subjects, causing you to procrastinate drearier tasks. While taking a break is okay, make sure that you won’t create a headache for yourself later by waiting to do your work until the last moment.","People may be demanding the majority of your energy now, leaving little time for you to focus on you. While you’re likely to enjoy working with others, make sure that you’re not creating setbacks for yourself. It's important to find a healthy balance between what you can give to others and what you save for you. Try to challenge yourself not to compromise your alone time, because you still need to keep up with the essentials in your own life.","You might have a lot on your plate now -- luckily, the people that you depend on are likely to show up for you in your time of need. If you don’t have to worry about every detail, you’ll be able to deal with more big-picture issues, and a group effort will lead you towards success. You could get in your own way, becoming too obsessed with doing everything yourself, so make sure you’re able to delegate to those willing to help.","You may have been working hard to secure your success lately, but all this hard work probably wasn’t very entertaining. Take a step back from the grind at the end of the day and allow yourself to get your mind off of work. Kick back, relax, and enjoy the peace, whether it be with a love interest, a friend, or even yourself. Consider decompressing by getting lost in a book or movie. Then, you’ll be ready to tackle whatever comes your way tomorrow!","There’s nothing wrong with getting back to basics and keeping things simple today. It may seem like some are doing the work of three people at once, making you feel judged for not allocating all of your time to your career. Instead of being critical of yourself, remember that life is short! If you’re not able to achieve what someone else is achieving, it’s likely because you’re moving at your own pace. Accept yourself and your personal rate of progress, as long as it feels right to you."
2021-06-16,"Kindness is golden, but taking advantage of the kindness of others will only hurt both people in the end. This is not a great time to meet new people, as the sensitive Moon opposes expansive Jupiter and giving will be more beneficial than receiving. The Moon's later trine to surprising Uranus at 11:07 pm EST may bring changes that we aren't expecting, but are happy to encounter. Anytime we are blessed with the generosity of others today, genuine shows of appreciation will go far.","Changes in your work environment could make things a little easier on you, but even changes that make things better can be annoying at first. You might find yourself needing to update your knowledge today in order to implement some new systems, or helping someone get up to speed on the way you do things in your workplace -- either way, it won’t necessarily be easy right off the bat. However, once you get acclimated to this new atmosphere, you’ll likely be welcoming it with open arms.","Strange as it may seem, simply having fun may be your best path to success today. Avoid waxing philosophical about any woes or worries in your life, because a conscious effort to let loose can help you set down your mental burdens and allow you some peace. Reach out to friends and loved ones for an enjoyable experience today -- the future will still be there after you watch that movie or spend time catching up with those you care about.","Important people in your life like your parents or other authority figures may be causing headaches for you -- you might even find yourself refusing an overabundance of their generosity. Sometimes it’s uncomfortable to accept more charity than you need or want, but when someone is pushing it toward you, it can be difficult to refuse. Maintain your boundaries without being judgmental, and remember that they’re probably only trying to show you that they love you. Still, you don't have to accept anything you’re uncomfortable with!","New elements in your social life could begin to improve your day-to-day life. It's possible someone is getting closer to you in your friend group, yet there may be a push-pull dynamic with this person and you’re not sure if you’re ready to open up more with them. It’s okay to not give everything all at once, because oversharing can cause regret later. Editing your boundaries is okay, but dropping everything that makes you comfortable in order to please someone else will create resentment.","Matters of sharing and finances are at the forefront for you now, and you could end up hurt by someone you trust. This may be someone who is leaving your life or someone who is leaving you hanging when you need them. Make sure you’re putting your trust in the right people, or else new problems can pop up that affect your money and your sense of security. What you bring in through your own efforts may be more reliable than what others are bringing to the communal table.","Someone who acts as a mirror for you could try to trigger you emotionally today. Realize that the less you focus on the comments of others, the more peaceful your day will be. People may feel more inclined to criticize you or control you, and you may need to stand up for yourself in situations where you are the underdog. Step into today with genuine intentions and be sure not to start any fights and you’ll be fine.","It may be difficult for you to determine how you’re feeling in the moment -- your agenda for the day could drive you to frustration before you realize what’s happening. You also are less likely to want to be put in the spotlight, so you may want to avoid situations that require you to be in front of several people. If it’s unavoidable, keep the focus on you to a minimum by thanking others and showing your appreciation. Accept the attention with humility and grace.","A friendship or other relationship may have been changing lately, and you could feel confused now about the person in front of you. They’re not the same as they used to be, but this is understandable. We all grow new sides to our personalities over time, and none of us live in a bubble. You’re not the same person that you were a year ago, so why expect them to stay the same? If you believe that you’re growing apart, you can do so without judging them.","You could feel torn today between putting a lot of effort toward your goals and resting to recover from all that you’ve already done. Instead of choosing to focus on either advancement or self-care, your wisest course of action now is to find a balance between the two. Work straight through the desire to give up, but rest when you’re tempted to do that extra work that's not necessary. Through equilibrium, you can find both professional and personal success.","Fun is on your agenda today, but two different opportunities or invitations for fun could pull you in opposite directions. It’s not good to try to do a million things at once now -- overscheduling yourself is a mistake, even if you really want to do everything offered to you. Understand your energy levels and know what’s required of you tomorrow, because while you want to dive right in today, you'll still need enough energy for what's to come. Flexibility is your friend now.","You could be living more in your head than in the present moment now, and this is preventing you from enjoying what’s going on around you. It's possible you'll receive a gift from a family member or a friend today, but worrying could prevent you from enjoying it. Life will be easier if you’re able to break free from your mental patterns, because whether you’re dwelling on the past or the future, it’s taking you away from where you’re supposed to be. Love the people you’re with.","Beware of running over people with your opinions, because you could come off as uncharacteristically abrasive or demanding today. Others will probably want to make you happy, but if you push them too far, you may end up receiving some backlash from those you’re asking for help. If you’re able to keep your ego in check, you’re more likely to get what you need. There’s even the potential to improve your relationships if you are able to listen, so close your mouth and open your ears!"
2021-06-17,"Now is the time to operate from the heart, rather than from the mind. The emotional Moon's square to thoughtful Mercury can create communication or travel issues, blocking progress and sending some of us back a few steps. The Moon's sextile to fair Venus shortly after inclines us toward love, despite what our logical mind is telling us to do. Finally, the Moon's trine to transformative Pluto at 9:10 pm EST creates a catalyst for us to do what’s right, even if it doesn’t look perfect.","Silence is a virtue now and actions will speak louder than words. Communication may not be your forte today, so if you’re needing to speak in front of people or communicate something important, be extra careful with what you say. You could feel inclined toward revenge if someone has been messing with you, but remain composed and let this person catch themselves up in their own words. Even if you pride yourself on being an honest person, not everything needs to be said. Leave some mystery in your life.","You could get caught in a financial snafu today if you aren't paying attention to how much money you have to spend. It’s all too easy right now to make a mistake when it comes to your budget, as you can overestimate or underestimate your money in ways that lead you astray. If you can, let important or expensive purchases wait until later. Meanwhile, the things you learn or practice right now have staying power, so be willing to be a student even if you’re not in school.","You may not be thinking very clearly today, so it's wise to leave important decisions for later. Take a few breaths before you jump into anything, because you're inclined to make emotional decisions that aren’t necessarily what you want. Patience and deliberation are your friends now -- speedy decisions are not always the best decisions. You may also feel a new level of intensity in a close relationship, so make sure you’re giving your time to people who actually care about you, not just those who make life thrilling.","Fears are often just fears -- just because a negative situation has cropped up in your mind doesn’t mean it’s actually playing out in real life. Giving in to your worries will only rub salt in the wound, so it may be time to fake it until you make it. Even if you’re worried about a situation, avoid bringing this up with others and speaking it into the universe. Be confident in yourself and be willing to connect with others without taking their needs personally.","Friends may not say what’s on their minds today, but be wary of projecting what they’re thinking. Just because they’re playing their cards close to their chest doesn’t mean they’re purposefully leaving you out -- besides, you’re not entitled to every facet of their lives. Instead of being afraid of missing out, know that there will always be sides of people that they don’t share with you, just like you have secrets sides of yourself. This doesn’t reflect negatively on you or them, some just need more privacy than others.","Your work and other responsibilities require extra attention right now, because the details can easily escape you and cause issues with your coworkers or clients. You’re more likely to impress others with your charisma and your social prowess, but critical thinking may escape you. You can also be more emotionally sensitive, so make a decision at the top of the day to not let what others say you affect you in the moment. Jumping to conclusions is your worst enemy now, so count to ten first.","Energetic shifts in your home or within your family are likely today, giving you reason to pause when you’re meant to accept these changes. You may come home to all the furniture being reorganized, or a new haircut on someone you live with. Although the changes may shock you at first, try not to cling too tightly to the old and avoid criticizing the new. It can feel strange accepting a change in your environment that you didn’t initiate, but going with the flow is your best bet for peace.","Anxiety may set in today and these worrisome thoughts can hold you back if you let them. Seeking inspiration from your loved ones or from art can help you to turn this around. Art doesn’t have to be a painting in a museum, art can be a television show that brings you comfort or a song that helps you express yourself emotionally. While distractions can be bad in excess, in this case, it's smart to distract yourself from negative thoughts or fears. Turn your eyes to the light.","Criticism is never fun to receive, yet it’s useful to know which criticism you should accept and which should be left where it is. There are always going to be those people who throw out their critical thoughts without batting an eyelash, but even the people whose advice you usually respect might get it all wrong today. Focus on your own vision and don’t let others get in the way of your happiness, even if they mean well.","You may be so locked in with your mental focus right now that you aren't allowing yourself room to grow. Only nurturing one side of who you are can cause you to feel like other pieces of yourself are missing, and may even cause burnout. Make sure that you’re balancing how you nurture your body, mind, and soul, and recognize when you’re giving too much favor to one or the other. You’re meant to be a fully realized person, you don’t have to limit yourself!","Time flies when you’re having fun, and that’s especially true for you now. Don’t let good times cause you to procrastinate your work. If you’re not disciplined with fulfilling your responsibilities, you'll have stress on your mind while you’re trying to enjoy what’s distracting you from your responsibilities! Get your work out of the way so you can enjoy yourself freely. If you’re actually able to take the day off from your duties, this is a great time to make plans for the future.","Someone in your family could have harsh words for you today, or perhaps you feel that your family's expectations for your life are weighing heavily on you. Avoid indulging yourself in guilt or regret related to the past, because this is something that’s holding you back from embracing your full potential. Friends may have wisdom for you that will help you to separate yourself from what your loved ones want, and help you to realize you can follow your own path."
2021-06-18,"Thoughtfulness combines with passion to create an atmosphere in which love can thrive. With the emotional Moon entering harmonious Libra, our thoughts become idealistic, allowing us to think of others first. After all, it’s easier to create a kind world when we’re actively giving back. When the Moon’s sextile to energetic Mars at 12:32 pm EDT fans the fiery feelings inside, it may be hard to hold back from what we really want. Find a balance between self-control and living life to the fullest.","Your social life could pick up steam in an intense way today. You may find that you have a stronger desire to emotionally and physically connect with others, so if you need a hug from your loved ones, don’t be afraid to ask for one. People may also be more willing to give you support in your relationships and with your family now, especially if you have children. Don’t hesitate to speak up for what you want!","Organizing your home or workspace today could have an energizing effect on you. Make sure that you’re not stressing yourself out with clutter and making things harder on yourself. If you’ve been craving more structure in your life, now is a great time to create it. You’ll feel invigorated after improving your environment, and it’ll be easier to connect with your family or roommates once the space is more comfortable. Freshen up your life by freshening up your home!","Creativity and enthusiasm are flowing for you! You’re ready to say what you feel, so if you don’t feel it, don’t say it. Being true to your emotional center and saying yes to what makes you excited about life will take you far. The people who support you are likely to boost your ego with encouragement right now as well. However, if you’re not paying attention, you can dominate conversations in no time. Life will be more fun as a discussion than a monologue.","Home and security are highlighted for you, allowing you to benefit in both areas with less effort and energy expended. Where you may once have been flailing, you’re now better able to find a rhythm and move forward with purpose rather than just wander around. With a stronger inner drive, it’s easier to focus your efforts and increase your cash flow without getting distracted by all the different options for making money. The more concentrated your efforts, the better the results!","Thoughts and feelings are up for discussion today, and you can trust your inner voice to help you find the right words. Sometimes in conversation, it’s more about how you say something rather than the actual words you use. Thankfully, it should be easier for you to pick the right time, place, and sentences to express what’s inside your heart now. Your friend group is probably open to talking about emotions as well, so if you need to, let it out!","Your finances could receive a boost from an unseen place today, increasing your security without much pageantry. Perhaps some of the moves you've made in private begin to pay off, or you might find a hidden partner in business. Although you don’t need fanfare to know you’re succeeding, people might still be speaking about your reputation behind closed doors. Things are happening that you can't see now, so allow spontaneous decisions and quiet connections to help you network and strengthen your sense of self.","How you feel is just as important as how other people feel, and it’s time to treat yourself like it! Putting yourself on the backburner is not an option right now. If it seems as though you’re not acting like your usual self, perhaps you simply haven’t felt like the fun and free version of yourself in a long time. Connect with friends that help you feel alive and bring out your inner fire, and circulate these good feelings around.","You might be keeping your heart a mystery, but your actions and contributions are likely to be seen and appreciated by others. More energy in the workplace and a stronger drive to climb your career ladder can lead you to success now. While some may feel threatened by your new burst of energy, most will appreciate the speed and determination with which you attend to your responsibilities. Use your intuition to guide this power -- it may benefit you to keep your hunches to yourself.","The planets are ready to get going today, and they’re invigorating you to do the same! You might find yourself working at twice your normal speed and energy. Expect to study or practice quickly if you’re learning anything new, yet it would benefit you to write things down rather than just reading them and expecting to absorb the information. Travel may also improve for you soon, broadening your horizons and expanding your mind. The more open and attentive you are now, the more you’ll grow.","Your heart may be even more attached to your work and responsibilities than usual, and you can make good investment choices with your time and money today. Just be wary of committing to too many projects and people, because in the future you may not be able to access the ambition and drive that you have right now. Allow your inner vibrancy to shine in the projects you do accept, and don’t allow others to take advantage of you just because you’re eager to work.","You could learn a lot through others now, especially when it comes to expressing your feelings. You may be someone who holds everything inside when you experience strong emotions to try and deal with them later. However, doing that can make it difficult to understand those repressed feelings. It’s easier to be more vulnerable and expressive with the people that you love right now, so let it happen! The world won’t end just because you shared your emotions -- it may even become brighter.","Your emotions might feel particularly intense at the moment, but getting organized and keeping your mind off of things that you can’t control will help you avoid being overwhelmed. You would also be wise in this situation to stay occupied -- don’t let the extra mental energy that’s available to you turn into obsession or worry. Boredom will be the worst thing for you to endure right now, so find a healthy place to direct all this intensity."
2021-06-19,"Instant gratification may not be an option today. The sensitive Moon’s trine to disciplined Saturn encourages us to invest in foundations for our lives, because it’s important to work for what we want. The Moon then trines communicative Mercury, deepening our understanding of what’s best for both our hearts and minds. Once the Moon squares beautiful Venus at 5:07 pm EDT, superficiality and luxury will lose in the face of reliability and quality. Remember to treasure what lasts, rather than what glitters.","Connections with family members might be strained for you today, but your other relationships should be there to pick up the pieces. Sometimes, when our biological families seem unable to connect the dots, our found families are better able to understand what we’re going through. Speak your feelings in the presence of people who get you, and take a short road trip if you feel the urge to break out of your routine. A change of scenery could inspire you!","Finances and career could be successful areas for you now, but communication can be your downfall if you don’t watch what you say. It may be easier to keep your head down and focus on the work that’s in front of you, because too much conversation or planning with others could end with you putting your foot in your mouth. As long as you respect yourself and others with your words, most problems can be avoided before they even begin.","Your sense of self and clarity of mind are strengthened by the universe currently, allowing you to be yourself to the fullest without needing everyone to be just like you. Use this time to make plans for your future and, if you feel so inclined, write a mission statement that lets your character shine. Your morals might feel very defined, but others probably won't respond well if you force anything on them. Be secure in who you are without needing to convince others you’re right.","Sometimes you might feel like your own worst enemy, but there are enough bullies in this world without you joining them. It’s time to embrace the people who emotionally support you, and leave behind the negative self-image that keeps you down. When you feel like you’re slipping into pessimistic or cynical self-talk, ask yourself if you would ever speak to one of your friends that way. If the answer is no, then try to start seeing yourself as a friend -- and treating yourself with the kindness a friend deserves.","Worries about beauty or love could create some insecurity for you now, and you might wonder if the people around you are trying to build you up or tear you down. It’s important to fill your life with quality friends and good energy. Becoming accustomed to a certain type of treatment may be easy, but recognizing when your friend group is more of a hindrance than a support is important. Value yourself, and prioritize others who will do the same!","Speed and accuracy are always helpful with work or other responsibilities, but especially right now. Unfortunately, a friend could encourage you to throw away progress by overindulging in unhealthy habits or spending too much money once the workday has ended. After working so hard, do you really want to blow your paycheck on something that you didn’t know existed before today? Set some guidelines for yourself regarding money and health, and do your best to stick to them.","Knowing the truth and thinking that you know the truth aren’t the same thing. Right now it may be easy to forget that rumors can be spread with no truth behind them, and the stories that your friends tell you might be embellished to better captivate your attention. No matter how juicy the tale is, reserve judgment when you hear gossip during this time. Try to be understanding of the subjects of any rumors -- after all, they’re not there to defend themselves!","The planets are focused on your future today, egging you on to build something that you can be proud of down the road. Your emotional drive behind creating this stability in your life is likely inspired by a family member or someone else very close to your heart. This is noble, but try not to get caught up in the moment and rush your plans. The more you hurry, the more revising you’ll need to do later.","Obsession may creep into your relationships now, and too much emphasis on one person could drive them away. Make sure that you’re not expressing your passion for the people that you care about by trying to control or contain them, and be willing to take a step back if you notice yourself getting a little too intense. Being so focused on someone else may not be a mode that you shift into often, so seek out a balance between independence and caring for others.","The people around you may not be the best financial advisors today. Long-term financial choices should probably be made alone, because making them with a partner could throw a wrench into your bank account. Others are likely to be the reason you mishandle money or commit to something that you later realize you don’t like. While it’s fine to discuss budget plans with your loved ones, if it’s not an area of expertise for them, take their recommendations with a grain of salt.","Dreams for the future may be at the front of your brain, and self-discipline and spiritual healing aren’t far behind. However, the duties that you have to the other people in your life could take up a large part of your routine, making you feel like there’s no time to work on your personal life. Don’t use this as an excuse to drop your friends and responsibilities, but consider making a more serious attempt at carving out time to connect with your inner self.","Isolation may be your one companion at the moment, but luckily it’s allowing you to take a breather and rest up before you get back into the ring. You could be having more fear-based dreams these days, and trying to figure out where these are coming from can create more worries than just accepting how you feel. Without trying to find a reason for why your emotions are stirred like this, just let them exist without judgment. You always have tomorrow to analyze yourself!"
2021-06-20,"Strong currents of emotion are flowing, creating a window into our true feelings. The Moon enters Scorpio and then connects with several planets, creating a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the day. An energy shift occurs at 11:06 am EDT as expansive Jupiter turns retrograde in Pisces, and instead of projecting onto the world, we begin introspectively thinking about the ways we express ourselves. Finally, the Sun enters nurturing Cancer, highlighting our need to get in tune with how we feel. If the logical choice feels wrong, go with the heart.","You may find yourself being drawn away from how you’ve always done things in order to find a method that feels better for you, rather than one that is geared toward efficiency. If you’ve noticed that the way you’ve been running your household or structuring your week is beginning to burn you out, it might be time to be honest with yourself about how you really feel. Recognize where you’ve been minimizing your intuition so that you can start to maximize your spiritual growth.","Communication can flow today, but everyone you wanted to talk to may have disappeared. It’s possible you will feel a bit isolated, and you could feel like you missed the boat to say something important to someone in your life. Worry not, because you haven’t missed out on anything. Ultimately, whatever is for you will find you in the end. Just remember how you feel right now, so that when you have the opportunity to say something next time, you’ll say what’s in your heart.","Your work life could be slowing down, but you have other opportunities to create cash flow. You may have a smaller clientele right now, or you’re scheduled for fewer hours at your place of work. This is meant to allow you time to re-evaluate your career and reorganize where you could be letting things fall to the wayside. It can be difficult to stay motivated, but the more you realize you’re creating something positive for yourself, the easier it will be to maintain your ambition.","Welcome to your season! As the Sun moves into your sign today, you can focus more on yourself and make great strides on personal projects and self-improvement. Others are more willing to support you as well, but cloudiness or a lack of direction can create roadblocks for you, especially if your everyday actions aren’t aligned with what you really want for your life. If you can visualize the end goal, but can’t see how the person you are can achieve that, it may be time to adjust course.","When you see trouble up ahead, it’s okay to change paths. You may be following your heart now, after something you used to believe stopped ringing true to you. Someone might have revealed their real character to you, and you aren’t sure that you like what you’re seeing from them. Even if you want to be loyal and stick with them no matter what, don’t continue to act like nothing is wrong if you feel something is off. Trust your inner judgment.","You're entering a time of more fun and laughter with friends, but close partnerships may begin to cool down. If you've been involved in an especially tight romantic, business, or even platonic relationship recently, this is a good time to step back and reconnect with the other people in your life. Close bonds can be thrilling but they can also take over. Bring back balance by spending time with the friends who have always had your back.","You may have been taking advantage of opportunities for travel and learning lately, and you’re now entering a time when you’ll be able to apply what you’ve discovered. You'd be wise to consider your career game plan, because ironing out the details can help you usher in a time of confidence and leadership in your life. This won’t happen without your efforts behind it, but luckily, all the ways you’ve recently grown can support you.","Exploration is calling your name, and you're ready to answer it. You might feel yourself drifting into daydreams today about far-off places or moving into a new home, but it can be hard to focus on your real-world tasks when your head is in the clouds. Give yourself time to brainstorm so that your dreams can find their way onto paper or even a vision board. The winds of adventure are blowing, so if you can, put your busy schedule on hold!","You may need to find a place of inner solace today, because on the outside, it’ll be hard to find a quiet moment. Others could be interfering in your business or talking nonstop and keeping you from thinking straight. You might simply not be interested in socializing and enjoying life to the fullest right now, preferring to curl up with a good book or even take a nap. If you’re starting to feel drained, it’s smart to bow out and come back when you’re feeling rested.","Creating strong bonds is possible now, as long as you're willing to step out of your comfort zone. Sticking your neck out can be intimidating, but if you never say anything, then it’s not likely that the other person will either. It may be difficult to make the move or to find the right words, so let your actions do the talking and show the people you care about that you’re there for them. Not everything requires a long explanation -- people will remember how you made them feel.","Changing scenarios in the workplace may cause you to feel insecure with your place there. This won't necessarily be anything severe -- expect more awkward or annoying situations that can cause you to consider your comfort zone. The better you are at creating your own stability and knowing your own worth, the easier it will be to handle the antics of others. You’re not responsible for how other people choose to present themselves in your daily life, but you are in control of how you respond.","Thinking leads to overthinking now, and if you’re not careful, you could think yourself into standing still. Everyone moves at their own pace, but you might be paralyzing yourself by analyzing a situation too carefully or being too much of a perfectionist. Friends and loved ones may present opportunities to have fun and let loose today, but you could miss them if you’re too preoccupied with what might go wrong. You don’t have to be perfect, you just have to keep growing."
2021-06-21,"Accepting change can help us avoid moving backward. The sensitive Moon's opposition with off-kilter Uranus may throw us off our rhythm, creating shocking situations that we must emotionally handle before we can move on. Luckily, the rest of the day is vibrant with inspiration and collaboration, under beautiful Venus' trine to idealistic Neptune at 9:57 am EDT, followed by the Moon's trines to both Neptune and Venus. Dreamy situations flow forth from this energy when we focus on our ideal futures, so dream big!","Financial surprises could crop up today, causing you to feel off balance in your security. Thankfully, these issues are likely to resolve themselves before the day is over, and you will be able to enjoy the remainder of the day by waxing nostalgic with your loved ones. The more beautiful your surroundings are, the better your mood and outlook will be. Sprucing up your home or garden can help you to connect with your body and create a peaceful atmosphere.","When you don’t have it all together, the people who love you can help to pick up the slack. With so much on your plate, you might not know what to do when something falls through the cracks. Your mind can be all over the place today, so you could miss some of the finer details when it comes to planning. Try to be humble if you make an honest mistake, and others will likely be understanding. After all, we’ve all been there!","You have the opportunity to experience more financial flow, but imposter syndrome or other fears might be standing in the way of your progress. It's also possible you are being doubted by other people, and you feel like you need to defend your character or ability. You know your worth. Focus on what you can be thankful for today, and don’t spend too much time worrying about the opinions of others who don't know the whole story.","You may find yourself in the spotlight today, but while there are people supporting you, others may throw you a curveball. Beware someone trying to cause havoc in the middle of your good time. This is a day where shocking events can happen to anyone, but for Geminis specifically, the shock is likely to happen to or because of someone close to you. Even if it dampens your mood, try to be understanding -- the situation may have been out of their hands.","Chaos in the workplace could make you want to give up, but don’t throw in the towel just yet! Being honest with yourself about what you’re going through -- without needing to broadcast your life to the world -- can help you make it through the day. Someone who loves you may be able to help you with this struggle, someone who knows how to encourage you when things get rough. Cozy and intimate encounters hold magic now, so keep your friends and loved ones close.","This can be one of those rare times when it seems like everyone in your life is getting along with one another, even the people who normally want to play devil’s advocate. You may feel a sense of peace and calm surrounding your conversations that helps you get through the day without arguments or friction. Conversation can flow easily and you might find yourself talking about everything under the sun, so beware of oversharing if you don’t know your conversation partner that well!","The energy inside you may be swinging like a pendulum, while everything looks okay on the surface. This could involve a decision that needs to be made, and you’re trying to keep a poker face while you wrestle with the choices internally. If you’re not ready to make a decision, then it’s okay to hold off until later in the day at least. Wise counsel from someone in your life may end up turning the tide for this choice, so pay attention to what they have to say.","Someone in your life might be in a stage of rebellion, and you may feel the need to join in with them. If they’re making a positive change, then it’s okay to get up and try to support them through participating. However, if it’s an unhealthy or negative change, then try to maintain your individuality and let them know that you’re on the path that you want to be on. Your luck and ambition are boosted now, so seek out people who encourage you to improve your life.","Surprises in the more routine parts of your life can knock you off your balance today, and even the most reliable people may shock you. It will help to find a way to ground yourself and be willing to let the day flow where it may. The vibes are more pleasant as the day goes on, allowing you to emotionally relax after the unpredictability of your daily responsibilities. Having a laugh with loved ones over dinner can help you unwind and shake off the stress.","Your heart may be focused on the other people in your life now, but make sure that you’re not sacrificing your own peace in order to create peace for everyone else. Generous intentions are admirable, but you can create resentment on both sides if you’re doing all the work and they’re unable to reciprocate because you won’t let them. Create room for other people to give back to you, or, if you think you’re the one who needs to give back to balance the scales, do something unexpected for them today.","Your perception of the past could be altered by new information today, and you may not know how to take it right away. Someone in your family or someone who's known you a long time might give you their perspective on something that you remember differently, or that someone told you differently. Give it time to marinate and don’t jump to conclusions right away. Whatever the outcome, remember that it’s in the past and that it shouldn’t keep you from moving forward into the future.","Miscommunication or forgetfulness can throw off your plans for the day, but it’s nothing that isn’t correctable. If you can be flexible, you should be able to salvage anything that needed to be rerouted. You are blessed with an extra dose of luck right now, in love and even with friends and family, who are likely to be more willing to compromise with you. Laugh off any roadblocks and be patient because your luck can grow as the day goes on!"
2021-06-22,"Words held inside may be ready to be spoken out loud. The emotional Moon enters bold Sagittarius today, taking our focus away from self-protection and creating a lighter point of view. However, with the Moon’s square to expansive Jupiter, there’s a tendency to go overboard. We’ve got a lot to say and clearer minds to express our thoughts once Mercury finally goes direct in Gemini at 6:00 pm EDT. We can use this to our advantage when the Moon then trines headstrong Mars, encouraging us to be honest about how we feel.","Honesty is the best policy, but some things don’t need to be said in the heat of the moment. Speaking in anger may be tempting if someone pushes your buttons, but you’re not likely to change anybody’s mind by retaliating. It’s better to take a deep breath and find your zen. That said, it’s OK to stand your ground and not allow people to push you around. With self-control and a handle on your emotions, you’re likely to be the one who comes out looking better.","It might feel as if your friends are giving you less attention lately, which could cause you to feel lonely. Connecting with someone that you can trust would be best, as you’re more inclined to deep conversations right now, rather than small talk. Reach out if you are eager to interact, especially if one particular person comes to mind as a companion. Talk to those who make it safe to be truthful, and don’t forget to pay attention when it’s your turn to listen.","Talking too fast can get you into trouble, even if you genuinely just want to share knowledge. You can be more expressive now, but trying to show off information that you’re not sure is accurate could end up coming back to bite you. Gossip especially can create problems, as it only spurs the spread of more rumors. Before you talk yourself into a situation you didn’t ask for, ask yourself if what you have to say will contribute to the conversation in a positive way.","Anxiety is in the air at the moment, and you might jump to the worst-case scenario or let the fear of failure hold you back. Old worries can crop up today, but fortunately, being active can help to stave off scary daydreams. Tell yourself that you do deserve the best and you can achieve it if you try. Turning your mind to more productive matters, even those as simple as household chores, can help you distract yourself from pessimism.","Someone that you trust might be absent from your life currently, creating a hole where your friend and wise counsel used to be. Whether they are on vacation or gone in a more permanent sense, you can likely feel their absence. You may feel directionless, but there’s also an inner drive to do something, anything to distract yourself! While it’s unwise to go overboard with spending money, give yourself some freedom to be spontaneous and have fun. Rejuvenate yourself by doing what you love.","A deeper, more intuitive energy is accessible to you now, one that can lead you to a healthier situation. It's possible that someone has recently become distant from you, and you could already know why. While it might be tempting to call them back into your life, ask yourself if they made you feel like you were better or worse around them. We become who we surround ourselves with, so look at all your relationships -- past and present -- with clarity.","There are problems that need solving today, but they aren’t necessarily your problems! Still, you may be inclined to get preachy, so make sure that you’re not handing out advice when other people aren’t asking for it -- even if it seems like their life is a wreck from your perspective. Sometimes we think we’re being helpful, but it turns out that we were perceived as being bossy or nosy. Being a listening ear will be enough.","Being mutually obsessed with someone else can be exciting, but putting all of your focus on one person could make them feel like they’re under a magnifying glass. In addition, their own enthusiasm for you could cause them to get possessive. No matter how fun it is, make sure a close connection isn't causing you to neglect the other relationships in your life. While togetherness is wonderful, try to get some space and catch up with someone you haven’t seen in a while. Remember, absence makes the heart grow fonder.","You may notice that other people have a lot to say about your life, while simultaneously not listening to your responses. Unless you’ve seriously hurt someone or yourself, this may be a situation where you will need to set boundaries. People are free to say what they please, but there’s no need for you to allow others, no matter how well they know you, to criticize or discuss you without your input. What’s right for them may not be right for you, and it's OK to say so.","Your routine could fall into a rhythm now, where it might have felt unstructured over the last few weeks. Other people changing plans may have kept you from finding a system that works for you, but you should start to see some progress that can help you get more organized. Once you’ve worked out the kinks in your agenda, make sure to sort out any issues with your mode of transportation or electronic devices. Maintenance now can prevent annoying issues from cropping up in the future.","Some free time may finally be coming your way, and you might be tempted to spend everything you earned while you were busy working. Instead of giving in to temptation immediately, put away a little money for a rainy day. Your financial flow could be less than normal, and spending time with those you love will be more spiritually fulfilling than buying a bunch of material items that just popped into view. Resist the urge to spend and you’ll thank yourself for it.","There's activity on the home front today as any renovations or repairs will likely begin to pick up speed, and anyone trying to move homes could see more progress as well. Don’t feel bad if you feel like you’ve fallen behind on prior projects that you were excited about, just use this time to catch up. Right now, you have access to stronger ambition and work ethic than before, and you just have to maintain your confidence. Once you’re committed to yourself, you’ll be able to tackle that checklist."
2021-06-23,"Confidence can turn into doubt, but only if we let it. The sensitive Moon sextiles disciplined Saturn at the break of day, starting us off feeling secure. That, combined with the confident Sun’s trine to optimistic Jupiter, can make it feel as if nothing could go wrong. However, the Moon opposing tricky Mercury may throw us a curveball with forgotten commitments or misunderstandings. Then, perfectionist Venus opposes turbulent Pluto at 7:39 pm EDT, which can create doubt and excessive criticism. Go easy on yourself and others -- nobody’s perfect!","Your words may have more power over others right now than you think they do. Although you may feel like you’re just being honest and sharing your opinion, you might not be giving others room to do so in turn. If they don’t speak up when you give them an opportunity, however, it’s not your job to shrink yourself in order to make them more comfortable. Be rational and level with your words, and respect others when they do the same.","Friends may compliment you today and make you feel secure, then in the next sentence -- intentionally or otherwise -- say something that insults you. Instead of letting your feelings blow around in the wind with someone’s words, stand strong and don’t let their opinions damage your self-confidence or cause you to lose faith in yourself. Besides, their comment probably wasn’t meant to slight you. Even if it was, you’re where you are now for a reason, and no one has the power to dismiss your journey outright.","Hiccups caused by miscommunication or a total lack of communication could create a rift in your plans. You may have committed to something that you’re no longer able to do, or perhaps you receive a bill that’s much higher than you thought it would be. Do your best to roll with the punches; use your wits to help you to remedy any issues. Being prepared and appreciating others for their time will help you make the best of today.","You may be more sensitive in matters of love and friendship right now, and a tendency to act passive aggressively could arise if you feel that someone is taking your place. Don’t give in to fear and doubt! Instead, be thankful for what makes you happy, and realize that there’s no reason to look for the worst in these relationships. If there is an issue that you can’t shake, let the other person know how you’re feeling so they’re not left in the dark.","Having good intentions is one thing, but creating the desired results is another. You may want to lift someone up with words, gifts, or good deeds, but think before you act! Ask yourself if this is something that they want or if you’re projecting your own likes onto them. Your desires are not one-size-fits-all, and you may be spending money on an expensive gift that this person will never use. Instead, buy what you want for yourself, and find out what they personally need to feel loved.","Emotional adjustments and dramatic circumstances in the workplace are more likely now, creating frustrating situations that may trap you between two stances. Resist the urge to pick sides or coddle someone who’s been behaving badly, even if they’re your friend. You’re capable of remaining neutral without losing friends, and if you pick a side, you’re more likely to create hurt feelings. In the spirit of a peaceful environment, do what you can to keep from getting involved.","Disagreements involving the authority figures in your life are likely to arise, and these people may try to restrict you with words. If they’re insisting that it’s their way or the highway, this is a sign that they’re more interested in controlling you than doing what’s best for you. While it can be frustrating to try and maintain your individuality under people who have power over you, finding a compromise that will benefit both of you in some way is the wisest course of action.","A secret may be revealed today that creates tension or awkwardness in your relationships. This doesn’t have to be your secret, but it’s likely one that you already know about -- you may have even been present when it was originally being told. Do your best to avoid becoming the loose lips that give the secret away, because broken trust can damage friendships and start arguments. Even if it’s an exciting one, keep this story under lock and key!","Someone may strike a nerve in you today, bringing upsetting emotions from zero to sixty in no time flat. What they say may not even be directed at you personally, but they might dismiss or speak unkindly regarding a topic that you feel strongly about. Jumping to conclusions and verbally fighting back could catch them off guard and send them into defense mode. While it may not be the more appealing action, it’ll be worth it to explain gently why you’re disappointed.","Revisiting something that made you happy in the past could inspire you in the present. While trying to get back into an old hobby can be difficult, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. You may need to retrain your muscles for a sport you used to play or reread the tutorial for a game you once loved, but your skills are probably still there. Someone else in your life may even provide an opportunity today to reconnect with something you previously enjoyed, so give in and have fun!","Showing vulnerability may not be your strong suit, but today you will have the opportunity to show someone else that you care. This will probably be an act of service, where someone in your circle will ask for your help, or you may see their need without them having to say anything. They may not necessarily show their gratitude in the moment, but as long as your method of help isn’t too invasive or pushy, you can assume they will be thankful for it.","Your family or the people that you live with may not understand your goals, but don’t let their confusion make you disheartened. It may take time for them to warm up to new ideas -- or this could be a misunderstanding that turns into something more argumentative. Be patient and recognize that they still love you, but just aren’t able to conceptualize your vision. Once you’re able to make that vision a reality, it’ll be easier for them to understand."
2021-06-24,"Our focus is sharpening and we have no excuses today! The emotional Moon enters structured Capricorn this morning, encouraging improvement in our quality of life. Anything that’s worth having requires a bit of effort on our parts now. The Moon's midday sextile to generous Jupiter sweetens the pot, providing an easier route to success and giving us room to improve. The energy of the day culminates in the Full Moon in Capricorn at 2:40 pm EDT, which can reward us for consistency, or reprimand us for our lack thereof.","Some things in your life could use some repair, while others should be set free all together. You have a wonderful chance to refresh your environment now, fixing what you want to remain in your life and removing whatever is dragging you down. You’re most likely to see the fruits of your labor in the career department. Your luck may come from somewhere unexpected, or perhaps a job perk that you weren’t privy to before will be brought to you by a superior. Opportunity is knocking!","You may have felt stuck in your relationships recently, but pushing people away isn't the answer. Even if you think that you can do it all on your own, you can make more progress through interacting with the wiser and more worldly people in your life. Teachers or other mentors could give you useful advice that helps you to get out of your own way, and friends can bring you good times and conversation. Be open to laughing with and learning from others.","You may be feeling trapped right now, but there's a reason you're here. Sometimes the structure that you build for yourself can end up feeling like a prison if you give yourself more structure than you reasonably want. This might be especially true now, and you could be resisting these new routines or extra responsibilities, even if you’re the one who initially signed up for them! Instead of trying to run from the schedule you’ve created, remember why you were so excited to start in the beginning.","Someone in your life may be trying to reinvent themselves, and you're unhappy that the old person you knew is fading away. While it’s okay to love the person that someone was, if you wish to keep them in your life, you must allow them to grow and change into the person that they feel themselves becoming. Trying to control the natural path of someone else is not your job, and once you’re able to find peace with that, you’ll feel much more at ease.","Good habits can pay off today, and opportunities to end bad habits could arise as well. If you’ve dedicated yourself to bettering your life through the use of a new daily practice, then you will likely see results as you look around; you may have paid off a bill, met a fitness goal, or rebuilt a relationship. Or, if you notice a bad habit is giving you more annoyance than enjoyment, take steps now to let it go. No matter how small, you’re making progress.","Pressure can take away from the fun, especially if the pressure is to have fun. You may feel the need to control what’s going on around you in order to bring about the end result that you’re desiring today. Creating the perfect environment may be impossible, and someone else could add pressure of their own to you as well, but it will not benefit you to take that on. Remind yourself throughout the day, you’re just one person!","You might feel the need to remove yourself today from a place you enjoy, but ask yourself if you actually don’t want to be there anymore, or if there’s someone who’s making you feel unwelcome. You don’t have to run away from the group or the location just because one relationship has become uncomfortable -- sticking around may even bring you the chance to stand on your own. If you want to be there, then be there.","Others can be willing to share with you now, but you must make yourself available if you wish to receive it. You’re unable to be seen from the sidelines, and you won’t catch anyone’s notice by playing the background. If you don’t put yourself out there, then others won’t know that you were an option for them to choose from. It can be hard to know how to gauge your own worth, but once you show others that you value yourself highly, they’ll be more likely to do the same.","Everyone's comfort zone is different, and today, you may need to be honest about where your comfort levels lie. The way that you view your own security might have changed, so your boundaries need to be updated as well. If something that you were once comfortable with is no longer okay with you, then think about telling the people in your life rather than silently bearing that burden. If they really love you, they won’t want to make you unnecessarily uncomfortable.","While your instincts are stronger today, your emotions are also running higher. You could find the right path for yourself and start to understand what makes you feel accomplished, only to find the opinions of others cause you to doubt what you originally wanted. The people you should surround yourself with are those who understand that your path doesn’t look like the cookie-cutter path that others would prescribe for you. Just take your time -- your victories are whatever makes you celebrate inside, not what helps you avoid judgment.","Your energy may be lower than usual today, so it’s okay to rest if you’ve been pushing yourself hard lately. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and the more you overwork yourself, the more rest you’ll have to catch up on later. It’s worth it to take the time now to rejuvenate rather than be forced into it when your body begins to crash. While your intentions may be noble, you can’t operate from an empty supply.","Although other people can help to fill your life, they can’t be the sole focus. You may find it easy to get lost in other people right now, especially those in need. While you may want to save everyone in your midst who’s needing help, it’s worth it to realize when you are letting your own needs slip. You shouldn't just drop everyone who depends on you, but don’t forget that you’re one of the people that needs your care and attention."
2021-06-25,"Imagination is important for visualizing the future we want, but we can’t run from reality when it makes itself clear. The fluctuating Moon's trine to rebellious Uranus asks us to see things from a different perspective, but Neptune Retrograde, beginning at 3:21 pm EDT, takes away a haze that was naturally there before. We may wish to put this haze back up on our own, but the Moon's sextile to Neptune makes it easier to accept and embrace reality instead of hiding or running away.","You may already be making slow and steady steps toward your long-term goals, and now, a pivot could be coming to help put you on a clearer path there. This will probably come from an unexpected place, like a dream or a stranger. When this out-of-the-blue opportunity presents itself, you’ll have to open your mind in order to see it for the good idea that it is. You may have a method that you’re not wanting to deviate from, but a little flexibility is necessary in order to grow.","Your social life can become suddenly clear to you now, changing your perceptions. Thankfully, this is likely to clear away negative images and open up positive relationships in a way that feels more genuine and connected. Someone may mention something in conversation that makes you rethink your previous ideas about someone else. If you’re not quite ready to reconcile with someone who hurt you, even if it was a misunderstanding, don’t forget that this is up to you. Take the time that you need.","Illusions and fears regarding your professional life can now begin to fade away. You may have been grappling with imposter syndrome and negative self-talk in the workplace, or with perceived disapproval from colleagues. An opportunity to feel appreciated and understood is likely to come for you now, helping to remove that doubt from your mind. However, if you’re noticing that harsh comments and a lack of thanks are more obvious, this might be your wake-up call to move on.","Friends come and go, and today, they may do either. You could run into an old friend that you haven’t seen in a while, or you might bid farewell to someone that you’re close to as they embark on the next chapter of their lives. While you’ll miss them after you part, it’s likely that this is an opportunity for you to meet new people or at least reconnect with people you haven’t seen in a while. Let ideas and plans carry the conversation.","Trust and loyalty are two qualities that are important in a friend, and through these, you may see who your friends are more clearly now. Don’t tell your secrets to everyone who will listen, because there are plenty of ears that want to hear just so they can use it for gossip fodder later. You may also learn of someone either upholding or betraying your trust now, depending on who you’ve put your trust in. Either way, what is revealed will show you where to put your faith.","You could start to see someone in your life for who they really are now, probably because they’re telling you straight up. You likely have known this person for a while, but you never knew this fact, and they may be choosing an odd time to reveal this about themselves. Whether it’s an embarrassing story or a strange hobby, try not to make them feel bad, unless it’s something truly harmful. Everyone has their quirks, even you!","There may have recently been a shift in your home environment that you’re still adjusting to, and you’re learning new information about this shift all the time. While it might still be unfamiliar territory, it’s beginning to feel more like a situation or a place that you can feel comfortable in. Do what you need to do to make it feel more inviting to you, because you’re allowed to take up space. Those who would have you shrink yourself must find a way to compromise.","What you focus on and what you distract yourself with is highlighted today. You may be either putting all of your focus on entertainment that stops you from paying attention to the more difficult situations in life, or you’re only focusing on your responsibilities and never allowing yourself to enjoy life. Both can lead you to isolate yourself, one inside of fun, and one inside of achievement. Talk it out with someone you love and get their perspective; it may be hard to see from the inside.","Although recent changes in your routine may have helped you to feel more safe and secure, self-sabotage might try to creep in today and destroy what you’ve worked so hard to create. Instead of allowing yourself to run back to old habits or people, remind yourself that your past comfort likely came with a price. Whether this price was your money, your health, or your peace of mind, it’s not worth giving that up for a trip down memory lane.","You'll need to think outside the box today, and quickly. If you need a good brainstorming session, this is the day to do it. You’re able to see things more clearly, where you may have previously been in a mental fog or had trouble focusing your thoughts. Transportation problems that have been a mystery may also expose themselves now. You’re meant to be looking at any problems head-on so that you’re able to fix the issues while you have this sense of clarity.","Financial abnormalities can surface today, and you may need to untangle them in order to reap the rewards. An unforeseen cost or a limited time offer might lighten your wallet unexpectedly, but you’ll probably be able to cover it without much of an issue. A family member or someone you live with may also make you aware of a change in their life that affects you positively, so be open to the news that they have to share.","An opportunity can arise for you within a group of people, but this may not be what you truly want inside. You aren't meant to be climbing professional ladders and making new friends now -- this is more of a time to learn about yourself. Take the opportunity to do what your gut is saying ""yes"" to and leave behind what your gut is saying ""no"" to. Even if it sounds like the right plan, check with your heart to see if it feels like the right plan, too."
2021-06-26,"It’s time to rid yourself of old feelings -- it’s OK to mourn their loss, but you can move on with life. Emotional energies are strong, as the sensitive Moon conjuncts destructive Pluto in a show that could bring forth turbulent emotions and unexpected assumptions. Later, the Moon opposes perfectionist Venus, asking for another dramatic display of emotions, rebelling against what’s expected of us. Finally, the Moon enters Aquarius at 10:09 am EDT, encouraging us to look to the future with new eyes and less emotional baggage.","Arguments with people of authority can turn out bad for both of you today. Watch out for emotional blowups in public and professional settings -- either your own blowups or someone else’s. You’re less likely to be afraid of the consequences now, particularly when you’re seeing red in the moment that someone makes you angry. Still, it’ll be worth it to hold your temper. You'll have a leg up in any argument if you can stay level-headed.","Someone may question what you believe today, provoking you to defend this subject without hesitation. However, before you end up fighting with someone over a special interest or your morals, ask yourself if the debate is worth what it will take from you. They might just be trying to get a rise out of you rather than actually wanting to learn anything. Resorting to verbal attacks is no way to display your core beliefs, so maintain your strength -- take a deep breath and look elsewhere for discussion.","Security, inside and out, is likely to be the focus of your day. Tension in your financial life or business partnerships can create issues, possibly leading to arguments or the need for a backup plan. It’s a poor time to sign contracts, but could be a good time to start dissolving them or dealing with sources of stress involving other people’s money. If you feel like someone is using money or power to control you, it may be time to encourage them to loosen their grip.","Public appearances -- whether in person or online -- could provoke messy emotional outbursts. You may feel torn between your inner self and how you want to be perceived, and both sides may influence each other while you try to keep control. Being prepared will help you, but maintaining a flawless appearance might be tricky to pull off at the moment. If you can, start the day by making sure you look and feel your best, and be ready to make improvements if need be.","If you hide your feelings, they won’t have the opportunity to be resolved, especially today. Putting on a brave face is noble, but repressing every painful emotion just means that one day they’re all going to burst out. You may feel as if you have too much to do to stop and acknowledge how you feel, but the truth is, you may actually be putting these feelings off because they’re uncomfortable. Look for a safe place to let out your emotions.","It’s cool to be different, but it can be difficult to be the odd one out. The social norms may not seem appealing to you now, and you might be more interested in subverting them to stand out from the crowd. However, it’s good to remember that everyone has different tastes -- just because something’s not for you doesn’t mean that it’s not for anyone. Make sure that you’re not alienating those who care about you by criticizing something that they may enjoy.","Situations from the past may return to create chaos, but you can be the calm in the eye of the storm. You might be sick of the gossip and complaints of your co-workers or other people you surround yourself with, or simply feel tired of your boss’ demanding attitude. Whatever it may be, you’re less likely to sit down, shut up, and take orders now. Still, it probably won’t benefit you to tell people off and leave in a huff; once you’re on your own, treat yourself for keeping your cool.","The words that come out of your mouth can make a real difference in the course of your day, or someone else's. What you say has an especially powerful effect right now, and you’re probably not interested in mincing words to preserve anyone's ego. Your wit is honed razor sharp, and this could make it easy to hurt someone's feelings while you're just trying to be funny. Even if the joke is right there, be thoughtful before you speak.","Letting go of old grudges may seem easier now, but the motivation to do so could be harder to find. Seeing a new photo or social media post of someone you used to know might spark some memories, taking you back to a time when you weren’t as strong or savvy. You may regret what happened back then, and you do not have to let this person back into your life now. Whether or not you want to reach out, it’ll be worth it to move on for yourself.","You may be influenced by obsession and intensity now, leading you to confuse others with strong statements or quick accusations. It would be best to avoid jumping to conclusions about other people, because your thoughts may be more black-and-white than normal. Consider the way you’re phrasing the things you want to say. While your words have a lot of power, the wrong words or tone may not receive the enthusiastic reaction that you’re really looking for from your audience.","Your health or energy may be wavering, especially if you are recovering from an especially demanding week. Allow yourself to catch up on your rest and don’t push yourself to do any extra activities today. You may find yourself indulging in nervous habits, so try to calm any anxiety by ensuring that you’re properly resting instead of stressing out while pretending to rest. Be honest with yourself about how much energy you have, and then react accordingly. Taking a break is good for you!","Friends could ask you to come out and play, but you may not be very interested in spending time with a group today. One-on-one time and solitude are probably more appealing to you, and group events that you do attend may feel somewhat chaotic; keep this in mind if you sign up for anything involving a number of people. Spending time with those you trust is key, so find the people who have your back and stick with them."
2021-06-27,"We can create stability by building something that will last. Beautiful Venus enters proud Leo today at 12:27 am EDT, evoking themes of ego and loyalty in our relationships. Then, the emotional Moon conjuncts steadfast Saturn, making us more serious about our feelings -- until the Moon’s later square to surprising Uranus brings an itching need to run from them. Thankfully, when the Moon trines communicative Mercury, we’ll have help to understand ourselves better, marrying our needs for both security and freedom.","New friendships could interfere with old ones, dividing your time and attention. While your latest connection might feel fresh and exciting to explore, the other friendships that you’ve worked so hard to cultivate don’t suddenly lose their meaning just because someone else has entered the picture. While it’s possible that there are bonds that have outlived their time in your life, make sure that you’re not just leaving them behind because you’re blinded by the excitement of someone new.","There may be something new about you now, and others could be trying to adjust to this new factor that you’ve added to your life. This might be a change in your look or your lifestyle, but either way, the people you know may find it hard to keep up with you. Make sure that you’re not making too drastic of a change without thinking about it first, because you might be tempted to make a hasty decision that you regret later.","Dishonesty can catch up to you quickly, even kind lies. It’s best to be truthful with yourself and with the other people in your life today, because trying to bend the truth can create problems that you don’t need. Try to avoid sweeping or generalizing statements, or else you could easily get tangled up in misunderstandings that would be hard for you to explain. It’s best to be honest -- even if it leads you to disagree with someone you care about.","Fears about the future could cause you to make a hasty decision in the present. Someone may have instigated this fear in you by telling you their own anxieties, but try to avoid allowing this worry to eat away at you. If you’re tempted to prepare for the worst by filling up your online shopping cart, ask yourself if you really need these items. Take a deep breath and, if you can, leave the checkout until tomorrow. You may not be so concerned in the morning.","Someone might be highly interested in bossing you around today, which may not sit well with you. You’re more likely to want a leadership role of your own, and seeing someone in this position who isn’t acting like a real leader could irritate you, especially if they’re wielding their power over you more than they need to. It’s okay to stand up to them, but you may want to wait until you have a cooler head -- then you can show them how a real leader works!","Confusion or sleepiness could sneak up on you if you’re running on empty! Old habits die hard, and letting bad habits prevent you from getting a good night’s rest can make the day more difficult than it would have been otherwise. Others should understand if you need some time alone or if you’re not able to stay out all night. You have a responsibility to yourself as much as you do to other people, and you won’t be able to pour from an empty cup.","Finding a dependable person to help you may be difficult at the moment, so you could find yourself taking on a challenge solo. Having to go it alone can be intimidating, but it’s worth it to trust in your own abilities and remember how far you’ve come. While the support of others would be ideal, sometimes you look around and there’s only you to deal with the problem. Roll up your sleeves and show everyone what you’re made of!","Changing loyalties may cause some upheaval today, and navigating the waters afterwards could be tricky. Friends or loved ones may fall out with each other, and while you won’t necessarily be included in the conflict, their disagreement might affect your social circle by proxy. Instead of feeling like you need to choose a side, let those more directly involved decide how they wish to deal with their feelings. Be there for them both if that’s an option, but try to avoid choosing one person to back.","A judgmental attitude can take over today without you even realizing. You may find yourself picking apart other people in your mind -- or even out loud -- only to realize later that you were being a little harsh. While what you were thinking or saying may have been true, you likely wouldn’t want that kind of criticism focused on you. Try not to nitpick other people over insignificant details or mistakes, because being able to live and let live will be much more peaceful for everyone involved.","People may approach you looking for generosity today, but you might not be in a very giving mood. Instead of trying to pinch every penny you’ve got in your wallet, give kindness a chance when you have an opportunity to help someone. While there are always people out there who need help, it may not be often that there's an individual right in front of you who has an immediate need. Ultimately, don’t give what you can’t afford, but it won’t hurt to share what you can.","Self-criticism and procrastination can be your biggest enemies right now, and they could slow you down if you’re not aware of their influence. You may have a deadline and feel unsure of how to complete your best work in the amount of time available. While trying to deliver an amazing product is admirable, you don’t need to be absolutely perfect. Go ahead and finish that first draft and then celebrate your progress, instead of expecting yourself to do it flawlessly the first time.","Miscommunication can cause issues today -- luckily, genuine heart-to-hearts can solve most of them. Clear statements will serve you better than indirect metaphors, but even if you don’t say the right thing, your heart is probably in the right place. Spend time with the people who understand you even if you can’t find the right words to express yourself. Your greatest supporters are those who are willing to stick around and make an effort to understand what you really mean to say."
2021-06-28,"Good intentions and spiritual alignment can help us connect with our inner selves today. When the sensitive Moon enters empathetic Pisces, we stop living in the future and being detached from the now, and instead move into a place where we can enjoy the present moment and enjoy ourselves as we are. The Moon quickly moves into a conjunction with expansive Jupiter at 5:33 pm EDT, providing us with a pleasant sense of optimism and comfort to last us through the evening.","Your dreams from last night may be lingering in your mind today, as well as your dreams for the future. This is a good time for you to tune in to your inner needs by paying attention to the symbolism of your dreams. After you woke up this morning, what stuck with you? The people who appeared, the places you went, and the feelings that you felt are all pieces of the puzzle when it comes to discerning what your subconscious is trying to tell you about your waking life.","Look at lucky you! Good fortune is following you and could connect you with people who can help you in the future and improve your life in general. You may feel instinctually led to go somewhere that you don’t normally frequent, or to call someone that you haven’t spoken to in a while. Follow your intuition. You’re quite likely to improve the luck of whomever you choose to spend your day with as well, so choose the people who bless your life, and bring a blessing to them.","You may be able to get to the next rung on the professional or public ladder now. Superiors are more likely to say yes when you ask for a day off or new responsibilities, as long as you keep your requests within reason. Your reputation can be elevated if you’re willing to express your fun and optimistic side, and others will be thankful for the positive energy that you are naturally able to exude. Let your smile pave the way to your success.","Sometimes the most direct way to increase your income is to learn a new skill or become well-versed in a certain subject. Education is a boon to you right now, and you may be offered a free class or an opportunity to listen to an interesting speaker. Not only could this be intriguing in the moment, but this knowledge could also help you later on. Although you could fritter the day away in la-la-land, why not take advantage of a chance to expand the options for your future self?","When you put down real roots, you’re often rewarded with security. Someone may bring you an opportunity today to invest, and while it’s not recommended that you invest more than you’ll miss from your bank account, you’re more likely to bet on a winner right now. While it can be tempting to get caught up in the high of seeing a positive return and want to spend more, make sure that you’re not jeopardizing your current stability for a chance at improving your future stability.","Love makes the world go round, and today, it could make your world a little richer. Your close relationships with others can bring you good fortune, either through a gift that you may not have been expecting or through brightening your spirits with laughter and kindness. The people in your life are more likely to be in a good mood, and they want to share this good mood with you in order to spread the love around. Your mission today is to embrace joy.","Good habits may finally start to pay off for you now. If you’ve been consistent with eliminating a bad habit or following a healthier diet, even small changes are likely to make themselves known. If you’re ready to make some changes but haven’t actually sat down to figure out how to implement them, you can take advantage of this time to prioritize your wellness and drop what’s holding you back. Appreciate your body for getting you this far by giving back to it -- you deserve to feel good!","Fortune favors the brave, and your bravery is no exception. A boosted sense of confidence and the ability to think outside the box can help you stand out from the crowd today. Others are more likely to take notice of your creative mind as well. Instead of hiding yourself from the spotlight, allow yourself to be a competitor in a race that you know you deserve to be a part of. Even if you fall short of first place, chances are you impressed someone who’s now paying attention.","We all need someone to lean on sometimes, and the people who feel like home to you are your greatest allies now. Supportive words and actions may come from unexpected places. Even though the people coming to your aid were likely there for you in the past, you may have thought that they were staying in the past. Fortunately, their generosity is likely to come with a serving of dreamy nostalgia and hilarious inside jokes you may have forgotten. Let in the love.","It’s time to use your words and speak up for what you deserve. Moving around in the background and saying nothing will keep you in the background, which isn’t a bad place to be, as long as you’re being compensated in a way that satisfies you. However, if you’re looking to improve your situation and don’t want to stay in the same place forever, let someone know how you’re feeling. While it can be hard to open up, a closed mouth doesn’t get fed.","It’s easier to keep your momentum going when you feel secure, and thankfully, you’re able to plant both feet firmly on the ground right now. Without as much chaos or uncertainty to deal with, you have more time and focus to pursue new financial opportunities. You could feel comfortable going after what you really want for once, rather than just reaching for whatever you think is available to you. Elevate your standards and you may find that the world rises to meet them.","You’re shining your own unique light, and there are people who can amplify it for you if you let them. Although you may not able to receive or rely on the advice of others right now, you can make your own path and find that it ends up right where you want it to. This freedom would be intimidating to some, but you’re no stranger to standing apart. You’re making your own luck right now, so follow what feels right to you!"
2021-06-29,"Not every accomplishment needs to be broadcast to the entire world. Our egos and hearts are more in tune with each other as the emotional Moon trines the confident Sun. However, we must be open to change, since the Moon’s sextile to revolutionary Uranus insists on inner growth. While we might be proud of this change, we could speak too soon and jinx our progress when the Moon squares communicative Mercury at 11:00 pm EDT. Let the world wait on our good news.","Spending habits can make or break your financial success, and someone may be in your ear telling you how to spend your money. Whether or not they mean well, odds are that the business advice you’re currently receiving from them isn’t necessarily going to fill up your bank account like you’d prefer. Stick to the safer economic routes for now, and avoid reckless spending or shaky investments. What you have in hand is likely worth too much to risk it.","A change of appearance may be in order, but make sure that you’re not going off the deep end of luxury. You’re in danger of coming up with a fashionable new vision for yourself that could include designer clothing and an expensive haircut, but you may want to pick one and save the rest to update later. Even if you wake up this morning and feel like you’re behind on the latest trends, that’s better than being late on paying your bills!","A brand-new fascination may be coming for you, and it could be shocking! While you’re likely no stranger to switching up your mindset when your circumstances start feeling stale, you could be hesitant to embrace this interest that you didn’t predict for yourself. Be like water and allow this new perspective to flow into your life. In the future you'll be able to look back and see why this had to happen, so don’t resist your blessings now while they’re still in disguise.","A new person could enter your friend group at this time, and you may not be prepared for the different dynamic that they bring. It’s intriguing when someone just shows up and becomes a part of your life, but you might not always be enthusiastic about the facts you learn about them. Even if you feel suspicious of this person’s motives at first, give them a chance to grow on you. You never know who could be your best friend down the road!","Your workplace could get shaken up for you, and you may need to adjust to fresh responsibilities. Thankfully, other tasks that you currently have are likely to fall to the wayside as you learn the new tricks of the trade. You may be getting a promotion, making a lateral move, or even be asked to help redecorate the office, if your job has one. Whatever this role may be, embrace it and evolve with it -- there's no benefit in clinging to the past.","An opportunity to go somewhere you've never been or to learn something new could be presented to you, but uncertainty can get in your way. This might feel like a risky move for you, and you may be worried about how it could affect your reputation. While you do run the risk of being embarrassed, this is just how putting yourself out there feels usually. Try remembering a time when you resisted something new, and how good it turned out once you bit the bullet and did it anyway!","Your loyalties may be changing, even if you’re not prepared to move on just yet. Someone you admire could hold opinions that you don’t share, and this can be difficult to reconcile, especially if you feel you have a moral obligation to this opinion. Even after questioning them, this person might insist on a point of view that sours your perception of them. Potential for growth may be there, but recognize that they will have to make it real with true change.","The balance between caring too much and being completely detached is crucial. Now may be the time to take a different approach to those you care about -- but be sure you don't end up swinging too far in the other direction! That could make their heads spin just as much as the original approach. Just because someone has made their boundaries clear to you or asked you to accommodate them in a different way, don’t take that as your cue to entirely change who you are.","Other people may try to infringe on your personal progress, despite your best efforts. You might have recently made a personal change that you’re proud of, but someone or even multiple people could miss the old you and try to force you back into that box. Just like a snake can’t fit into its shed skin, you won’t feel right trying to shove yourself back into a persona that no longer fits you. Be who you are -- there’s no point in trying to fake it.","Activities that used to bring you joy may not fit into your current routine. You might have switched to a new schedule that doesn’t work with those pastimes, or even moved locations and now you’re too far away from your original hangout spots. Now, an enjoyable new place or activity may become available to you, and even though it’s not the same, you’re not in the same place either. Let your joys and pleasures evolve with the rest of you.","An old memory might change today in the light of new information. Did it really happen the way you remember it, or have your memories evolved to fit your feelings? You may not have had access to the full picture at the time, but now you could have found a missing piece of the puzzle -- one that you might not have even known existed before. Instead of hanging on to your memories, sit with this realization and see if it can help give you closure.","Oversensitivity to the opinions of others can lead you down an unwanted path if you aren’t careful. Someone may set you off with their words, but whether or not they meant to hurt you, it’s not worth it to verbally retaliate. Before you hit back with your own cutting remarks, make sure that you’re not about to say something that you’ll regret later. There’s nothing wrong with speaking from the heart, just make sure that your heart is in the right place first."
2021-06-30,"Confusion and a lack of direction can give way to ambition and aim by the end of the day. Our emotions might run away with us as the sensitive Moon conjuncts nebulous Neptune and leads us down an emotionally hazy or aimless path. However, the Moon's sextile to transformative Pluto forces us to find a way to create light in our own darkness. Finally, the Moon enters Aries at 9:21 am EDT, allowing a clear finish line to come into view, so we can head straight for it.","The time to fret over what's happening in your life is done -- you’re now able to see what’s truly available to you, where it might have been obscured before. This may be a job that's finally opening up, a love interest making their intentions clear, or even a more well-defined understanding of what you want out of life. What used to be just out of reach could now be right in front of you -- the question is how you’ll choose to seize this moment.","It's okay to admit if you’re not feeling quite so social anymore. You may be tired of visiting every new socially-distanced place in the city or trying out countless online activities, and now you want to connect with your inner self to understand your true feelings. While this can be difficult to explain to those around you, it’s wise to take the time to recharge when your body and mind need it. Tune into your inner voice and allow yourself a quiet environment to listen.","Your career may be difficult to navigate right now. The day could start with mishaps in the workplace or miscommunications between yourself and an authority figure, and the best course of action likely won’t make itself obvious. Try to go with the flow and use your head as you make judgment calls on the fly. Thankfully, your friends probably have some good advice and reassuring words to help to get any lingering stress off your mind once you’ve clocked out.","Be prepared for roadblocks as you make your way through life today. Your usual route is not likely to go smoothly, which could leave you stewing in frustration as you long to move forward. These delays can be metaphorical or literal -- you may experience blocked progress in work or school or be forced to sit in a long line or traffic jam. However it manifests, a healthy dose of patience will help take the sting out of having to wait.","Someone’s silence could cause you to wonder what's really going on. You may reach out to someone today only to receive no response, but whether or not you get a reply by the end of the day, your mission is to not spiral into worry. Be wary of getting caught up in hypothetical worst-case scenarios, because they’re likely all in your head. Remember that worries are imaginary until they receive confirmation, so why provide yourself with that unnecessary fear?","Relationships and friendships can be tricky at the moment, especially if miscommunication gets in your way. You may find yourself saying the right thing but with the wrong words, and then having to backtrack to keep out of trouble. It’s easy to both misinterpret and be misinterpreted now, so if you feel like what someone else said was weird or out of character, chances are you didn’t hear them right. Before you get irritated with anyone, give them an opportunity to explain.","Several responsibilities may have been piled on you, and they have likely gotten so heavy that you didn’t realize how much of your time the work takes up. While it is kind of you to volunteer to help people, getting lost in taking care of others can cause you to neglect your own life. Bring back balance by spending quality time with someone you truly care about -- preferably over something that won’t exhaust you further, because all work and no play can lead to burnout in the long run.","Motivation might be very difficult to find, and mustering any energy to get work done could be doubly draining. Even if you are normally a hard worker, the events of yesterday may have sapped your stamina and left you wanting to lie around all day today. Relaxing can be therapeutic, but if you completely neglect your work, you’ll likely regret it in the future. The sooner you get your responsibilities out of the way, the sooner you can take that nap.","Events that stir up memories can cause you to feel stuck in the past. Someone you used to know might come back into your life today, dredging up old thoughts. Whether you find yourself nostalgic for wonderful times from bygone days, or holding grudges over negative experiences from back then, try to find your peace with these memories and don’t dwell on them. This is even more important if they’re preventing you from living the life you have now.","Although you may normally be on the up-and-up, you could feel unusually tempted into lying right now. Even if it feels simpler to tell a tall tale in the heat of the moment, falsehoods are likely to come back to bite you very quickly. Someone may respond to your statement with a question that requires you to know details that you didn’t cook up with the rest of your story, so stick to honesty and you'll always have the right answer.","Something that you thought was a safe bet could turn out to be more of a gamble than you initially thought. You may have had high hopes for the return on your investment, only to find out that you or someone else had mixed up a few of the details and created a difficult situation through a lack of preparedness or understanding. The road to stability can be a foggy one, so move slowly to handle the curves up ahead.","An obscured sense of self-awareness may lead you to underestimate or overestimate yourself now. Even if you’re normally aware of how you come across, what was once clearly your persona might not be so obvious to you today. The people around you will likely let you know where you misstepped right away, and they may not be very gentle. Try not to act out or confront others if possible, so that you can avoid potential embarrassment or confusion about your reactions."
2021-07-01,"Our ability to assert our individual needs is squelched by the structures of society as fiery Mars opposes cold Saturn at 9:08 am EDT. The sensitive Moon interacts harmoniously with both Mars and Saturn, so being aware of our emotional responses can give us a way around this difficult conflict. The help comes with strings attached, however, as the Moon also squares the Sun in nurturing Cancer. We may wonder which is more stifling: an openly stern authority figure, or the pressure to be kind.","You are more in touch with your emotions today, and they are working harmoniously with your ability to assert yourself. Though you may find yourself going in a direction different from how you were raised, you can find support from a community you are part of now. Of course, your current community has standards and limitations of its own. Remembering the restrictions of your upbringing can help guard you against hypocrisy in that regard -- you would not want to exchange one variety of harshness for another.","You want to shape your family structure or home life to meet your own unique needs, but you may feel held back by expectations from people in positions of power. Whoever you are afraid of may be less powerful than you think they are, so this is a good day to unpack what is really holding you back. There might be a part of you that is ambivalent about change, but talking with someone about what comes up for you emotionally could help you move forward.","You may be eager to put your views out there today, only to run into the buzz saw of pesky fact-checkers. Someone else could try to mediate the ensuing conflict in a way that is actually helpful to you, but you may be so upset about perceived threats to your deeply held values that you can’t see the help. Instead of assuming you know what other people’s views are, try to stay focused on what they are actually saying in the moment.","You could be looking to improve your financial situation, yet you feel held back by your obligations to someone else. It may even be yourself that you feel obligated to, wanting to uphold your self-image as someone who is caring and nurturing. You don't necessarily need to be more aggressive to get ahead professionally. Keep in mind that others may not be holding you to the lofty standards you impose on yourself, so do what is necessary to protect and care for yourself.","Although you may want to assert yourself now, you could feel restricted by one of your close relationships. If the other person is overstepping boundaries -- or if you are the one out of line -- turning together to a shared philosophy may help mediate the conflict. Even if it turns out that you need to back off, you will feel good about being in-line with the rules. Within this structure, you may also gain perspective on your own more subtle motivations.","You might feel held back by all of your responsibilities right now, and you don’t feel like you can ask for help openly. Therefore, you may be tempted to manipulate others through your martyrdom. What might be more effective, though, is looking at how your peers handle similar situations. Those who are supposed to be sharing responsibilities with you could be influenced to step up if you are able to calmly and directly show them that this is common practice for others in their place.","Asserting yourself in a community you belong to may make you aware of the limits on how much you can really express yourself there. You might be trying to sort out your life direction now, and you need a sounding board who will give you the space you need to do that. Not everyone is capable of meeting this need for you, but you might be able to cultivate individual relationships within this community that feel freer and more supportive than the larger group.","You may feel like your responsibilities at home are blocking you from moving toward your personal ambitions. If you write down a list of everything you actually need to do to satisfy these responsibilities, though, it might not look like very much. The issue could not be so much the tasks themselves as it is the way you think about them. Your domestic life may seem less oppressive if you can find a healthier lens to view it through.","Your intellectual life is exciting today, but you might find yourself uncharacteristically quiet. You want to make sure you completely understand what you are learning before you try to talk to others about it, because being misunderstood would really throw a wet blanket on your joy. You may also be drawn to studying the sort of intense topics that can spark conflict if people aren’t in the right space for them. Focusing on your own pleasure and transformation is enough for now.","You may need to collaborate with someone close on an issue of shared space or other joint property today. The other person might have more passion for moving forward, so you could be cast in the role of the heavy, slowing things down. Even if you feel unfairly pushed, take an honest look at the situation to see if your fears are really justified. If you can agree to the basic idea, your attention to detail can be helpful in sorting out the finer points.","Someone close to you could be pushing you and irritating you today, and you might have to tell them how you feel before you explode. Looking at your own role in the conflict is probably necessary, too. Even if you see yourself as the responsible one who is concerned with the practical details of the situation, you may actually be so paralyzed by the details that you have no idea how to move forward. Your conversation will be more productive if you are able to be honest about that.","You may not be aware of certain structures or limitations in your life, but that does not mean they are not there. Pay attention to the subtle things that come up today as you attend to your routine responsibilities. You might have simply accepted these limitations because they are in line with values that you hold. However, if you feel that your individual freedom is overly suppressed, you will tend to get in your own way by continually rebelling. Adapt your structure to one that is realistic for your life."
2021-07-02,"Even if we can’t heal our wounds today, they can still be a source of strength. Assertive Mars forms a harmonious trine with sensitive Chiron at 4:41 am EDT, empowering us to address our emotional needs. The nurturing Moon chats with communicative Mercury as the day continues, so we will be able to explain to ourselves and others where a little TLC could be used in our lives. Talking might be easier than listening, so remember to take turns.","You may be more open than usual with the people you encounter in your daily routine. Even if some of these people are just acquaintances at this point, sharing about yourself can help build foundations for deeper relationships over time. Your sore spots might be on your mind, but you don’t have to unpack all of that just yet. Simply finding a way to have fun with others can give you the feelings of inclusion and support that you need.","Your mind could be stuck on your money and other material resources today. If you feel like you don’t have enough, you might need to look for any mental blocks that are holding you back from either increasing your income or realizing that you already have more than you think you do. Rearranging your physical space could stimulate your thought process and help you see your finances from a fresh perspective. The truth is probably hiding in plain sight.","Communicating on social media or in your larger community could get intense today. You might push too hard on a sensitive point for someone else, or they could do the same to you. To minimize the potential for conflict, stay as focused as you can on communicating your own personal experiences without using them as grounds to speculate or make assumptions about the experiences of others. Your story is powerful, but you need to maintain a sense of where it begins and ends.","The cosmos offers insight into your motivations today, so it makes sense to ask yourself about your rationale -- specifically, why you might feel driven to make more money lately. The current push could turn out to be rooted in the desire to prove yourself to some authority figure, possibly one from earlier in your life. That does not necessarily mean your ambition is wrong, but make sure it’s realistic for your current circumstances. Knowing why you’re doing this will help you do it better.","Asserting yourself is not always easy, but it will become easier when you feel like you’re acting in harmony with your moral code. Your community can help you clarify your ideals, giving you honest but kind feedback on how well you are living up to them. However, you sometimes love popularity contests too much for your own good, so keep hold of your capacity for personal judgment. Remember that people who are worth respecting will respect you for doing the right thing.","An authority figure may be able to help you unsnarl some shared responsibilities if things have gotten out of hand. Talking directly to the person who shares these responsibilities with you might be unappealing, so the outside perspective will be helpful. Prepare to handle the issue by trying to get as much clarity as you can on your motivations. If you can be honest about your own difficulties, that should inspire the other person to be more candid about their end of the problem.","Close relationships may feel intense for you right now, but you are able to make logical sense of what’s going on and create a plan to fix any problems. One way to rejuvenate a companionship that is going through a rough patch could be to join a new community together. Watching your friend or partner make new connections with others might refresh your memory of why you found them intriguing in the first place. Working together can help you get the good times back.","Health issues could be on your mind today, whether or not you have a known medical condition -- they might be especially interesting if you don’t. Instead of jumping to conclusions over every little twinge, try to look at any vague symptoms in a more detached way. They may not come from your body, but rather from emotions you have trouble expressing. You’re now more equipped than usual to articulate the secret or darker side of your life, and doing so can help you feel better physically and emotionally.","You may need to tell someone in a close relationship that you feel like your needs for individual expression are not being met. At this point, your feelings of being wounded -- whether or not they have anything to do with the current situation -- might have accumulated to a point where it becomes easy to get lost in them. For everyone’s benefit, try to stay focused on an achievable goal for how you want this relationship to be structured here and now.","Family baggage might feel extra heavy today, but luckily, the planets are sending you the energy to probe any tough or taboo wounds. You’ll have an advantage if there is practical work involved, like cleaning a space or organizing papers -- seeing artifacts could trigger your memories and answer unresolved questions. The act of discarding unneeded items may also help you make similar judgments on an emotional level. What do you want to keep from your past and what should you leave behind?","Conversation could get heavy in a close relationship today. The other person might initiate a big talk, and you may not be happy about it at first. You are likely more capable than usual of articulating your side of the story, though, so the outcome could be better for you than you might think. This is an ideal opportunity to reconfigure the relationship so that both of you get your individual needs met. The more open you can be, the better.","You may feel insecure about your finances today, but this could motivate you to focus on how you can earn more at work. Even though that can end up beneficial, you could also use a pep talk from your family or the people you live with. Beyond making you feel better emotionally, they can also help you see financial possibilities that you might have overlooked. You could already have more resources than you think. Don’t be afraid to reach out to those around you for support."
2021-07-03,"Anything that has been suppressed for too long could pop out like a jack-in-the-box today. The willful Sun tangles awkwardly with authoritarian Saturn, producing a heavy vibe. Limits will be trampled, however, when flamboyant Mars shoves individualist Uranus into a triggering square at 9:40 pm EDT. Nothing is too wild for these two planets right now! Meanwhile, the lovely Moon and lucky Jupiter form a fortunate sextile. However crazy things seem in the moment, good can ultimately come out of the chaos.","Secret or unexpected help with a money issue could come to you today, but it might be challenging to hold on to any financial boost. Opportunities to spend on something fun and frivolous seem to pop up everywhere. Try to wait out the temptations -- and don’t let family or peers tell you how to spend your money, either. Just keep the situation to yourself for now, and remember that a lot of money decisions do not need to be made instantaneously.","Even if you want to make your home a greater reflection of your personal identity, the aggressive way you might go about it today is likely to agitate whomever you live with. Go as wild as you want if you live alone, or try to confine your focus to a private space if you live with others. Once you've spent time rejuvenating your environment, connecting with friends can improve your mood further and give you more inspiration.","Strange words or contradictions may come out of your mouth by surprise today. This is likely due to some tension between what you believe and what you make important in real life. Even if you’re embarrassed or worried about the consequences of this sentiment slipping free, you may be pleasantly surprised to discover that others agree -- an authority figure in particular might be impressed by what you express. These people see the same things you do, but may not have your gift for articulating them.","Peer pressure may encourage you to take a risk with money today. Consider the specific source, though -- if you feel like the particular person or group in question feeds your intellectual side, the opportunity they are offering might be a good one. Accessing ideas that you might not think of on your own is a perk of having other people in your life. Whatever you decide, make sure you only risk your own money, and not funds that you share with anyone else.","Someone in a significant relationship may be pressuring you to deepen your commitment, but you might feel resistance that is hard to articulate. Whether you’re linked for business, friendship, or love, you might fear that letting yourself get tied down will limit your professional horizons. It can be hard to find the right balance between pursuing new opportunities and getting more out of your existing connections, but make sure that any arrangements you’re considering add more to your life than they take away.","Although you may have some obligations today to a group or community you have been part of for a long time, a new relationship could provide you with more compelling intellectual stimulation. Unfortunately, circumstances might place the two in conflict with each other. Whatever you choose, try to be honest at least with yourself about what you are choosing and why. If you don’t make a conscious choice, the decision could be taken out of your hands in a way you won’t like. Don't give up your free will.","Unexpected events may throw your social network into upheaval today, and since you probably prefer things to be orderly and predictable, you could take this harder than others. Though you might not be able to control everything as much as you’d like, your ongoing attention to the needs of those you care about gives them some underlying stability regardless of current events. Embrace this quality now, because people are watching and someone could offer you a new opportunity on account of it.","A close relationship could help you today, making you feel seen and heard. In this nurturing atmosphere, you can gain a new understanding of your professional ambitions or life direction. These insights might focus on making more room for your individuality or creative freedom. However, they might also come with a struggle to fit them into your view of the world, especially if the messages you received growing up were very different. Taking the first step of action toward any new goals will clarify things more quickly.","Even if the world is calling your name, you may feel stuck at home now. Happily, even if you cannot go on a journey of the magnitude you would like, you are equipped to make serious progress toward beautifying your immediate surroundings. You are known for loving to learn without worrying about concrete achievements, and today you can learn a lot from traveling into the forgotten drawers and closets of your own residence. Decluttering your home could provide you with a surprisingly transformative experience.","You could feel protective of your money or property, but sharing your resources seems to be the price of admission for a close relationship. If you feel like you are being pushed into something without getting a say in it, you might snap at the other person. Try to talk to them about your concerns before you reach that point. Fortunately, you’re more articulate about your individual needs than usual, so you should at least do a good job telling your side of the story.","Relationships at home may be full of surprises today. Even if some of the surprises are good ones, you might feel irritated, as you are trying to stay focused on your normal routine and the things that you think need to be done. You had a plan for the day, and this is not it. On the other hand, a financial bonus or an item from your wish list could emerge as a welcome treat. Try to go with the flow as much as you can.","Your identity may have been shifting and expanding lately, and today you have the ability to confidently share an updated version of yourself with the people around you. Some of them may be surprised, but they will probably take it better than you expect. Your harshest critic might just be yourself! Focusing on your routine responsibilities can help you gain a better perspective and realize that most people are more interested in their own lives than in critiquing yours."
2021-07-04,"Fireworks are likely today as the Moon in usually placid Taurus tangles with explosive Uranus and Mars. The things we take for granted might just blow up. The trigger for the explosions, however, could be our own sensitive sides demanding attention, as the Sun squares wounded Chiron at 11:39 am EDT. If we make an effort to be aware of the emotional needs of those around us, we may be able to use the day’s intense energy for productive breakthroughs rather than senseless destruction.","Your usual confidence may waver today as you feel more vulnerable and in need of acceptance. You could particularly feel that your family falls short of meeting these needs for you, especially if your values are different from theirs. You may be ready to aggressively defend your principles at any opportunity, however, you could make surprising progress if you focus on giving others a safe space to open up about their wounds. Some people who seem harsh are not any kinder to themselves than they are to you.","People near you like neighbors or siblings could drive you crazy today, and you might be the one who seems unhinged as you defend your turf. Is the issue really what these people did, though, or did the incident somehow reopen old wounds? It may be hard for you to talk productively about what is bothering you in the moment because you might not feel very in-the-moment now -- you may be drifting in and out of your past. Wait until you feel more grounded before you confront anyone.","You could be feeling a little isolated these days, especially if you have a sense that your social network doesn't share some of your most important values. It may seem difficult to bridge this divide, but an unusual approach can help you find unexpected common ground with others. Instead of getting into philosophical topics and debating about things you don't agree on, try telling people about a wild dream you had recently. When you surprise people, they may surprise you back.","Peer pressure may encourage you to take a risk with money today. Consider the specific source, though -- if you feel like the particular person or group in question feeds your intellectual side, the opportunity they are offering might be a good one. Accessing ideas that you might not think of on your own is a perk of having other people in your life. Whatever you decide, make sure you only risk your own money, and not funds that you share with anyone else.","Conflict between you and an authority figure could escalate out of hand today. They may be convinced that the law is on their side, but from your perspective, they might be enforcing the rules in an arbitrary or inconsistent way. Or, perhaps there is something inhumane about the rules themselves, and now you feel inclined to call them on it. Still, no matter how much this person may deserve to be told off, make sure you are able to live with the consequences.","Your intellectual explorations may have taken an unusual turn lately, perhaps even into things that your social circle would consider taboo. If you have not filled those people in on the changes in your life, just interacting with them might feel like a covert spy mission. You do not have to spill everything today if you are not ready for it, but listen to your own intuition about whether you see yourself staying with this crowd long-term.","There could be some conflict today between a close relationship and your personal ambitions. First, look at whether your current arrangement of sharing resources in the relationship is part of the problem. While collaborating can be helpful if everyone involved truly wants to see you succeed, you can wind up sabotaged if either you or the other person has some ambivalence about your goals. You may not be able to get inside everyone’s head, but you can see what is and is not working now.","An important relationship in your life may be disruptive and unsettling today. You might feel especially disappointed if the other person is unreliable, leaving you with more responsibilities than you think is fair. You cannot control anyone else, but finding a different way to understand what has landed on you could make your obligations more bearable. There could be more to the story than you see at first. Even if you are unable to count on others, you can feel proud that you can always count on yourself.","Shared responsibilities could blow up into a major conflict today, especially if one more addition to your to-do list reminds you that everything seems to be all on you. The conflict might be a good thing in the long run, as it could make clear to everyone what needs resolving. Once you get their attention, you are able to work with others constructively. You can see the big picture clearly now, so channel your motivation into developing a plan that respects the needs of every individual involved.","What starts out as fun could cross the line into danger today. If you know you are going to be taking a risk, try to clarify in advance who is responsible if something goes wrong. Trying to sort things out after an accident has already happened may lead to conflict that damages relationships and becomes a long-lasting problem. The people around you may seem to be looking for opportunities to place blame on others, so play it as safe as you can.","Relationships at home could be infuriating for you today. It may be hard for you to get your point across when you try to communicate about routine household responsibilities, leading you to feel hurt or misunderstood on top of whatever the original problem was. You can empower yourself, however, by making an intentional choice about which is more important to you: solving the problem or feeling understood. Taking the time to unsnarl an emotional knot could be worth giving your to-do list the day off.","You may want to have fun today, but just the idea of having to stick to a budget could set you off. If you cannot afford all the pleasures you want, you might feel bad about yourself or get jealous of others who appear to have more. Conversation may be very stimulating, though, and that is usually free. Interesting people could be lurking in the most routine and mundane corners of your life, so be open to opportunities for excitement there."
2021-07-05,"Today is the sunshine after the rain, though the Sun in the gentle sign of Cancer does not shine too aggressively. It makes a supportive sextile with creative Uranus at 3:14 pm EDT, facilitating just the right amount of individual expression. Change is possible without chaos. Meanwhile, the Moon interacts harmoniously with both intuitive Neptune and transformative Pluto. As our individual desires seem to align with large forces in the collective, we can have faith that we are part of something much bigger than ourselves.","Taking initiative with money matters could go well for you today. Whatever you want to do is in harmony with both your own secret dreams and the unspoken rules of society, so your intentions powerfully align with your actions. Authority figures might be on your side, even if they are not loud about it. Your family could also come through for you in a way you do not expect. Have the confidence to try something new knowing that support is all around you.","When you talk, people tend to listen because they hear something bigger. While you may not be directly quoting the great thinkers in your field or community, you may have digested the most important points of their teachings well enough that you can say them in your own way. Your words are grounded in the goings on of your immediate world, but they carry subtle notes of something more profound. What you have to say may truly resonate with others now.","There may be a part of you that values a secure life because going against the grain would interfere with your ability to connect with just about anyone. Today, though, the part of you that wants to dig into dark or secret matters may be louder than usual. You can be rebellious and still be confident -- the less shocked you are by your wild side, the less shocking others will find it. Your battle may be more with your own idea of decorum than it is with anyone else.","Someone you have been in a close friendship or relationship with for a while could introduce you to a larger community today where you really feel like you have room to be yourself. You may have a sense that these people share your view of the world, though the specifics might not be discussed in a lot of detail. Even if there is nothing too dramatic about your first meeting, the connections you develop with individuals in this group can become more significant over time.","Your quietly determined work ethic can help you meet your professional goals, and your sensitivity to subtle power dynamics might be important for this task, too. While you may want to be at the top of your field someday, having a realistic sense of where you are in the hierarchy right now is necessary for you to identify what your next steps should be. You can work behind the scenes when you have a clear sense of what you are doing there.","One of the challenges of changing your views on life is that you may feel alone in the process. If you finally meet someone else who is on the same journey you are, it's easy to let your heart burst open for them. In the long run, it can be hard to tell the difference between genuinely connecting with this person and idealizing them. Today, though, it is fine to just enjoy experiencing whatever you have with them without worrying about the details.","Your attention to your routine responsibilities at home can be rewarding on an exceptionally deep level today. Use your intuition to connect with the subtle vibes of your space and discern what really needs cleaning or decluttering. The path you clear may not be just physical. As the transformative flow of energy moves through you, you have the potential to burst through blocks that kept you from clarity on your major life goals. You might like things to be rational, but this could get emotional.","You can communicate within a close relationship today in a style that addresses important issues without beating the other person over the head with them. You don't have to loudly demand your own way because seeing the bigger picture could be more rewarding for you now. When you put it like that, the other person may even become eager to go on an exciting intellectual journey with you. Your needs are not the declared destination, but they are likely to be met as stops along such a path.","Although an innovation you make in your chores at home or routine tasks at work may come from you wanting to save money, this change could turn out to have a more significant and positive impact than you expect. Your focus might be on the more mundane parts of your life right now rather than the larger world, yet you are able to get things humming harmoniously there. This will give you a secure foundation now, and for whatever exploring you do in the future.","You may have to initiate a significant conversation today, but go into it assuming the best about the other person instead of approaching them as an adversary. Even though you might need to ask them for more freedom to meet your individual needs, you are able to say this in a kind way. Instead of feeling like you have to push for every little thing, you could find that the dialogue just flows and that the other person also feels liberated by the exchange. Stay focused on a positive outcome.","You may find you have more faith in money today than usual. You trust that things will work out, especially when it comes to a home or family matter, and they very well could. There might be a hidden source of help you can access, although you should look to see whether it comes with strings attached. Either way, you also need to put in your own sweat equity toward your goal, and that can provide some stability and control amid the more speculative parts of the equation.","You can communicate powerfully in your community today. Though you may be the one speaking up, you are likely advocating for something bigger than yourself. People can see that you have the best interests of the group in mind, and they will likely support what you are saying. They might also see your capability for a leadership position that you would not have thought of on your own, so get ready to back up your words with action."
2021-07-06,"If we want to be told the truth today, we need to be seen as people who can handle the truth. We may feel afraid of losing love as we build up to vulnerable Venus' challenging opposition to stern Saturn at 10:36 pm EDT. The crafty Moon in Gemini can help us see a way around our problems, but trickster Mercury's provocative square to deceptive Neptune tempts us to spin reality into what we think others want to hear. Illusions may seem ideal, but honesty will take us further.","Communication may not be completely rational for you right now. You might be feeling very intuitive and imaginative, but this doesn’t always translate well in a group setting -- nuance could get lost in the noise, and listeners could take offense where none was intended. Focus on journaling or other solitary creative work for now, instead of trying to share your inspiration with the masses. You can show people the results on another day when you feel equipped to explain yourself more clearly.","Your heart may be drawn toward spending more time with whoever you consider your family, but professional obligations could get in the way of making that a higher priority in your life. While your decision might come down to what is workable financially, don’t let trying to keep up with the Joneses skew your idea of where you should spend your money and time. Your money will go further if you stay focused on what is truly important to you.","The people around you today may be fun, but interacting with them might not be entirely fulfilling for you, especially if you feel that they only love your shallow side. It’s true that some people aren’t in a place where they can meet your more serious intellectual needs, and you may need to accept their limitations in that regard. In the end, though, there’s nothing wrong with having a good, light-hearted time, so keep your expectations realistic and let yourself enjoy it!","A financial boost could come your way today, but anyone who hears about it might feel entitled to a piece of the pie. If you don’t see a valid reason to share your resources at this time, do your best to keep the news to yourself. You may be tempted to come up with an elaborate cover story in case anyone asks questions, but you’re better off just being vague in your answers. People probably won’t ask if you don’t bring it up.","This is a day to enjoy yourself! However, if you were hoping to have a good time today with someone close, they might not feel like being social. While such a rejection could be disappointing, it’s wise to remember that one person cannot meet all of your needs. Other friends you haven't heard from in a while might welcome the opportunity to engage with you, so check in with them and ask what they have been up to lately.","If your life has become nothing but duties and responsibilities lately, you might find yourself attracted to some secret pleasure as an outlet for the pressure. The secrecy could be the biggest part of the excitement for you, as you might think it allows you to maintain your disciplined and industrious image. However, you probably aren’t able to hide your secret as well as you imagine. The good news is that most people won’t hold a little fun against you!","You may have been looking forward to a group chat with friends, only to discover they have all become obsessed with a new and trendy book or series -- and, for whatever reason, you just don’t connect with it. Even if you’re not interested in starting a debate about it, you might feel left out. Sometimes friends have different interests, of course, and you’re sure to find something to talk about if you have patience and let the conversation develop. You can find a way in!","A recent professional achievement could lose its luster for you if someone in your home or family makes it known that they feel threatened by your progress. As long as you meet your legitimate responsibilities to your loved ones, you did not do anything wrong, but change can be hard. The person who is upset may be afraid that you’ll have less time for them now. Even if that is true, try to emphasize that your new status will help you contribute in other ways.","Trying to communicate with someone close to you about domestic matters and everyday activities could be frustrating for you today, as somehow the most basic things seem confusing or unclear. You may find it more rewarding to fantasize together about your larger aspirations, like going on a trip or learning something new. The problems that may have been irritating you probably don't need to be resolved immediately, and zooming out to the big picture can help you realize that.","Someone else’s generosity could challenge your more practical attitude toward money today. Observers might wonder what you’re complaining about, as the situation likely appears to be in your favor. On the other hand, you could find your pride getting in the way of accepting a reward if you feel you didn’t earn it with your own effort. This may present a good opportunity for you to assess your attitude toward work. Know that you can be a hard worker without being hard on yourself.","Someone in a close friendship or relationship can remind you how to have fun, especially if you’ve forgotten to enjoy life lately. Once you get rolling, though, you might need to be careful with money -- you may feel like you totally deserve to overindulge thanks to showing restraint earlier. Some spending probably won’t be the end of the world, but try to keep your focus on your connection with the person you are with. When you feel loved, you may not be interested in overcompensating with money.","While efforts to beautify your home may be very successful, your own feelings about the project could be more complicated. It’s possible that this work is reminding you that others you live with don't seem to be pulling their weight around the house. Even if communicating with them feels difficult, you might be making it harder on yourself by dropping hints instead of using your words. Make sure what you want from them is clear -- to yourself as well as the others involved!"

The crafty Moon in Gemini can help us see a way around our problems, but trickster Mercury's provocative square to deceptive Neptune tempts us to spin reality into what we think others want to hear. Illusions may seem ideal, but honesty will take us further.","Connecting with others could help with any current feelings of sadness. If you feel overwhelmed by the prospect of talking directly about your emotions, it may be easier to let yourself relax and have some fun with someone you enjoy. Taking a light-hearted approach isn't about suppressing your feelings, it's about addressing problems in a more comforting manner. An artistic or physical outlet could be especially useful, as creative power could counteract any sense of powerlessness your troubles provoke.","Old family secrets could weigh on you today, but you may realize your current home life is helping to heal over scars from the past. Be careful how you talk to your peers about the situation, though, as they might interpret it through the lens of their own values rather than understanding what actually works for you. For now, you might be better off processing your family drama only with people who are already involved in it and understand its unique dynamics.","There could be drama in your friend group right now, and you may have the healing words needed to calm everyone down. However, this could trigger memories of a past situation where you might have felt responsible for moderating the moods of a parent or other authority figure. It could be easier for you to feel angry about the current conflict than to admit you were hurt earlier in your life, but try to be aware of where your reactions are coming from. These are two separate situations.","A financial boost could feel great today, especially if you see it as representing more than just money. You might interpret it as validation that you really did pursue the right path in life, even though you may have had significant naysayers early on. Be careful of how creative you get with your interpretation, though, as you also have the potential to idealize some philosophy in a way that could get out of hand! You might be better off just enjoying your bonus in the real world.","You could be feeling quite attractive and popular today, but don’t give away your power in the heat of the moment just to get additional food for your ego. It’s possible that someone is flattering you to try and make you agree to something that won’t be in your best interest. Keep hold of your intellect, and look very carefully at any offer involving the sharing of money or other resources. If the details are vague, any ambiguity is unlikely to be handled in your favor.","Someone who owes you could pay you back today, but they might not want a lot of attention drawn to the situation. They may even be vague about their reasons for keeping things under wraps. Though you might find all the secrecy intriguing, try to avoid constructing fantasies about this person or getting caught up in their drama. Just appreciate whatever settling of accounts you receive, and savor it in private if there is no necessary reason to involve others.","Old wounds from past relationships can be healed with a little help from your friends. You might have felt unworthy of attention from ex-lovers and other close partners, as though you needed to work in order to earn your place in their hearts. Thankfully, when you accept yourself as you are right now, you build the self-respect you need to gravitate toward people who accept the real you. If you are in a good place now, it's time to realize just how far you’ve come!","Your professional achievements may be admired today, which could help you resolve any feelings of inadequacy you have regarding your work. If you feel ashamed about the current status of your job, for example, you might become aware of the big difference your work makes in the lives of others. While it’s good to take pride in your work, don’t let this ego boost lure you into a deceptive financial arrangement. You can enjoy the fruits of your labor without taking additional risks.","A sense of home might be hard for you to find at the moment. Maybe you wouldn’t be terribly bothered by this rootlessness on your own, but someone close to you could be pushing you to commit to something more secure. Start your search by looking at what has historically been reliable in your life. You might discover that the one constant that has stuck with you throughout everything is your own commitment to adventure. Keep this in mind when you’re ready to build your new foundation.","Allowing your family to invest in you can help heal wounds from the past. People who once hurt you may not feel capable of apologizing out loud, so instead they might try to show through their actions that they have changed. It could get to the point that even you think they are overcompensating too dramatically. They may be relieved if you initiate a direct conversation, but only do this if you have the stamina to help them process their intense emotions.","You could have a healing conversation in a close relationship today, although you and the other person might still have problems with clearly understanding issues about money or material goods. While that might even be what provokes the big talk in the first place, it may become obvious that the underlying problem is really about deeper, unmet needs between the two of you. With your underlying foundation strengthened, you can work out the finer details another day.","When you work hard and fulfill your responsibilities, you can feel good about living in harmony with your values. Your practical side could surprise you right now; you might typically be known for seeing there is more to life than to-do lists and productivity, but getting stuff done on Earth could be more satisfying today than you’d previously thought. Concrete accomplishments can also give you some stability that may otherwise be hard to find within your fluid identity."
2021-07-08,"We want to know the truth, but not really. As inquisitive Mercury awkwardly nudges withholding Pluto, we might start digging into something, and then wish we hadn’t. We may be in a mood to idealize security as the sensitive Moon forms a harmonious trine with optimistic Jupiter. However, Venus makes a provocative square with impulsive Uranus at 3:25 pm EDT, reveling in the potential for surprise. Our illusions might be shattered, but liberation could be the eventual result after the dust settles.","You may reflect on your family background in an idealized way today. Still, a financial issue could motivate you to look deeper, and once you start searching for details, you might find it is hard to get a consistent story from or about your parents or other older relatives. You might be battling against someone else’s pride, especially if they feel ashamed of something regarding money or romance, but they may be more forthcoming if you can demonstrate you are not judging them.","Money should come down to just the facts and figures, however, expectations that you hold about how things should go for you financially might be making it more complicated than that. Furthermore, your friends may be encouraging you to take an overly optimistic view of what you can afford. A surprise at home, however, could force you to confront your financial reality now. Even if you are concerned about others being disappointed with you in the moment, the truth will ultimately set you free.","A boss, parent, or other authority figure may be very good to you financially right now, however, you might need to look at whether their benevolence comes with strings attached. A surprising interaction or revelation may lead you to see just how much this arrangement constrains your ability to express yourself. Even if you decide that the benefits are worth the costs of maintaining the status quo, you will be more empowered if you are aware that you are making this choice.","Although you may be feeling confident that you are a living example of your highest ideals, dealing with the odd frustrations that seem to come out of nowhere in a close relationship today could prove otherwise. Friends of yours who are not involved in the situation might see it clearly enough to call you out on your contradictions. As much as this may be upsetting in the moment, if you take in what they are saying, it could help you get in touch with your deeper values.","You may be more visible than usual in your work or public life today, leading you to reconsider which parts are really working for you. You could be questioning messages you have received from society about your work habits -- maybe you've been told something that your present circumstances prove to be inaccurate. You could also benefit now from looking at financial matters you take for granted, like taxes or your retirement plan, to see if they are set up in the most advantageous way possible for you.","Achieving your personal goals might not be as straightforward as you'd like. As clear as your stated ambitions may be, you could sabotage yourself if you feel like they don’t give you enough room for self-expression. If it is hard to identify exactly what you need to express, you might try intentionally telling one of your secrets to give yourself some breathing room. Idealizing one of your close relationships in public may also be a way for you to get positive attention today.","You like the world to make sense, but the dynamics of your family may be pushing you to a primal level not found in your preferred realm of rationality. Focusing on your work to get ahead professionally might seem like a more secure path. What could really comfort you, however, is the news. Seeing upheaval in the larger world may actually give you validation that you are not the only one dealing with turmoil, and that can at least make you feel less alone.","A close relationship of yours may help you professionally in an unexpected way. The new opportunity that comes from this could give you freedom to explore and express yourself. In the excitement of the moment, however, be sure to pin down the financial and logistical details of whatever is being proposed before you commit to anything. Though this conversation might not be fun to have, any misunderstanding resulting from a lack of clarity at this point has the potential to damage your relationship later.","A conversation may be necessary in a significant relationship, but you might be reluctant to put all your resources out on the table. Maybe there are things you do not want to share in this context because you feel that they belong to your family. Whatever you decide to do with the resources you have this ambivalence about, this relationship probably does need some fresh ideas for sharing the responsibilities of everyday life, so focus your energy on making a plan for that.","Taking a risk and opening up could get you some financial help. You are especially capable of telling others what is going on with you now, and someone listening might be moved to contribute more easily than you would expect. The hardest part could be that accepting their generosity challenges your view of yourself as someone who is self-reliant. They are probably giving to you because they value the relationship you have built with them over time, though, so you can take pride in that.","A sense of security could come from your money today and the hard work you put in to earn it. You may want to lean on the successful, predictable quality of this exchange, especially if your efforts to loosen up and express yourself only seem to bring frustration and disappointment lately. Thankfully, a close relationship might be able to jolt you out of this rut and reinvigorate your potential to enjoy life. You cannot do everything yourself, so let a loved one help you in this way.","The good news is your responsibilities might be lighter than usual today. What could interfere with your relaxation, however, is feeling guilty about others' expectations if you think you should be working harder. Realize that you don’t know the whole story of why anyone else is busier than you are now -- and that you don’t know how things will go for you in the future, either. You don’t need to dramatically brag to people about your easy day, just focus on your own present moment and enjoy it."
2021-07-09,"What we nurture, we get more of. Today the Moon’s friendly sextile to innovative Uranus waters whatever seeds we have planted and helps our creative efforts grow. The Moon’s challenging square to sensitive Chiron, however, may show whatever we have neglected to give proper nourishment. When the New Moon in Cancer takes place at 9:17 pm EDT, we can refresh our approach to taking care of ourselves, as well as the people and things we care about, by incorporating these findings going forward.","Home may be a cozy place for you now, but you might also feel like the cocoon of domestic life holds you back from expressing yourself in some ways. While almost any commitment puts some limits on your freedom, the financial or logistical stability that comes from your residence can give you the support you need to do your own thing. Putting some extra attention into your living space now will help it to nurture you in return.","You may be looking for a big conversation today, but you could take it hard if the other person tells you something you don’t want to hear. If this happens, ask yourself what you expected them to tell you. Maybe you were looking for the offensive words to come out of their mouth, but aren't so prepared to admit them to yourself. Harsh statements that are obviously false are easier to take than those that are a little bit true. Either way, self-awareness is ultimately a good thing.","Trying to keep up with the Joneses may be stressful for you, as you might feel like you do not measure up when you look at how your peers seem to be doing financially. Of course, you can't ever know the whole story about anyone else, but you can shift your focus to your own story and use what resources you have to support your secret dreams. Investing in yourself will feel empowering, and the benefits could grow with time.","You could feel especially in tune with your body today, and this is a great opportunity for you to alter or add to your appearance. If there is a change like a unique haircut or tattoo you have always wanted, but a parent or other authority figure stopped you from getting it in the past, you might see if you are still interested. Your own judgment is the most important at this point, but as a nice bonus, your peers will probably admire whatever you choose.","Rest and relaxation can greatly rejuvenate you today. Even if you do not believe you deserve a day of quiet, reflecting alone could be just what you need to get clarity on your professional goals. You might try turning to a book or mentor for guidance, yet it can be a letdown to admit that such sources do not always have the answers. Answers are within you, so allow yourself the time and space to receive them.","Your current sense of adventure may attract friends and acquaintances to join your explorations. The tradeoff is that you might not get to do everything your own way when others are involved. Although this can be frustrating, try to pick your battles. Be open to negotiation on the topics that are not really a big deal, but don't compromise on something that is truly important to you, or else you could spend the day feeling resentful instead of joyful.","Professional relationships may come into focus for you. Libras are known for their social nature, and you really do care about people. However, it could become obvious to you now that you put a lot of one-sided effort into nurturing people who are indifferent to you. You might discover that you have become the ""parent"" in your workplace who single-handedly takes care of everyone. Instead, what you need is a partner or team of partners who will support you like you support them.","Adventure may be calling you today. Whether it is a physical or intellectual journey you are drawn to, though, you might feel that your responsibilities are holding you back from diving in as deeply as you would like. Sharing your desires and frustrations with someone close can be a great opportunity to strengthen your relationship and to brainstorm options. Your collaborator could have ideas on how to make the logistics work, so do not give up no matter how full your calendar seems.","A conversation may be necessary in a significant relationship, but you might be reluctant to put all your resources out on the table. Maybe there are things you do not want to share in this context because you feel that they belong to your family. Whatever you decide to do with the resources you have this ambivalence about, this relationship probably does need some fresh ideas for sharing the responsibilities of everyday life, so focus your energy on making a plan for that.","Feelings of exhaustion and resentment may be setting in on both sides of a significant relationship in your life, especially if your connection has gotten too weighed down by the responsibilities of maintaining a household together. You might need to plan something fun with this person to renew your emotional bond. The tedium of duty tends to erase the individuality of everyone involved, so make an effort to focus on what makes each of you uniquely excited.","You have an opportunity to get your routine in order today in a way that really makes your home life hum. However, making it happen may require some hard conversations with the people you live with. If they are able to clearly see how the changes you propose will also benefit them, they might be more likely to go along with the plan. Still, you do need to maintain a sense of where your control begins and ends.","Spending may be tempting today, but you might keep more of your money if you get in touch with what really makes you happy. Though you may be concerned that focusing on your happiness is selfish, you are less likely to get distracted by things that look interesting in the moment but are not really what you want when you are attuned to your own desires. If you have trouble discerning this on your own, a good conversation with someone else could help."
2021-07-10,"Today has a dreamy, inward focus as the sensitive Moon in Cancer connects with nebulous Neptune and deep Pluto. Even if we feel we are lacking freedom in some ways, we can still find parts of our present situation to idealize. At 11:14 pm EDT, however, we may feel a frustratingly small second wind as the Moon, now in Leo, makes an awkward quincunx with Jupiter. Asserting ourselves might be tempting, but we don’t entirely have the energy.","Family harmony may feel like an achievable dream for you -- even if you’re aware that the dynamic favors some people over others. However idealistic your visions may be, you know that peace takes work in the real world. While there may be a part of you that wonders where your place is within these dynamics, this isn't the best time to speak up about it. Asserting yourself now could disrupt the calm sense of togetherness that is possible.","The people in your social network may inspire you now, as you feel like they are seriously engaged in making the world a better place. Their coherent philosophy for doing so can inspire you to start talking about the big stuff yourself. Any altruistic ideal worth holding, however, has to be able to accommodate many different individuals in all their complex habits. Bringing those insights into your everyday life at home will test them and show you if they are valid.","You may be exceptionally idealistic in your professional ambitions lately. While you could be more successful than you expect in securing financial support today, avoid emotionally manipulating people in a way that could lead to them feeling resentful later. Your best bet is developing an elevator pitch -- ask yourself how you would explain your proposal to a stranger in a few minutes, such as the duration of a short elevator ride. If you cannot do so clearly, you may need to work that out first.","You may have the idea that, if only you read more or traveled farther, your whole life would be different. While there are many benefits to going on a physical or intellectual journey, there are limits to what it can accomplish for you. It’s okay to explore to the extent that your budget can support, but you still should learn how to deal with difficult parts of life, like asserting yourself in your relationships. Wherever you go, you’re still you -- for better or worse!","Understanding of deep issues could come to you today, especially if you listen to the wisdom of your body. Though this may be an exciting development, it might be too vague to communicate to others at this point. For example, even if you sense a link between two things going on in your life, pinning down exactly what that link is might not be possible yet. Let your hunch simmer in peace for now so that, over time, it can grow into something more coherent.","Relationships of all kinds can be fascinating for you, but right now you might also find yourself tired. Even if the other people involved aren’t excessively overbearing, a tendency to lose yourself in these connections could be sapping your energy. While speaking up for yourself might seem like it requires effort, holding back ultimately does too. It can be hard to get time to rest when you need to, but taking a pause will help you figure out how to adjust your approach.","Boundaries at work and home could be a challenge for you at the moment, as you feel inundated with demands you cannot seem to escape. If your friends pile on by telling you there’s something wrong with how you approach these burdens, you might be tempted to snap at them -- after all, no one likes an armchair quarterback. Instead, try quietly watching how they handle similar situations in their own lives. Simply seeing other ways of doing things may be quite informative for you.","You may identify strongly with your political or religious views today, to the point of aggressively defending them to others. Your professional life, however, might not resonate as deeply with you. Your frustration in this realm could be pushing you toward extremism in the areas where you do feel more certain. Regardless of your ideological opinions, you will probably be happier overall if you try to make the rest of your life fit you as well as those views do.","A money issue may be hard to sort out at home, and the problem might not be the most obvious suspect. If calculations began with an unrealistic view of what things would cost, for example, you would come up short even if everyone contributed the amount that was agreed upon. Instead of turning on each other, you and whoever else is involved need to revisit the big picture together. Once you can identify the problem, you can find the best solution.","Communication in a close relationship could be beautiful today. Though you may have ongoing challenges with this person that will need to be addressed at some point, flowing with the idealistic vibe of the moment can replenish a reservoir of good feelings in your relationship. You will probably need that positive foundation to help you deal with the tough stuff between the two of you at a later time. For now, remember everything you admire about this friend or loved one, and let them know it.","Practical work might feel ideal today, as it seems more doable than resolving any heavier issues that are weighing on you. Performing these physical or routine tasks can help to instill peace of mind, which can eventually lead to some deeper introspection. The other people around you have their own needs and values that may differ from yours, however, and they might have plans other than joining in on your to-do list. Follow your bliss, but honor the boundaries of others.","A community you are part of may have an especially intense energy at the moment. You might be inclined to just go with the flow of the group, because it feels easier than asserting yourself. When your practical responsibilities call, however, you’ll need to break off and take care of them on your own without your posse. Pay attention to your emotions and sensations as you deal with any tedious duties. You may be pleasantly surprised by what you discover about yourself in the process!"
2021-07-11,"Our feelings start to find their way into our speech today as communicator Mercury enters sensitive Cancer at 4:35 pm EDT. This offers us great emotional power that we could use to help or harm ourselves and others around us. As the Moon in dramatic Leo tangles with stern Saturn and rebellious Uranus this evening, however, our first impulse might be to react wildly to any provocation. Solving our real problems could be hard when minor issues are far easier to find.","You may feel like your community is pushing back on you or suppressing you, but this provocation only gives you renewed clarity about why you value what you value. You might feel especially emotional about your background or your family, so lashing out could be tempting if you feel like someone is disrespecting that. On the other hand, defending your family’s honor in public might be easier than directly talking to them about how deep your feelings are. Stretch your comfort zone today and do what scares you.","An authority figure may push you that much too far today, convincing you to finally talk back to them. You have the emotional power to state your case, and this can get the people around you to take your side -- at least in the moment. However, if these allies conveniently vanish when you have to deal with the consequences, you could feel even more alone than before. Such an incident could at least show you the holes that need filling in your support system.","Financial matters may be on your mind more than usual right now. This might push you to be very precise when communicating with others, as you can see how speaking in an unclear way could literally cost you something. If you are being vague because you fear that someone is judging you or threatening to punish you, you might feel resentful at first. When you consider how embracing the specific details can actually help you achieve your goals, however, you could make surprising progress.","Money may feel tight for you, and this pressure could motivate you to reach out to your social network in search of new earning opportunities. With communicator Mercury entering your sign today, you’ll get a boost in your capacity to explain yourself to others, making this a good time to update your social media presence. People who already have some familiarity with you might get a clearer sense of how your skills intersect with their needs, and connections can grow from there.","Making your mark on the world could be easier than getting validation in your close relationships today, and this might not be the first time in your life that you have had such an experience. Mercury can now help you articulate your hidden motivations better than usual, so reflect on your attitude toward achievement and what you hope to get out of it. Whether or not you wind up in the spotlight, you will have a greater positive impact by coming from a healthy place.","Conflict may arise between taking care of your responsibilities and pursuing adventure today. The deciding factor might be your own energy level, and it could be calling you to rest! Both the responsibilities and the adventure will still be there tomorrow if you step back for now. Meanwhile, your friends might have a lot to say, so you could reach out to someone you haven’t heard from in a while if you absolutely must check something off your to-do list.","Your social network might bring you a new professional opportunity -- whether or not you were looking for one. Since unfortunately not all friendships can survive the jump to working together, use your keen eye for interpersonal dynamics to assess how changing boundaries would change the relationship before you accept the offer. The workplace might demand a more serious side of you than your friend is used to seeing, which could be jarring for them. This opportunity may, however, be just the transformative experience you need.","Domestic demands may feel like heavy weights dragging down your ambitions. With intellectual Mercury now boosting your capacity for philosophy, you’re probably able to work that into quite the overarching narrative about how the whole world is against you. However, it’s possible that your current challenge is ultimately a sign that you can’t do everything all by yourself. Reaching out to another person for help could solve this struggle, allowing you to write a happy ending to your story.","Taking care of your responsibilities may get you out and about more than usual today -- which is probably a welcome adventure. At the same time, you may be focused on complex financial matters like taxes, retirement planning, and insurance, so you might check whether you need to consult with a professional about any of that. If you see these matters as intimidating, realize they are actually learning opportunities. Putting your affairs in order now can give you the freedom to enjoy greater exploration later.","Fiscal restraint may be easier to stick to if you have a sense of your specific financial goals. Right now you could be on the verge of figuring out how to use your funds in a way that truly nourishes your needs for pleasure and personal growth, rather than pilfering it away. Consider talking this over with someone you trust for guidance. Taking care of yourself like this can help you reach your goals and make your commitments sustainable.","The way out of a relationship conflict in your home could be reconfiguring responsibilities so they are spread more equitably. When you finally see the right configuration, you may wonder how it did not occur to you sooner. However practical you may usually be, your way of thinking about this mundane realm can be surprisingly emotional now; your attitude toward fairness may consider past grievances that still sit with you today. Stay focused on the matter at hand, and you could actually get things to work.","Taking care of your responsibilities might be frustrating today -- if you can, it’s okay to give in to the temptation to talk rather than work. Mercury is encouraging you to think about how to express yourself and have fun, and the people around you might have some good ideas as well! Wit and creativity have a frivolous reputation, but they can ultimately help you address more serious challenges in their own way. A good laugh might even motivate you to get back to work."
2021-07-12,"Our emotional security, our sense of pleasure, and our self-assertion are all on the same page as the sensitive Moon unites with Venus and Mars in individualistic Leo. The combined willful force is enough to shake off the weight of collective expectations, though the Moon nods to distant Pluto and Neptune just enough to still acknowledge them. Later, when communicator Mercury makes a harmonious trine with gentle Jupiter at 3:45 pm EDT, we’ll be better able to explain our choices in a way that makes sense.","Life may have become too serious for you lately. If you’re stressed out, trying to take a quiet rest could actually make you feel worse, as it would give you time to ruminate about all your burdens in even more detail. Like how children usually nap better after running around, you might see if your inner child can burn off excess energy with some raucous play. Even if you aren’t in a position to work up a sweat, just a good laugh could help!","Advice on how to run your family life may be coming your way, whether you want it or not! You might come across this advice in a book you've sought out yourself, or perhaps a friend just goes off unsolicited, but whatever you are hearing may not resonate with you. If the backseat drivers seem to be missing some crucial piece of the unique dynamics of your family, you don’t have to do what they say. Your family members are individuals, and your best bet for unsnarling things with them is probably talking to them directly.","An idealized authority figure whom everyone seems to adore might be on your mind today, and not in a good way. You may be disappointed because you feel like this person insulted something you value deeply, but worry that doing anything other than revering them is asking for controversy. You might be able to state your case more articulately than usual, but try to focus on what you stand for and what you propose to do about it rather than on how other people are wrong.","Lofty intellectual or spiritual ideals of what a relationship should be like may be deflating one of your close connections. You are human, and it’s okay to want some material security or pleasure in this situation, even if you feel guilty because you think that seems shallow. Your current capacity for philosophical thinking can also be used to advocate on your own behalf. Try evaluating whether your view of the world is meeting your needs and proceed accordingly.","The pressure to share credit with others for your work may have become too much. While you are able to see the value of taking a background role when appropriate, things have probably gotten out of balance, and you know it. Even if you don’t have a problem with the way tasks are distributed, you deserve to be recognized for the contributions you have been making. Talking privately to someone else involved would be a good first step toward solving the problem.","Social activities can be rewarding, but commitments that interest or excite you in the moment may be distracting you from your deeper needs. You might need some serious alone time right now to figure out who you are and what you want. Even if you feel guilty about stepping back from others, if you don’t get the rest you need, you could become irritable and take it out on your companions. The connections that are worth keeping will still be there when you return.","Routines at work and home can keep your life stable; you might even be able to reach from this solid foundation to further your bigger career ambitions. However, your biggest source of pleasure now could be your broader social world. The people you don’t have domestic or professional obligations to can be the most fun people in your life because you’re able to just enjoy them in the moment. To refresh your perspective, embrace the creative vibe of these communities.","Your hard-won understanding of who you are and what you enjoy still may not add up to an easy answer for what you should do with your life. Complicating matters further, you might get recognition now for something that is not your true passion. An achievable first step toward resolving this dilemma would be giving yourself permission to pursue whatever recognition you can get without feeling like that makes you shallow. Whether or not it leads to anything bigger, you could use a win for now.","You may have been really trying to embrace fiscal restraint and your domestic responsibilities lately, even though those are not your passions. Is your need for adventure burning a hole in you? There could be more room in the household budget than you think for some kind of exploration, whether physical or intellectual. Ask around and see what the people in your home or family think about a group activity. You might not be the only one in the grip of wanderlust.","Although you are able to work through complex issues in your own head, the type of important breakthrough you really need right now might not come to you alone. You may be more capable than usual of explaining your perspective to another person, making it less likely you will be misunderstood. Take the risk of letting them in -- after all, they could have a stake in the outcome too. When you join forces, the two of you can get to the bottom of things.","A new person in your life could be fascinating to you today -- or maybe you’ll find a fresh burst of energy in a relationship you have had for a long time, whether the context is friendship, business, or anything else. Discipline and practical matters may have been important to you lately, but the pull you feel to this new connection shows that you cannot keep your nose to the grindstone permanently. You need this infusion of passion and creativity, so let yourself enjoy it.","Figuring out the balance between your social life and your individual identity could be frustrating for you. There are multiple paths in front of you to choose from, and perhaps none are objectively wrong, yet all the options make it more difficult to discover which is right for you personally. Focusing on the practical side of life may be an easier place to begin today. You can clearly tell when the tasks from your to-do list get done, and you can do them with flair."
2021-07-13,"What we want and how we go about getting it are in sync as desire-focused Venus and assertive Mars make a powerful conjunction at 9:33 am EDT. Meanwhile, the Moon in detail-oriented Virgo forms a harmonious sextile with communicator Mercury, so we can convince others that joining our schemes makes logical sense. The Moon’s opposition to overbearing Jupiter, however, may introduce odd power dynamics where one person wants to be seen as nurturing others. We must be careful to respect everyone’s independence.","Taking care of routine responsibilities around the house could have a higher spiritual meaning for you today. You might be aware of the subtle energy of your space, as in Feng Shui, even if that’s not something you’re familiar with. No matter what, just try to keep your process of tidying as fun as you can. Applying creativity to your task can help you shape your residence into a true reflection of your personality, giving you a foundation from which to shine.","Friends could be generous to you now, and you may feel understood when you talk with them. You might not think to classify your conversations as a nurturing experience, as they aren’t necessarily dripping with sweet sentimentality. However, if a more active and fun style of connection leaves you feeling taken care of, then ""nurturing"" might be a fair term for what happened. Seeing this can help you refine your own approach to meeting the needs of others when it’s your turn to do so.","People in positions of power can seem impenetrable, but sometimes they demand more nurturing than anyone else. You might wind up participating in that kind of dynamic today. Even if it’s awkward for you to have your boss or parent treating you like you’re responsible for them, you could be financially rewarded for your labor. Perhaps what they want from you is not as unreasonable as it seems; before complaining about it, ask yourself if you’re the one expecting to be taken care of.","Money and other resources could seem to be magnetically drawn to you at this time. It helps that you can state your case well if necessary, especially since your way of finding things may be more creative than usual. You might also be able to maintain a good balance between the details and the whole situation, ensuring you don’t miss the forest for the trees. This makes whatever you’re proposing sound plausible, so it’s a good time to pitch your ideas to others.","Charm can soften almost any aggressive approach, and you currently have the personal magnetism to try to pull that off. To get the maximum positive effect from this power, you may have to turn some of it inward and examine your own hidden blocks or sensitivities, particularly regarding money. With this knowledge, you’ll probably be able to approach a potential benefactor with more confidence than usual. This could go well for you -- not in an exploitative way, but in a way that leads to a mutually satisfying collaboration.","Your radar for subtle things is active at the moment, and you can use it to find treasures that are hiding in plain sight. One place to look is your extended social network -- a friend or acquaintance you don’t know well or haven’t spoken to in a while could turn out to be someone you’d like to cultivate a closer relationship with. Look for clues that this person cares for you as an individual, because you may need more of that positivity in your life.","You could find yourself moving ahead in your career at this time, and luck might not be the only thing propelling you forward. Your sensitivity toward subtlety and attention to detail could be helping you excel at the routine tasks of your job. Though you may be worried that getting promoted or recognized would provoke others to be jealous of you, your peers might admire your competence and take it better than you think. Tastefully enjoying your accomplishments is well within your rights.","Today you can communicate with others in a way that both acknowledges the big picture and expresses your personal creativity. Even if you’re only thinking about having fun in that moment, you never know who is listening and noticing your skills -- a professional opportunity could emerge from such a casual encounter. You may not be able to anticipate the details, but you can prepare by generally thinking about how you want to feel in your next job.","You could be on the receiving end of an inheritance of some kind, even if you're not expecting any money or heirlooms to be passed down. A challenging background, for example, could provide you with gifts like resilience and strength. Whatever your foundation might be, you can rely on it at this point to push you forward. Your search for meaning is also on fire now, so take this opportunity to turn your origin story into an empowering narrative and let it fuel you.","Communicating in a close relationship could go well for you now, because you’re more able to see the big picture. You may be able to use this skill to resolve a matter of shared money or property that has become confused. Just make sure that the strategy you’re using to get what you want isn’t blocking your way toward your desired results. Working with the other person involved can help you both find a solution that is creative and focused on your shared goals.","A new person in your life could be fascinating to you today -- or maybe you’ll find a fresh burst of energy in a relationship you have had for a long time, whether the context is friendship, business, or anything else. Discipline and practical matters may have been important to you lately, but the pull you feel to this new connection shows that you cannot keep your nose to the grindstone permanently. You need this infusion of passion and creativity, so let yourself enjoy it.","You may be feeling very good about yourself today, inspiring you to spread this positivity toward other people in your life. Of course, the things that make others feel good are not necessarily the same things that you find fulfilling. As you might discover today, truly loving another person requires recognizing their unique, individual needs. You could have a particular gift for giving physical pleasures right now like food or a massage, so use your sensitivity to determine what will be most welcome."
2021-07-14,"The security-focused elements of Earth and Water are emphasized today, but the way they interact with each other still supports creativity and idealism. The Moon in detail-oriented Virgo forms a harmonious sextile with the Sun in sensitive Cancer at 9:46 pm EDT, so we can identify the subtle things around us that need improvement. Though the Moon challenges elusive Neptune, which could make perfection the enemy of the good, the Moon’s friendly trine to Uranus encourages us to try new things anyway.","Making progress on your to-do list can feel quite rewarding today when you actually see the results. Whether your focus is getting your finances in order or making your home look better -- or some of both -- your accomplishments are concrete. Where you have more room for interpretation is deciding what all this means. You might go in the direction of understanding these accomplishments as allowing more room for energy to flow, in your home and in yourself. If not, you can just enjoy the tidiness!","You might idealize a community you’re involved in, thinking that it is the source of everything good in your life. Keep in mind that people stick together when they are mutually compatible, so something within you must have drawn you to them. As you get better at communicating what you think right now, you may start shaking up your public image. Embrace the circumstances and groups that bring out the best in you, but don’t minimize what you contribute to the equation.","Money matters might run smoothly enough for you at the moment, but situations from early in life may be influencing your view of such things. Even if your boss or another authority figure treats you well overall, you could be thinking of them like a parent, who would be obligated to provide you security on a much greater level. While some amount of this transference may be unavoidable, try to be aware of your motivations so that you can handle any unexpected situations appropriately.","The finer points of your view of the world could be relevant today, but your emotions are so powerful that it may be hard for you to focus on such details. If someone really pushes you to pin things down, there might be strength in admitting that you don’t know that particular answer. Emphasize instead what you do get from your philosophy. Even if the biggest attraction of your worldview is that it simply provides you an identity and community, there is power in honesty.","Professional changes could make you more money, even if they aren’t public at this point. If you feel yourself beginning to idealize a collaboration of resources you are considering, though, be careful. Magic is possible, but just as a successful magician needs to know how their tricks work, you need to keep track of the details of your plans. Maintain enough contact with reality to make certain that everyone involved gets all of the information they need to make a good decision.","You may need to get in touch with your inner self while the Moon travels through your sign today. Though your close relationships, your intellectual explorations, and your larger social network can all help your development, they could also overwhelm you. Use your capacity for discernment to find out where you are in all of this. When you have a better grasp of your own identity, you’ll have more to give back to all of these commitments that are important to you.","Even if your public role is getting a boost at this point, some of the details could still be under construction. The situation may require you to be more comfortable with ambiguity than you prefer, at least for now. Try to discern the difference between questions that can be resolved given time and patience, and vagueness with no hope of clarity. The latter could later be used against you, so avoid combining resources if that is a factor.","A community that you’re part of may bond over shared passions and introduce you to exciting people you want to get to know better. It could be easy for you to get caught up in the crowd, and letting the hard edges of your own identity dissolve a little bit to make that happen could feel really good. You don't need to push against it -- as long as you’re aware of what you’re doing, a controlled release can be liberating.","An innovative approach to your routine tasks could lift your career at this time. Still, when considering a new professional opportunity, you may need to be mindful of how it will affect your current domestic responsibilities. You have the cleverness to find a solution to any challenges that arise, but you need to be aware of them in order to address them. That in mind, there isn’t anything wrong with pursuing your own advancement, and this potential change could ultimately result in a more functional home life.","Today you may be pushed to evaluate how well your philosophy of life is working out for you. One of the more obvious ways you can tell is by asking yourself whether it facilitates or gets in the way of healthy relationships and self-expression. Do your best to state your philosophy clearly in your own words. If you can’t, this might mean you are relying too much on other influences to lead you around. Think your own thoughts and let introspection guide you.","A proposal for sharing resources could catch your interest today. Your family or co-workers might be on board with the idea, but you may wonder whether they have thought it all the way through. If the details are vague as to what you will contribute or gain, it might not end well for you. Insist on clarity before you commit to anything, but be open to the possibility -- your critical feedback could improve the idea and make it more viable.","You may feel unsure of yourself and be tempted to look to one of your close relationships for security. While the other person might not be able to fulfill your deepest needs, they could show you a good time in the moment. The easy communication and fun that you experience in this connection could help you center yourself and come back down to Earth. You do have the capacity to self-soothe, but sometimes you may need a little help finding it."
2021-07-15,"What needs healing in our lives can become obvious today as wounded Chiron turns retrograde at 12:41 pm EDT. Meanwhile, the Moon in relationship-oriented Libra provokes Mercury in emotional Cancer, so it might be hard to distinguish between people’s words and our pre-existing personal issues, making it easy to get our feelings hurt. Luckily, when the Sun makes a harmonious trine with creative Neptune, we’ll also have an opportunity to understand the stories of our lives in more optimistic ways.","Home could be a contentious place today, as you may feel tempted to bicker with others there. A resurgence of old wounds could be making you sensitive about yourself, and the people around you now might not be responsible for that. If you aren’t able to get along with others peacefully, it’s okay to withdraw and be alone until you feel better. What you really need is a place to rest and recharge, and home can be wherever you find that.","You may belong to a group of people that shares your desire to improve the world. Even so, when it comes time to act on this, it could be hard to decide what should be your highest priority. You might be torn today between a communication-based task and more physical work. To break the tie and determine your greatest strength in the moment, it can help to reflect on what motivates you toward your goal. Either way, your heart is in the right place.","Idealism about how your career could save the world may cloud your ability to see how much money you’re really making. If you come up short financially, you might be tempted to gamble to close the gap. Stay strong and don’t let peer pressure push you into doing something reckless. Acknowledge the benefits and disadvantages of your own choices. If you can see you had your reasons, even though the results may not have been all you wanted, you can decide how to move forward.","Your early background may be on your mind, as you reflect on how it shaped you. A current problem with an authority figure in particular could be digging up memories of how you felt when you were a child being pushed around by others. Remember that you’re no longer in the past and that, this time, things can end differently. Empower yourself by framing the story of your life in a way that emphasizes how you have grown and learned to conquer your challenges.","Secrets may not be safe with you today, because you could wind up revealing information that was supposed to be hidden. It might be more that something slips out as a result of poor boundaries than that you intentionally plan the disclosure, but it would be embarrassing either way. As you question yourself about how this happened, you may discover that there are some assumptions hiding in your worldview that aren’t helpful. Take advantage of this opportunity to correct your course.","Impressing others may be a priority for you right now, as you value your relationships in your community. If you feel like you don’t have enough to offer by just being yourself, you may be tempted to spend impulsively to keep up with peer pressure. Reflecting on your past money mistakes could help you get some perspective. Carrying today’s emotional vibe with you as you review them might help you discover that self-worth issues played a role then, too. Transformation begins with identifying the problem.","Your career may be buzzing with potentially beneficial activity, however, the more emotional part of you might find all the chaos and hubbub stressful. Libras are keenly sensitive to relationship dynamics -- if people are changing places in your professional world, keeping track of which co-workers moved where could be weighing on you more than you realize. To minimize your load, try to stay focused on your own business for now. Everyone else will still be around when things settle down.","An old health problem you thought was resolved may return. Instead of assuming the worst, try to reflect on what might have triggered a relapse. If you can make intellectual sense of your body’s seemingly random symptoms, they could become less intimidating to you. The fear that you have no control over what is happening may be worse than the symptoms themselves. Fitting these occurrences into a predictable pattern can help you make plans to prevent or manage them in the future.","Unraveling family secrets may intrigue you today, and your way of looking into them might not be strictly logical. A boost of intuition could tell you where to dig deeper. Though you may be excited about what you are learning, telling your friends about your findings at this point can distract you. Their suggestions, however well-intentioned, could throw you off your scent. Your biggest need now is to develop confidence in your own inner voice, and you can refine the details later.","Relationships can be full of power struggles for you at this time. A lot may go without saying between you and the other person, and there is both good and bad to that. However, practicing good communication could reveal that the conflict is about who is considered the authority in a particular issue at hand. This may take you back to a familiar dynamic from your childhood that dredges up old feelings, so try to remain grounded in the present moment.","Idealizing the process of working to make money may not be going well for you. If your financial results aren’t what you expected, it might be time to examine your philosophical views on work. It could become apparent that you’re living out a story that someone else told you. Even if the facts you learned secondhand aren’t entirely wrong, you may need to learn how to articulate a narrative and make a plan that resonates more with your own personal experiences.","Schemes to get rich quick might tempt you today. Even if you already have enough money to meet your financial needs, you could definitely be motivated by your emotional needs for security and recognition. The prospect of cold, hard figures in your bank account might seem more solid and achievable than other things in your life, but at least try to deal with the other things before you pursue any really risky enterprises. You could make more progress than you expect."
2021-07-16,"We may like the idea of things today, and our plans might really be solid as the Moon in Libra forms a stabilizing trine with Saturn in Aquarius -- both intellectual Air signs -- at 6:33 am EDT. However, these plans could have a better outcome if we are able to be realistic about their limitations. The Moon’s interactions with individualistic Uranus and sensitive Chiron are more challenging, so we may not get everything we want in terms of sensual pleasure or understanding from others.","You could have the opportunity today to get to know people one-on-one within a community you are part of. The resulting relationships might not be the most emotionally expressive, but they are likely to be stable. Still, you could come to wonder if peace depends on you suppressing your individuality indefinitely. You may have a more physical, sensual side that is at odds with the side of yourself you display in this context, but the connection can be rewarding if your expectations are not unrealistic.","Responsibilities associated with your work may be overwhelming at the moment. While you might be proud of your ability to get everything done, you could also feel resentful that the burden is all on you. You may see some ways that the processes should be improved, but raising your concerns could upset the harmony of things going along as they are. The situation is not entirely harmonious if it weighs that heavily on you, though, so taking the risk might be worthwhile.","You are now capable of disciplined intellectual inquiry that also feels like a true expression of yourself, but you might not be ready to share your findings with your friends yet. That could be hard on you, because your sign likes things to be easy to communicate. Right now, time spent in solitude can release a side of you that is more placid than usual, where not everything has to be talked out. Though this may be at odds with your overall view of yourself, it has its place.","Obligations and financial ties may keep your family relationships stable in a way, but you might also feel some emotional wounds from a dynamic where familial authority has been used against you. Unfortunately, turning to friends to help you process this could be frustrating. They may not understand why you choose to stay in this situation, but they also might not know the whole story. Whether or not explaining in detail is worth the trouble for you, it's your own perspective that counts the most.","You may be able to communicate clearly with another person and succeed in getting your point across right now. From your perspective, the answer to something like a legal matter or question of religious dogma might seem to be straightforward. Be honest with yourself, however, about whether you are handling the situation with the compassion it deserves. The physical nature of humans is often more complex than many intellectual systems acknowledge, but everyone involved could have a better long-term outcome if you allow for that.","Though your responsibilities at work may be heavier than usual, you might be fine with this because you associate being needed and getting stuff done with financial security. Your intellectual explorations, however, could be nudging you to consider that security is not necessarily what you think it is. While you don’t have to make radical changes immediately, you may need to start the process of looking at whether your current sense of safety comes at the cost of compromising something truly important.","Even if you feel secure in your own identity today, being misunderstood by someone you expected more from could hurt. While working to engage with them on serious matters could eventually lead to a breakthrough, this would not be a quick or easy conversation even in a best-case scenario. You might have to decide what it is worth to have people truly get you right now. If you can accept that the limitations of others are not really about you, you might have more peace.","Though your relationships may have been exciting lately, you might find solitude more compelling at the moment. You could be tempted to hide behind work as an excuse for avoiding other people, but they may be less likely to feel left out if you admit to your more vulnerable feelings like being tired or overwhelmed. Home can be a stable and grounding place for you to rest now, so try to be honest that rest is what you need.","You may have to step up in your social group today, taking on a starring role as the voice of reason in a situation that has gotten heated. While you might be proud of your ability to calm things down, you could also feel a little resentful about being in this position. Maybe you secretly wish you could get away with being as emotional as whoever has the big feelings that you have to manage. Acknowledging that group dynamics are not always fair could bring some relief.","A professional change could be something you like in theory, but the reality of how it plays out in your life might be more complex. Though the attraction may be an increase in financial stability, you could also discover that you are not able to spend as much time with your family or pursuing your personal interests. You will probably be less resentful if you have a realistic idea of this tradeoff going in. If it’s your informed choice, you won't be surprised later.","Serious thought may be your jam today. You might enjoy seeing yourself as a brilliant philosopher, but the people around you might not be able to keep up with you, and that could be disappointing. Your disappointment may not only be based in the present moment, though -- you could also be reacting against messages you received in your upbringing urging you to be more practical. With your capacity to make fine intellectual distinctions, try to keep track of who is responsible for what.","You may be able to look into a hidden or mysterious matter in a calm and disciplined way today, and you can make orderly sense of whatever you find. When you see the facts laid out this clearly, though, you might realize you have discovered something that challenges your deeply held values. If you do not feel ready to talk to anyone else about this conflict right away, take the time you need to process it in private. Make the case to yourself first."
2021-07-17,"Power corrupts, but so does the lack of it. When the assertive Sun opposes passive-aggressive Pluto at 6:46 pm EDT, we may have to confront whoever we feel is holding us back, and the battle might not be as clean as we’d prefer. Meanwhile, the mediating Moon in Libra squares both the Sun and Pluto, forming an intense configuration known as a T-square. Even though a third path can lead out of a conflict between two parties, a good compromise rarely fully pleases either side.","A current close relationship could give you a new perspective on your family of origin. Power dynamics that you may have simply taken for granted could look more shocking to someone who is not used to seeing them play out, and they might say so. Take into consideration any feedback that you receive now, just remember that the source may have biases of their own. Be open to change, but beware of trading one set of troubles for another.","Some parts of your view of the world may be tested now, as you see that what actually works in your immediate surroundings is different from what your ideology would suggest. Admitting you were wrong is always hard, but you might feel less ashamed of yourself if you can acknowledge that your views were reasonable within the environment that existed at the time you came to hold them. When the world itself changes, it’s OK to allow yourself to adapt as well.","You may feel blocked from making progress toward your financial goals, and you might think that this is not really your own fault -- there could seem to be someone else in the way. Taking an impulsive risk to get ahead might be less scary than directly confronting the problematic person. While trying to increase your financial status separately from whatever is contested could help you, make sure your desire for revenge doesn’t cloud your common sense. Don’t wager anything you can’t afford to lose.","Someone you really need to tell off might feel impenetrable. If confronting them is too nerve-wracking, you may be tempted to take out your anger on the people you live with. You would be better off opening up to your home team about what is weighing on you -- ideally before you snap. They can at least provide emotional support and validation so you feel less alone. In a best-case scenario, they could even be able to help you solve the problem.","Work or other responsibilities may feel onerous today, and it might seem obvious to you that this is caused by some toxic dynamic that is more tiptoed around than openly addressed. You have the power to decide whether you want to continue tiptoeing or risk addressing the issue. Though you cannot guarantee the necessary conversation will be comfortable if you choose to initiate it, you already know that you’re uncomfortable with the way things are now. Things are unlikely to get better unless someone makes a stand.","You may find yourself in conflict with an organization you belong to at this time. Whether you’re pushing them to change or they’re pushing you to change, one way to cut through the confusion might be to look at which side is acting in accordance with the organization’s stated values. Whatever you find, this could also be a great opportunity for you to see whether you still hold those values yourself. If you have grown apart, acknowledging the reality about your differences may be the best policy.","Wherever you go, at home or work, you probably seem to be the mediator today. If peace between two warring parties depends on you, there might at least be room to request some concessions for your own interests. While you may take pride in being able to solve everyone else’s problems, what could benefit you the most in the long run is fixing a few things for yourself while you’re fixing everything for others. Being vulnerable like this can be hard but rewarding.","The beliefs that really motivate some of your views about the world may become apparent today. They might not be what you expected, and you could feel that the truth somehow makes you look petty or not as sophisticated as you’d prefer. Before you judge yourself too harshly, remember that if acting on your philosophy leads to positive results in the real world, then maybe you don’t need to feel bad about having come to the right answer for the wrong reasons. Focus on what works.","Someone could be trying to get you to invest in a financial opportunity, but you might be suspicious for reasons you can’t pin down. While getting all of the facts is certainly important, you may be reluctant to get involved even if a case can be made that doing so is in your best interest. Looking at how your peers have handled similar situations would be informative for you, even if you choose to follow a different path or only partially follow their example.","Power struggles can bubble to the surface in a close relationship today. Even if your behavior could be objectively described as controlling, the root of it might be a valid need that you think would not be met if you just asked the other person directly. An outside authority figure may be able to help you mediate this dispute. It might be hard to admit that you have needs, but being vulnerable in this way could help you get the relationship back on track.","You could be really focused on the correct way to do routine tasks today, but it may not be enough for you to do everything right yourself. If you realize that you’re coming down hard on others for petty things, you may need to look at what you hope to achieve by trying to control their technique. Evaluating your hidden agenda through the lens of your larger view on life can help you find a more productive way to meet your deeper needs.","Things might not be going your way in a community that you’re a part of, tempting you to remind them of money or other resources you have given them over time. This could at least get you resentful compliance for the moment. If you really aren’t on the same page with these people, however, you may be better off figuring out how to unsnarl your resources from theirs sooner rather than later. That way, you’ll have more freedom to follow your own path going forward."
2021-07-18,"Our emotional needs could be intense today as the Moon moves through the powerful Water sign of Scorpio. When it trines articulate Mercury at 9:13 am EDT, we might be able to put this depth into words. Both the Moon and Mercury, however, run into trouble with grumpy Saturn, and others may not seem to care how we feel. Meanwhile, distant Pluto and Neptune nudge passionate Venus and Mars, reminding us that we matter as individuals even when it is inconvenient.","You may have your finger on the emotional pulse of your loved ones today. What you detect might be that your familial relationships look a little different from how people picture the average family. There’s no need to worry that anyone else thinks you're strange -- after all, everyone’s family is at least a little different from the norm. Don’t invite judgment by asking others for their opinions. If you follow your heart, you’re unlikely to go wrong.","Conversation has a lot of productive potential for you at this time, especially one-on-one. You can listen to the other person so that they feel heard, and this in turn makes them more willing to consider your side of the story. Trying to act on your findings may be more frustrating, as they might not be what a relevant authority figure wants to hear. If this person won’t listen right away, focus on strengthening your own foundation so you can try again another day.","Money may flow easily to you as a result of your work at this time. The hard part might be that the job itself doesn’t live up to your ideal of what you should be doing with your life. Even if you appreciate your current level of financial security, you could feel like you deserve a career with more meaning or a higher social status. Talking out your concerns with someone else can help you get perspective. Whatever you conclude, being heard feels good!","Though you might be able to put into words what really brings you joy, actually making it happen could be another story. You could feel tied down by a situation where you share money or property with someone else, as whatever you have in mind might be seen as too risky for the collective purse. Your best bet might be to focus on building up your own resources; doing that will allow you more freedom to do what you want with your assets.","Rest may be calling you, but someone else is likely making a competing demand for your attention. If you feel like you just aren’t up for dealing with them, you might need to insist on focusing on yourself. You could lash out if you don’t get the downtime you need, which would ultimately cause more drama than disappointing the other person in the moment. When you honor your own needs, you’ll have more to give back to others whenever you’re ready.","Communicating with your friends and acquaintances can go smoothly for you today, in terms of spreading useful information and making people feel heard. If you have responsibilities hanging over your head, however, you might feel so guilty about socializing that you don’t fully enjoy it. Though you may think that this is the last thing you have time to do, turning inward to reflect on your priorities could be very helpful for you. It’s okay for joy to be one of those priorities.","Financial security could feel more attainable than ever as your career grows to new heights. On the other hand, you might realize by now that this success comes at the cost of your personal expression being curtailed in some way. Expecting to get all of your emotional needs met by your work is probably not realistic for you, so don’t forget about your friends as you ride the escalator of ambition. They can still bring you joy and freedom off the clock.","Your philosophical understanding of the world may be deepened today as you finally find the words to describe some of the emotional background noise you have long taken for granted. Though this discovery might initially be an exciting one, it could turn depressing if the result is a sudden, unavoidable understanding that there’s a lack of nurturing in your life. Still, identifying the problem is the first step to solving it, and experiencing even difficult feelings could be the key to unlocking your passion.","Deep insights can come to you today as you contemplate the mysteries of existence. Don’t be too disappointed if you try to communicate your findings to the people around you, yet they don’t seem to understand what is so clear in your own mind or why it is important. You may be better off thinking over your big ideas alone for now. Work to incorporate them into your larger view of the world, and as you do so, the details could become more solid.","You might take pride in your ability to build relationships within your community, but you could start to get the impression that people only want to be around you for what you can give them financially. Before you open your wallet to anyone else in the group, make sure that they currently have skin in the game too. You can see the value in a commitment that is truly shared, but feeling like everything is all on you will likely breed resentment.","Immersing yourself in the day-to-day details of your work may help you give voice to your larger ambitions, as you gain clarity on what you really have a talent for. The answer could surprise you, and it might even challenge how you see yourself. Asking someone you trust for their perspective may be helpful. Your surprise might turn out to be something that you were the last to know, as sometimes the things you take for granted stand out as remarkable to others.","Loose dreams of fitting more exploration and adventure into your life could get more detailed today. You may be more able than usual to express what would really make your heart sing -- even if the thought of actually doing anything is still overwhelming. While it could be hard to pin down exactly what’s holding you back, try taking the first practical steps toward whatever you are considering. That could at least show you what you need to resolve to move further."
2021-07-19,"Cozy emotional security may be ours today, but not without some costs. When the emotional Moon forms a peaceful trine with the radiant Sun at 12:30 pm EDT, we’ll want to know that the people around us are there to stay. The Moon also challenges Venus and Mars in fiery Leo, though, so passion may threaten the day’s calm. Meanwhile, communicator Mercury slams sensitive Chiron, and if we hold too much back, we could blurt out something regrettable.","You may have the sense that your family gives you stability on a deep level, even if you don’t like them very much at this moment. A cutting remark from a relative could make you feel that they don’t respect your right to be yourself. You might not be able to have the security of the clan’s approval and the harmony of following your own bliss at the same time, so choose whatever you can live with for the time being.","Your home life might be more lively than you think your neighbors would be comfortable with, so you may find yourself making an effort to convince others that you’re following the norms of your community. The feeling of being an outsider can take on a life of its own, so make sure that any fears are grounded in reality before you sink too deeply into them. The voice of judgment you hear may come from inside your own mind, rather than anyone else’s.","Finding financial security as well as emotional connection in your work could be possible. Of course, don’t forget to remain cautious about getting involved with office gossip or drama. Friendships in general might be challenging for you currently. While it may be tempting to build a social life with your co-workers because they’re always around to talk to, remember that you can’t easily leave if things go wrong. If you feel like you have to choose between safety and excitement, go with safety.","A financial risk may be enticing to you at this time. Though it might involve a truly creative idea of yours, there could also be a part of you wanting to impulsively assert yourself against an authority figure whom you feel has held or is holding you back. Maintaining an attitude of gratitude toward this person -- for at least providing a clear example of what you don’t want your life to be like -- can help your journey stay on a more productive track.","With today’s ambiguous energy, you may be conflicted about whether to rest or do something active. Starting off with resting might tempt you to ruminate on a negative view of the world and perhaps even fall deep into melancholy. However, burning off energy with physical activity could distract you from your problems and improve your mood. After that, you’ll likely feel ready to chill out, and your home can be a peaceful and relaxing place to meet that need.","Social interactions could be complex for you now. Though communication may flow easily on lighter topics, a feeling of restlessness could rise up if there doesn’t seem to be any opportunity to address heavier issues that weigh on you with the people in your circle. You may need to assess whether the expectations you have of these people are realistic. For now, you might be able to make more reliable progress on the tough stuff if you chew on it in solitude.","Your friends may be fun and exciting, but right now you could be wondering if you’re compatible with them, as they don’t seem to value the same things that you do. Even if you’re more interested than they are in having a secure and predictable life, there’s nothing wrong with having friends who are a window into paths not taken. If you find yourself very uncomfortable around them, ask yourself if you might be jealous of them. Acknowledging that possibility can guide your next steps.","Your basic views about the world can meld harmoniously with your personality and your sense of emotional security now. That said, your professional life might ask you to break out of this comfortable cocoon and take action. While putting your ideas to the test could lead to some disappointment in the short term, you will ultimately be better off knowing what does and doesn’t work. There probably are still parts of your plan that are solid, and you can pursue those with gusto.","Self-worth issues could be weighing on you today, but you have the potential to delve into the trauma that's at the root of them. Though you may prefer to keep your philosophy of life optimistic, it might be wiser to balance that by honestly experiencing your more difficult emotions about this situation. Although it could be hard to find the line between communicating your feelings and intellectualizing them, time alone will probably be helpful for sorting things out.","Controversial subjects may energize you at this time, but handling this intensity without disrupting your carefully planned life could be a challenge. Maintaining relationships with the peace and security you prefer will require a gentler touch, and playing it safe in your larger social network is probably sensible. If you find yourself crabby at home, you might have to trust someone there enough to lean on them and let out what’s really on your mind. Building intimacy in a safe environment may be just the transformation you need.","Professional ambitions could flourish as your hard work on daily tasks gets recognized at last. With the spotlight, however, comes increased scrutiny. You may enjoy the exciting energy that your work relationships bring to your life, but this passion has the potential to get out of hand. Careless office gossip could wind up really hurting someone. Be mindful of how you conduct yourself with others at the moment, and remember that you are there to do your job rather than find entertainment.","Today offers a boost to your sense of adventure, driving you to find something fun to do. Unfortunately, budget worries could dampen your excitement. If you can’t afford a certain pleasure, you might be tempted to catastrophize this small concern into a larger statement about your worth. A satisfying compromise could involve finding some entertainment hidden in plain sight. If you bring your creativity to your work and routine chores, you can get a lot done and also enjoy the experience."
2021-07-20,"Our mood is serious and reflective today as the Moon in Sagittarius moves in concert with somber Saturn and sensitive Chiron. From this stable foundation, we can embrace the inspiration coming from quick-witted Mercury’s sextile to innovative Uranus at 5:38 am EDT. Though this energy is creative, it happens in a way that seeks practical and tangible results. Remembering how we may not have always gotten the care we needed growing up can help us revolutionize the art of nurturing.","When you finally find a community where you feel like you belong, embracing this safety can sometimes be difficult, because wounds you stuffed down in the past may rise to the surface. Now, though, you might be able to find a philosophical framework in which what you suffered makes sense somehow. If this is comforting, you may be ready to update what security means to you. Though security through material possessions is not necessarily bad, understanding your emotional needs can give you a healthier attitude toward them.","You may be able to speak your truth more clearly than usual at this time. You might even be tempted to talk about what is really bothering you about an authority figure in your life. The issue may be much bigger than the person who is the focus of your frustration in the moment, and keeping this perspective in mind can help you be fair to that person. They, too, could be negatively impacted by some of the same pressures that weigh on you.","The relationships you form with people in your larger social network may be healing for you at this time, as they can provide connection that feeds both your intellect and your soul. The more routine side of your life, however, might be yours to work out on your own. For example, if a money issue has been weighing on you lately, the solution may be as simple as remembering something you forgot. Know when to crowdsource and when to trust your own intuition.","You may have some ambivalence about whether your job is right for you. Reflecting on why you have chosen to stay there so far can help you clarify what your next move should be. Luckily, your social life may be more obviously fulfilling at this time. A friend or acquaintance might even provide you with a new professional lead, and that opportunity could be worth pursuing. Alternately, you may come to appreciate what you already have if you get the sense the grass is not greener elsewhere.","Although committing to a partnership of any kind can make you feel tied down, it can also give you the security to really sink into addressing some of your deeper issues. You may need to work to let go of inhibitions that stem from an authority figure who was a destructive influence earlier in your life. This person might live on more in your mind than in the real world at this point, so focus on the reality of the close connections that are active in your life now.","Your commitments to your family or home may be extensive, but even the burdensome quality of your responsibilities there might give you a sense of purpose. It could even be a little scary to contemplate what you would be without all that. Even if your friendships and your intellectual passions feel like less valid uses of your time because you can’t see concrete accomplishment as easily, they have a lot to offer you now. Take a break to feed these needs if you can.","A steady commitment to another person, no matter what the type of relationship, could be making your basic personality seem more serious lately. Even if you are ambivalent about this change in yourself, if you have upheaval going on elsewhere in your life, you may appreciate having this person’s support in your corner. While the relationship’s dynamics might later become more relaxed, for now you can use the connection’s heavy energy to have the important conversations that you need.","You might be tempted to look for someone to blame if job frustrations come to a head; this focus could land on the family that you have to earn money to support. Whether or not this is an accurate view of your situation, you may need to move beyond resentment so you can access your capacity to find a creative solution. A good talk with someone who is not in the middle of the drama could help you see the bigger picture.","Attention to detail could uncover a surprise in a financial matter for you. Though the news is probably not anything bad, you are better off knowing it than being unaware. The situation may involve resources you share with someone else, but talking to them about it should go well. With the Moon in your sign today, you have a solid sense of yourself, so you are able to tell your side of the story clearly. Both of you can benefit from the resolution.","You can reach a new awareness now about how your upbringing formed the values that guide your life today. Perhaps keeping a big secret was so crucial to your family’s dynamics that you made a routine of tiptoeing around it. A current close relationship, however, may help you evaluate whether the conclusions you took from your early experiences are relevant to your present situation. You can honor the strength of your younger self and also adapt to how times have changed.","People in your social network may be able to rely on you today, as you are secure enough that you can offer support to others. Some might be especially eager to learn about your unique approach to a home or family situation. You've learned a lot over time, and you may not even realize that you've become an expert in the things you do regularly. It might be strange to now think of yourself as an authority in these areas, but nothing has changed -- you've just become more aware.","You may enjoy shocking the people around you now with exciting stories about yourself. You might even be capable of true genius in the sense of making something complex look effortless. While the foundation that's supporting your freewheeling adventures may be stronger than it appears, even you might not be aware of all its details. Today, as your ambitions vibe harmoniously with your deeper values, you can look under the hood and try to see what propels you on your path. This could bring lasting progress."
2021-07-21,"We can convert our passion into productivity as the emotional Moon and sensual Venus both move from inspired Fire signs into practical Earth signs. The Moon begins the day in Sagittarius, forming a trine with fortunate Venus, and finishes in Capricorn, creating a sextile with generous Jupiter. Meanwhile, Venus enters Virgo at 8:37 pm EDT, kicking off almost four weeks of encouragement to get the details right, even when doing so is tedious. While life’s excitement might slow down, accomplishment feels rewarding.","You may have an aptitude for making things beautiful now. Even if you usually live in your head, your capacity for physical craft gets a big boost today, so you might get more tangible results than usual in this area. This could get you a hit of positive attention in your career, but the bigger benefits may be less visible. If you see that you are capable of things that you didn’t think you were, it could push you to expand how you understand yourself.","Your creative powers could be approaching a peak, and today is a good opportunity to formulate the plan for something you would like to create. If necessary, get input from your friends or collaborators. At this point, you need to start with a clear understanding of the big picture. Though filling in the specific details will later be important, beginning with your focus there is likely to be unproductive. Instead, try to articulate the outcome you want.","Heavy issues can be daunting now, like figuring out your life’s purpose or the legacy you will leave behind one day. When you know you are not alone, though, even onerous tasks become easier. Starting today, Venus will be adding its grace to your family life for the next few weeks, so you might feel that those you consider kin are on your side and willing to help with what weighs on you. Tackle the tough stuff together while your home team is strong.","If there is something you have been putting off saying because you don’t know how to say it in a way that is not hurtful, you're in luck: Starting today and for the next few weeks, your good intentions can come across more easily in conversation. Before pointing out what needs improvement, just make sure you have a sense of how your complaint fits into the situation’s bigger picture. Sharing that will help the other person understand they are not being picked at for no reason.","Money matters can brighten up for you starting today. While you may already be paid at least as well as you expect for your regular work, you might also remember that tax forms often ask about sources of income other than that. This could be a very good time for you to just sit down and read a tax form for financial inspiration, as it might show that there is an additional income stream within reach that you have overlooked.","You could start to look and feel especially good as Venus enters your sign today. Even if nothing changes for you physically, you might wear a fresh boost of confidence well. When you approach your relationships with this positive attitude toward yourself, you can advocate for what you need. Others will likely respect you for your clarity and accommodate you beyond what you might expect. The hardest part of this success could be wondering why you didn’t see that it was possible sooner.","Rest can actually be productive for you now. Your home life and work might be humming around relatively smoothly, and in the ensuing calm, important gems you had overlooked when things were busier may rise into your awareness. This could happen through the process of dreaming, which digests your routine goings-on, but it can also take place while you are awake if you are quiet enough. Spending time in meditation or simple solitude could be very revealing.","Your social life could start hopping in the near future, but schedules may fill up fast. Sometimes the hard part of socializing is finding a date and location that works for everyone. Today is a great opportunity to set up that kind of infrastructure for the next few weeks, so reach out to your friends to find out what they have going on. Planning for the kind of fun you want to have makes it more likely to actually happen.","Your professional pursuits are being blessed by Venus, not just today but for the next few weeks, so start thinking about how you can optimize this time of increased visibility. What might be most appealing in the moment is thinking about how you could be financially rewarded for new career achievements. You may even carry the daydream further to consider how you could use extra money to make your home life more comfortable. Whatever works to motivate you, just make sure you back it up with action.","Expanding your horizons, whether physically or intellectually, may be favorable for you now. As you begin to discover a new philosophy, subject, or culture, you might start to realize that you seem to be connecting everything you learn back to your own personal experiences. While your focus can broaden over time, having new a vocabulary for talking about yourself could be what you need most right now, so just accept this self-absorption as part of your process.","You may find others repaying debts they owe you or returning items they borrowed from you while fortunate Venus illuminates the issue of shared property for you. It's not all up to Venus though -- you can also help yourself by making a list of the unresolved exchanges you can remember and planning to follow up on them. If the other person is embarrassed by how long it has been, they could be relieved if you initiate the conversation.","Fresh energy is coming to your close relationships, starting today. While losing yourself in a partnership of some kind could be tempting, this moment is asking you to see how building connections with others can help you grow as an individual. One way to avoid engulfment could be for you and the other person to have a commitment to some cause outside of the relationship together. When it is clear the world is bigger than the two of you, you can maintain perspective."
2021-07-22,"Sunlight may be the best disinfectant for our messes today. As assertive Mars is blocked by withholding Pluto, using manipulation or passive aggression to get our needs met could be tempting. However, desire-focused Venus mingles with expansive Jupiter, and we might be able to simply ask for what we want and get it. It’ll be quite difficult to hide the truth anyway once the Sun enters flamboyant Leo at 10:26 am EDT, so we can embrace the relief of letting it all hang out!","Work can go well for you at this time -- if you allow it to. You might have a lot of good things going for you, but somehow all you see is the other people you perceive as holding you back. Be careful, because playing underhanded games to get ahead is likely to backfire on you. If you must find an outlet for your strong urge to compete, focus on competing with yourself. When you do your own best, you can really shine.","You may have a lot of ideas for improving your home and family life currently. Try to own these proposals as things that resonate with you personally rather than portraying them as things that must be done because an authority figure said so. The other people involved might get on board if you talk honestly with them about your own experiences, but they are likely to be repelled if they feel like you are pushing or manipulating them into participating.","A situation where you share money or other resources with someone else could be complicated by mixed messages at this time. The lustrous Sun is shining a spotlight on your capacity for communication, though, so start by taking the opportunity to ask the other person openly and directly for what you need. If it becomes obvious that you aren’t going to get your needs met in your present arrangement, other options could be more rewarding for you. You’ll be better off knowing, either way!","Someone else may have a big idea for how you should spend your money. Before you give in, think through whether this person has the right to demand that. Starting today, there's an intense focus on your money and other possessions for the next month, so this is a good time to get clear about what belongs to you and not others. Meanwhile, gentle Venus can now support your ability to communicate your perspective kindly, so people might understand if you must tell them no.","Financial matters may feel more comfortable than usual for you at the moment. Especially if the money connections you have with others are in a good place, you might feel like you can spend a little extra on yourself. With the dazzling Sun moving into your sign, you could be especially aware of your own needs and inclined to pursue them. Make sure you don’t let the positive vibes carry you into manipulating your way out of your legitimate responsibilities, but otherwise, enjoy the moment!","There could be someone you want to get to know better. Whether this budding connection is in the domain of friendship, business, or anything else, making the first move can be scary. However, if you’re perceived as hovering awkwardly around them or trying to engineer behind the scenes so you meet again, you might scare them away. Just be direct in your approach to this person. If you can give them a genuine compliment, they may be more willing to engage than you thought.","You might be more engaged with your larger social network than usual at this time. When you pay close attention to what is going on in the lives of your friends and acquaintances, unfortunately, jealousy can creep in. Be careful not to take this peer pressure out on your family by trying to push them into someone else’s mold. While it may be true that your friends’ families do some things differently than yours, that is not always relevant to addressing your family’s unique challenges.","Professional matters may come into focus for you as the energetic Sun moves into your career sector today. If you’re stewing because you think you asked for a raise or other desirable item at work that you didn’t get, you might want to review how that interaction actually happened. Did you use your words when you made your request, or did you just drop hints? Watching how your peers handle similar situations could help you refine your approach to getting what you need.","You may be very passionate about your view of the world at this time, and it could really upset you if others don’t see things in the same way you do. While you might be tempted to use money to manipulate people onto your side, devoting your energy to improving the foundation of your personal life is much more likely to bring you lasting success. If what you are doing produces positive results, people will see that and probably want to be part of it.","You may be holding something important back today, particularly in a negotiation over a shared resource, because that is what you feel you must do to protect yourself. While you might not be able to avoid collaborating with others as the willful Sun illuminates your connective 8th house, you can push yourself to get better at telling your side of the story. Your words might be received more kindly than you expect, so the biggest battle could be building your own confidence.","The energy of other people in your life could be strong at this time, and you may feel like you’re just reacting to whatever they do rather than driving events yourself. If you are tempted to be financially generous in the midst of this atmosphere, you might ask yourself if you’ve attached some strings to whatever gift you would like to give. While giving has its own pleasures, it cannot fix a situation where you are not getting your needs met.","The exchanges in your relationships may feel comfortable for you today, as the people you interact closely with seem to share your interest in the pursuit of pleasure. You might, however, be reluctant to raise concerns about practical issues, because such talk could disrupt the harmony of the moment. While a lot of work can wait, some frustrations are better talked out right away than suppressed. Try to read the energy of the room and know what is worth addressing."
2021-07-23,"Emotions can be hard to put into words, but as the deeply private Moon opposes communicator Mercury, today we can give it our best shot. Our motives, however, might be suspect, as the Moon also meets manipulative Pluto. After Luna moves into detached Aquarius for the Full Moon at 10:37 pm EDT, we might be frustrated with power struggles and just want direct answers. We should try to clearly identify the outcome we want, even if the steps to get there are not yet obvious","You may be willing to share more of yourself than normal with your friends today. Still, keep in mind your motives for opening up. It’s true that telling people about your background can give them a better context for understanding your quirks. However, people could feel resentful if you’re trying to get out of trouble in the present by manipulating them with sad stories from your childhood -- even if they give you what you want in the moment out of guilt. Choose your words wisely.","Communication could be intense at this time, as even routine matters seem to touch on deep philosophical issues. Your strongest energy can be found in your inner life, so don’t be surprised if you wind up showing a more personal side of yourself than usual in public. You might also finally be able to put an emotional component of your opinions into words. While this may not be the only reason you hold those views, it could be a very valuable insight for you.","Today you could find yourself torn between enjoying the people around you in your usual lighthearted way and pursuing things that you personally find intellectually fulfilling. However, trying to do both at the same time might be more possible than you think! You could learn something new about the people you tend to take for granted -- if you take the risk of letting them into your deeper side. While that might make it tempting to blurt out everything you’ve held back, open the door gently.","Speaking up may help defuse a power struggle quietly brewing in one of your close relationships. Part of the problem might be a money issue, but that particular aspect could be closer to a solution than you think if you just talk to the other person. What could require more work is unraveling the atmosphere of secrecy that made it hard to initiate the conversation. Start by seriously asking yourself whether you are always a safe person for others to talk to.","Someone in your life may seem to be overly dependent on you. Surprising circumstances, however, could reveal that the dependency is not as one-sided as it might appear. Your sign is known for its love of attention, and being endlessly needed by someone -- in even an obnoxious or burdensome way -- is still a form of receiving their attention. Even if the other person really is out of line, try to look for the ways in which you may be contributing to the dynamic.","You could feel very emotionally attuned to some of the undercurrents in your peer relationships today. Maybe a social situation you’ve been rationalizing really does hurt your feelings, no matter how much you logically understand the other party’s position. While this realization could hit you so dramatically that you want to do something about it right away, you might need to reflect privately for a while to figure out the next steps that will actually be helpful. Think before you act.","If power dynamics in your career have become overwhelming, you might ask yourself if you’re reacting to something other than ongoing events at your workplace. Someone currently involved in your work who reminds you of challenges in your childhood could be triggering you in ways that are not necessarily their fault. Your friends may be able to give you a helpfully detached perspective on the drama, and just being recognized as an equal peer can help you get back on track.","You may be getting noticed more than usual in your career, but you might not be as happy about it as you would have expected. Early experiences of competing with your siblings or other childhood peers, where any achievement of yours seemed to come at the expense of someone else being vocally upset, could be coming back to haunt you. To fully embrace the opportunities available to you now, you may need to identify what would help you feel safe while being successful.","Being seen as a cosmopolitan adventurer or as a philosopher who ponders deep mysteries could be a reputation you really enjoy having. However, that may also make it harder for you to embrace the part of yourself that actually likes the more routine side of life. Make an adventure of discovering the things in your immediate surroundings that you’ve dismissed as boring. You might learn something about what makes you personally feel secure. That knowledge is important too, whether or not anyone else is impressed.","Communicating in a close relationship could be frustrating for you at the moment. You might feel like you’re seen as the bad guy, while from your perspective, you aren’t given the opportunity to be anything else. If you respond to this pressure by throwing your weight around on a money issue, though, you might just dig yourself in deeper. Instead, try to be as forthright as you can regarding financial matters. Defying your reputation as the problem person could disrupt any unpleasant dynamics.","Picking at someone in your life over petty things may be tempting. The more they try to respond to your complaints and please you, though, the more you might find that they could improve. If what you really need right now is for them to reassure you that they care for you and won’t leave you, just say so. A direct approach is more likely to be successful than manipulation, and it can inspire the other person to be candid with you in return.","Difficult dynamics in a social group could provoke you to question whether your devotion to this group is reciprocated. You may take pride in your ability to serve the needs of the people you care about, but it’s okay if you need to spend some time today reflecting on what you’re giving and what you hope to get out of it. Even if others in your circle could be more appreciative of your efforts, you might have unrealistic expectations of them in return."
2021-07-24,"Our ability to pick up information of all kinds is supercharged today as intellectual Mercury forms a helpful trine with intuitive Neptune at 12:35 pm EDT. Meanwhile, the emotional Moon unites with cold Saturn to embrace a moderate and idealistic approach to our personal needs. Luna is also, however, challenged by provocative Uranus to honor the demands of our physical, sensual bodies. The more we push toward one direction, the more we may be tempted to rebel in the other.","Your peer group may seem to have high standards right now, and a critical eye toward those who fall short of them. Before you commit yourself to a serious effort to meet their lofty ideals, take a moment to determine whether you actually think doing so is worth it. Reflecting on your roots can help you identify what you really value. Even if that is something different from the crowd’s enthusiasm of the moment, they might come to respect you for being true to yourself.","An authority figure whom you expect to be serious, like a boss or parent, might have turned up the dial to painfully serious lately. While it can take a lot to push a placid Taurus to rebel, even you could be feeling the urge now. Others may be secretly hoping that you will shake things up, especially if they don’t have the courage to do it themselves. Do your best to read the room and see how much support you have before you take action.","You may feel proudly certain of your philosophical understanding of the world, but you might also be secretly troubled by an internal voice of doubt that grows louder the more you try to shout it down. Reflecting on the example of someone you idealize could give you some perspective on your dilemma. Identifying what specifically you admire about that person may help you articulate what is really important to you, and you can then refine your own strategy from that place of clarity.","Your friends could be exciting now, perhaps because they are intentionally making an effort to pull you out of your shell. You might wonder, though, if their drive to liberate you from some perceived repression is more about them than it is about you. You can humor them and go along with it if you want, but if it gets to the point where you need to talk some sense into them, today you are equipped to get your point across powerfully but gently.","Someone you are in a close relationship with might not be going anywhere, but you could feel so emotionally neglected and misunderstood by them that the stability of their presence is little consolation. Is your feeling of emotional distance only about that person, though, or are you piling on to them an experience of being let down by a parental figure in your past? You may need to examine your ideas of nurturing and look at what is realistic for you to expect from anyone.","While your social scene may be getting more active now, your efforts to turn acquaintances into friends could frustrate and confuse you. It can be hard to tell the difference between someone who flippantly says, “We should hang out,” and someone who actually wants to spend more time with you. This ambiguity could tempt you to flee into the security of your more predictable responsibilities. However, pushing yourself to look at the big picture of how you understand relationships could lead you to unexpected insights.","You could be making progress in your career now, thanks at least in part to your attunement to the subtle dynamics of your work. Turning that gentle approach toward yourself, however, could be harder for you, as you may hold yourself to oppressively high standards. Opening up to emotional intimacy with someone in your life might help you break through some of your inhibitions. Be mindful, however; the more repressed you are, the more you may be tempted to go wild at the first opportunity.","Home could be stable for you at this time, but you may find that the dynamic there lacks the emotional intimacy you need. You might want to really connect with someone, whether they are in your family or not, but you fear that would disturb the peace. In your concern about how everyone else in your life relates to each other, however, you might have lost track of where you are in all of this. This could be a good time to step back and get some perspective.","A money or property matter may require you to get some information out of your family, even if they are normally reticent to discuss such topics. You can still be sensitive while getting the facts you need, but you might have to keep your focus to some very specific questions you have thought through in advance. A more open-ended approach could be perceived as threatening, especially if the person you are talking to feels shame about the situation. Emphasize that you are not judging them.","Communication in a close relationship could be frustrating for you, as you may feel like the other person is pushing you to pin down answers you can’t give. Be honest about what you don’t know, but you might know more than you think you do if you just start talking. Your own internal conflict between what you value and which way of expressing yourself feels most rewarding could also be holding you back from being fully candid. Try to go with the flow.","You might seem like the serious one in your home or family now, but maybe you feel railroaded into that role because someone else there is unstable. While you may truly value compassion and have a gift for putting it into action at this time, try to maintain a sense of the goal you are hoping to achieve. If you lack clarity about what you are doing and why, you could get taken advantage of. You can accomplish a lot within reasonable limits.","Expressing yourself to get attention may be tempting for you today, but you could get in trouble if you tell someone else’s secrets to get a quick hit of excitement. You can be entertaining to others without causing problems if you focus on the stories that are truly yours to tell. Telling your own stories may, in turn, help you get a clearer sense of your own identity. While labels might be hard to pin down now, no one can take away your experiences."
2021-07-25,"Information is desirable today, but it could come with some costs. As inquisitive Mercury opposes withholding Pluto at 4:15 pm EDT, we may struggle to find a balance between excavating things that really need to be known and respecting each other’s boundaries. Meanwhile, the sensitive Moon makes a touchy opposition with aggressive Mars, so we might also feel threatened more easily than usual. When Luna moves into Pisces and meets Jupiter, however, we may at least be able to acknowledge that others mean well.","News or social media disputes could set you off at this time, and this does not make you petty. Many political controversies come down to serious questions about how to meet people’s needs without controlling them. This is a major challenge of parenting as well, so it's possible you are reacting to today’s provocations based on your own childhood memories of being oppressed or neglected. You might need to intentionally take space from this and rest -- you can find peace if you do.","You may be obsessed with a favorite author, mentor, or spiritual leader, to the point that your family is tired of hearing you talk about them. Though feeling separate from your family might be hard for you, try not to take it as a personal attack that they don’t share all your passions. If you just follow your interest where it leads you, you might find that your friends are happy to join you, and you could even meet new friends along the way.","You may want to know all the details about a money matter, and you might be frustrated that someone else involved seems to be withholding information. Try to be realistic about what is truly necessary for you to know right this second, though. If at least some of it can wait a little while, the other person may be able to give you a more complete story later. The more they feel pushed, the less likely you are to get what you need.","Someone close could seem to be hiding something from you, and the more you try to get it out of them, the more they resist. This might make you paranoid, but try to view the situation from another perspective -- maybe they admire you more than you know and are scheming to impress you in some grandiose way. Appreciating that the other person may not have bad intentions could help you interact with them kindly rather than suspiciously.","Today you may need to try extra hard to be aware of hidden dynamics in your routine responsibilities because it could be easy for you to unintentionally hurt people’s feelings. Once you start looking, you may pick up on an overwhelming amount of information that had been hiding in plain sight. It might be challenging to find the middle ground between being a bull in a china shop and becoming so sensitive that you can’t move forward, but err on the side of gentleness.","Relationships can go well for you now if you let them, but getting past your own inhibitions may be the hard part. You might be active socially today, talking to a lot of your friends and acquaintances and asking them questions about themselves. If you don’t reveal anything about yourself, however, the exchanges could start to feel lopsided. Remember to think of your conversations as connections rather than as boxes to check off as completed, and have the courage to truly connect.","Inhibitions dating back to your early life may come to the surface as you push forward toward progress in your career. Trying to get a handle on the big issues involved could overwhelm you, and asking your friends for advice might only add a layer of confusion to the situation. The day-to-day tasks of your job or lifestyle may be more immediately rewarding, and you can do them well. You need an easy win now, so focus on what gives you gratification in the moment.","Your mind may be set on big ideas now, so you could come off more intense than people are equipped to deal with if they were expecting small talk. Feeling like you need to choose between being accepted and pursuing what really excites you could trigger some anxiety about being abandoned. If you embrace having fun alone, however, you may paradoxically find that others want to join you. They could be more open to your intensity if given space to approach it on their own terms.","Filling out even routine forms about financial matters could aggravate you today, as the questions seem overly intrusive. You might feel like someone is trying to tell you how to spend your money or even threatening your autonomy more broadly. Try to focus on what the form actually says rather than what you think it says, though. While you may have valid reasons for feeling threatened or defensive, whoever you are dealing with now might not be part of that drama.","The more someone else picks at you today, the more you may want to withdraw into yourself -- and the more you stonewall them, the more agitated they become. You might feel defensive because you perceive they are coming for your money or other resources. If you can bring yourself to talk to them, though, you may be able to share your side of the story in a way that they find understandable. Even if you can’t give them everything they want, this could help.","Collaborating with others on routine work or chores may be frustrating today, as you seem to hit the snag of someone else’s sensitivity no matter what you do. You just want things to be done right, and you might start to wonder if this person is intentionally acting offended to bully you. Whatever is motivating them, you are probably better off focusing on increasing the resources that belong to only you. Having things of your own can get you some needed space.","Social situations could be murky for you today. You may have thought the goal was to connect for a good time, but that might not go as planned. What people are really in the mood for could differ from the official agenda, and a conflict or upset may need to be aired out before you can move forward. If you are able to read the room well enough to discern this, you may be appreciated for being the peacemaker."
2021-07-26,"We may value practical achievement, even as emotional security seems to be somewhere else. As the sensitive Moon makes a challenging opposition to finance-focused Venus at 9:04 am EDT, we could feel conflicted about how important money really is. The Moon also tangles with the assertive Sun, so we might have to decide between following the socially rewarding path of serving others and taking the risk of following our own bliss. Getting everything we want at the same time is unlikely.","The attention to detail you display in your work can get you some positive recognition today. Though you may secretly wish you were resting or doing something more fun, sometimes showing up and taking care of business even when you don’t feel like it makes a wonderful difference for others in your life. You might ultimately need to find a balance between this sort of duty and meeting your more personal needs, but for now, you can take pride in your accomplishments.","Today you may become aware that what you truly find fun is different from your usual routine with your friends. This could cause you anxiety about keeping your place in the group, but it’s also worth considering that you might not be the only one who has a more private self -- one that’s at odds with the side you show in public. Going out on a limb and asking if anyone else wants to change things up could be worth a try.","Beautifying your home often feels good, but you could find yourself worrying that spending time on such things makes you shallow. Achieving out in the world might seem to be a more reliable source of security than something only you may see. Talking to others could just complicate your efforts to figure out what is best for you, so try listening to your own inner voice. Still, you’ll probably hear it better in an environment that is clean and decorated to your taste.","Your philosophical or spiritual understanding of the world is probably emotionally comforting to you. If you want to talk to others about it, communicating kindness will be key to getting a receptive audience for your views. Making the effort to explain out loud the things you take for granted can push you to evaluate whether your beliefs are in line with what you actually value at this moment. If you don’t like the way you sound, your philosophy may be due for a tune-up.","It’s nice to be seen as generous, but you might not be handed that designation for free today. Someone you’re trying to help could seem endlessly dependent, to the point that no matter what you give, it is never enough. You might start to wonder what you have to do to fulfill your obligation and be seen as a good person. In the end, if someone has that much power to determine your goodness, you may need to look at who’s really the dependent one.","You may have been looking forward to spending time with someone close, however, as the moment approaches, you might feel inclined to rest instead. If you’ve been busy trying to impress people and make new connections lately, you might not have a lot of energy left for those who've always been there. Even though they may understand your need to recharge, it's probably wise to use that downtime to reflect on what you can do to have more balance in your relationships going forward.","Focusing on your real-world responsibilities may seem safer than letting passion into your life at this time. Of course, you still could have some excitement brewing in secret -- perhaps you like things remaining private for now. While your friends might be more ready than you are to see your sensual side, it’s your life! You should be able to move at a pace that you’re comfortable with. Stay grounded in your routine, and then you can look for room to work the fun stuff in.","Today you may be both popular with your friends and admired in your career. The increased attention, however, could feel more worrisome than comforting. You might realize that you feel more secure when you pursue the things that bring you personal joy, as those passions are not vulnerable to the unpredictable whims of others. While trusting others is scary, though, sometimes it can lead to good results for everyone. This might be a time to take the risk and let yourself shine.","It’s okay to crave some quiet time at home today, even if you usually enjoy the attention you get for your reputation as someone who goes on exciting adventures. The people who salivate over your stories wouldn’t want you getting yourself run down on their account. If you can make peace with what you think of as your boring side, you can get some replenishing rest. That might be just what you need to fuel your next round of adventure!","Adventure is calling you! Unfortunately, getting it to happen may be hard to balance with your responsibilities toward others. How you think or talk about the dilemma could make all the difference. For instance, you may have it in your head that taking a class or going on a trip would cut into time you need to spend with others who are important to you, but maybe they could accompany you as a fun bonding activity! A little creativity can help you problem-solve.","Someone close to you may give you a generous gift, which could trigger anxiety about being dependent on others. While you might worry that accepting the gift will disrupt the equilibrium of the relationship, rejecting it could be even more jarring. You may need to confront the idea that total independence is the only way you can achieve security. While having your own resources is important, so is having the flexibility to adjust to the rhythm of a fluid human relationship.","Your emotions may be close to the surface with the tender Moon in your sign today, and opening up to others about your needs could get you support. While you might wonder if you should be spending time on a big conversation while your responsibilities lurk, it would be wise to take the opportunity to be heard if you can get it. Duty can often wait, and coming back to it after shedding some emotion could lead to a surge in productivity."
2021-07-27,"Our dreams can play in tune with the collective today as the intuitive Moon taps into the three outermost planets: innovative Uranus, visionary Neptune, and transformative Pluto. It may, however, be hard to grab hold of our own personal thoughts until intellectual Mercury moves into individualistic Leo at 9:12 pm EDT. Mercury then grates against grandiose Jupiter, so we may have big, unrealistic ideas that could be fun, as long as we don’t get too attached!","You might get a lot out of rest at this time, even though your sign is usually known for being constantly on the go. Several years’ worth of accumulated lost sleep could actually be a reasonable explanation for the concentrated dream power available to you now. If you have an artistic outlet, the imagery of your dreams, which digest both personal and collective influences, could inspire your next work. You need a way to express everything you have taken in lately.","A social media or internet binge may be exciting for you at this time, and you could have a serious goal in mind: collecting ideas for freshening up your residence. Starting today, Mercury will fuel your capacity to think about domestic topics. Just keep your browsing in perspective, as not everything you see online is as easy as it looks. If you can find a tip that is quickly executable, though, that could give you the motivation you need to continue your project!","You may be tempted to use some flamboyant flair in your professional communications at this time. Having a little fun is okay, and you might collect an audience who enjoys the diversion. Your view of your own capabilities could be inflated to match your rhetoric, though, so be careful not to make promises you can’t keep. Simply do your best to help the people around you rediscover the passion that motivates their work. The practical details can, and should, wait until another day.","Broadening your horizons, like with a trip or a continuing education class, could be appealing to you now. Better yet, having something exciting to save up for may be the kick you need to get your finances in order. Fortunately, starting today, clever Mercury will boost your ability to think through money matters for the next couple of weeks. Competing with yourself can be a great motivator, so try coming up with several small goals. You can celebrate when you meet each one!","With Mercury entering your sign today, this is a good time to update your social media presence. Even though adding new content is exciting, remember that older posts exist as well. You might need to dig deeper than usual through your past photos and updates as you decide what to do with them. While there is value in being able to see your journey over time, there may also be things that no longer serve you or anyone else involved. Let the record reflect everyone’s best self.","A budding new relationship could be exciting for you, whether the context is business, friendship, or anything else. Still, keep your wits about you! There could be important information about the other person that you don’t know yet. While you don’t need to go wild researching them, take things slowly instead of rushing into any commitments. If they’re truly a good connection, they should give you the time and the details of their story that you need to make an informed decision.","Vague health complaints could be on your mind right now, and researching them online might be hard to resist. You may also be interested in sharing with others things that have helped you in the past. While it is human for people to connect and swap experiences, maintain a sense of perspective about the information you give and receive. Be wary of anyone who seems to be trying to push you into something, and offer your own advice with a grain of salt as well.","You probably want to focus on having fun today, but you could wind up dealing with demands from work even if it’s your day off. While this might be annoying, it may also help you approach a tedious problem from a fresh perspective, as playfulness can improve your capacity to be creative. Bringing more of that bright energy into your work could be a good thing over time, but be patient if you don’t get the balance right on your first try.","You might idealize parts of your background, but current family conflicts over politics and religion could tarnish those happy memories. Try to find common ground at least theoretically in your own mind, even if you aren’t ready to talk to the people you’re upset with. You may still share common values with them on a deeper level, yet you have very different ideas for achieving the same goals. To figure out which ideas are the best, look at what gets practical results.","No matter how much communication and information is around you now, it might not lead to clarity yet. Mercury could be nudging you to look at complicated matters like taxes and investments for the next couple of weeks. If all you can manage today is to get the appropriate file folders out of storage or set up the forms online, that’s still a start! The overwhelming nature of the process should lessen if you take things slowly and ask for help when you need it.","You might be interested in impressing someone important to you, and boasting about money could seem like an effective way to do it, especially if you’re feeling optimistic about your finances at this time. Committing to something you can’t back up, however, will not end well for you. Being your own straightforward self might be scary, but it is less likely to blow up in your face than big talk or empty promises. The other person could be kinder to you than you expect.","Rebooting your body may be appealing to you now, but the details of making it happen could get in the way. Perhaps a diet or exercise program is too demanding to fit into your life, or the hairstyle of your dreams requires too much maintenance. There may be a change out there that is right for you, but before you commit to anything, have a realistic sense of what you can actually live with. Test any new idea against that standard."
2021-07-28,"We may be in an expansive mood today, and taking risks that looked too big not that long ago could bring us encouraging results. At 8:43 am EDT, big-dreaming Jupiter returns to the quirky and social sign of Aquarius, fueling an atmosphere of innovation and connection from now until late December. Meanwhile, the emotional Moon makes harmonious trines with both intellectual Mercury and the active Sun today. While we might be going places, the pace of action is merciful enough that we can digest it.","You may be equipped to optimize your enjoyment of your social life at this time. Though Jupiter can give you fresh opportunities to connect with others, what you bring to the connection matters too. Instead of just going with the flow, take the risk of letting your friends in on what really makes you happy. Today you may be better able than usual to explain what brings you pleasure. You might get more of what you want if you ask for it, so go for it!","Something as simple as cleaning up around the house could get surprisingly intense at this time, as you might find yourself wandering off into deep thoughts about your background. As you set up your current home or family life to meet your needs, you may be reminded of situations in the past where you did not get what you needed. Starting today, Jupiter is compelling you to revisit your authority issues. If you are able to be the authority now, that may help you heal some old wounds.","You can have everything you want except quiet today, as Jupiter begins boosting your capacity for big ideas and exploration. Fortunately, you may have plenty of people around you to share your current brainstorms with, and your friends and even acquaintances might be in the mood for hearing something unique. A great idea can take on a life of its own beyond its creator, so be open to the possibility that feedback from your listeners could help improve and refine your plans.","A look at your finances may get you wondering how you can increase them. Your mind might first go to the obvious sources of money, like your career, and maybe adjustments in your favor could be made there. With Jupiter now supporting matters of shared resources for you, though, there may also be other income streams you haven’t thought about in a while that are worth looking into. Any financial arrangement that you have allowed to go on autopilot is a candidate for review.","Relationships may be important to you at this time, but you might enjoy them more if you make an effort to assert yourself. While it is common for people to learn from each other, a dynamic where someone else is continually lording their expertise over you could get tiresome. Sometimes people who do that are motivated to dominate conversations by their fear of silence, so you might help balance the equation if you intentionally open up about your own thoughtful and adventurous side.","You may be considering an unconventional arrangement for sharing resources with others. It could work, but push yourself to be realistic about the details. As a Virgo, you might be more responsible and hardworking than others to begin with, and starting today, Jupiter is fueling your idealization of duty even further. While it is fine for your collaboration to include sweat equity, be cautious of the risk of burnout. Instead of figuring everything out in your own head, actively solicit input from the others involved.","Fun might be easy to come by today, as your social life could be broadly active. Even better, you may be able to spin the merriment in a way that lets you build emotional connections with people as individuals. If there is someone in your larger posse whom you have always wanted to get to know better, this could be the day to go for it. Your lighthearted and casual approach may lower the inhibitions that prevented this from happening sooner.","Developing a big idea for your career is hard, but today, you might get a handle on the hardest part: seeing how to get there from where you are now. Being attuned to the details of your daily responsibilities can help you figure out how to shift them into a trajectory that goes somewhere. You have to accept where you are before you can change it, but even a really basic foundation of security may help you feel safe enough to expand from there.","You may be catching up on your backlog of reading or exploring, and a realization might be coming into view: there is a difference between the brain food that is currently trendy and that which you personally enjoy. While there can be value in having a basic idea of what your peers are into, don’t force yourself to stick with something that's just not your style. Jupiter is helping your communication skills starting today, so telling people what you do like could go well for you.","When you think about resources that are shared in a family context, it may not only be about dollars and cents. Shifting your mindset to be more encompassing could help you finesse a situation in a way that honors the emotional needs of everyone involved. The idea of scarcity always makes things worse, no matter what the numbers actually are. An attitude of abundance -- that there will ultimately be enough to go around -- can help bring about a kind and productive solution.","Your close relationships may be full of activity now, but you might want more than chatter for its own sake. With Jupiter back in your sign starting today, you can become a more powerful presence than usual, so you will probably succeed in requesting a deeper heart-to-heart if you think that needs to happen. You might also be equipped to really access the roots of your emotional dynamics without being heavy-handed. Though the ball is in your court, this conversation could help the other person, too.","You may feel secure that your regular work is earning you enough money to meet your needs. However, starting today, fortunate Jupiter is increasing the possibility that you might get secret or unexpected help, so you might have more than just your own effort on your side. Sometimes the seeming unfairness of life actually goes in your favor, but keep up your rhythm of attending to your responsibilities anyway. While luck is capricious, you have control over what you contribute."
2021-07-29,"Today’s energy is strong, and we may eventually use it to get things done. Assertive Mars in Leo goads expansive Jupiter with an opposition for one last grand show of flamboyant expression this morning. We can enjoy the excitement until Mars moves into detail-oriented and practical Virgo at 4:32 pm EDT, pushing us to buckle down and start working. Supporting that serious vibe, the emotional Moon interacts with sensitive Chiron and taskmaster Saturn, keeping us aware of the problems we need to address.","You could be feeling down on yourself in general at the moment, but knowing you have a secure role in a community you belong to may reduce the pressure you feel in other areas of your life. Appreciate this group with gratitude and have fun with them if you can. Starting today, Mars may get your nose to the grindstone, encouraging you to focus on practical work. Having concrete achievements you can point to might also boost your self-esteem.","An authority figure may be upsetting you now, but the reason might not be entirely what you think it is. Even if they were out of line, you could also be seeing their actions through the filter of your own issues. A current conflict between work and home might trigger memories of challenges your parents had when you were a child, for example. Actively pursuing something that makes you personally feel good can help you stay grounded in the present moment.","You may have a keen eye at this time toward everything you feel society is doing wrong, and you could be argumentative as you share this critical view with others. You might, however, be more successful in making change happen if you narrow your focus to your own family. Starting today, the energy of Mars can be channeled into improving your home and domestic life. If you can convince others in your household to support you rather than push them, you can get a lot done.","Collaborating to share resources with someone else could ultimately bring stability to your life, but working out the details may be difficult at the moment. You might find yourself easily triggered by some component of the situation that reminds you of a difficult past experience you had with authority. This feeling could be useful information, yet you may need to explore it further. With Mars revving up your communications beginning today, you might come off more aggressive than you intend, so try to think before you speak.","Pain sometimes comes not so much from reality as it does from the gap between reality and your expectations. If you feel unhappy in one of your close companionships, this could be a sign that your experience is clashing with your idea of what this relationship should look like. Try to clarify what you really value in life and consider what connections that support those values would look like. This may help you determine whether your pain is coming from your reality or from your expectations.","Routine work or chores may not be entirely straightforward today. In the course of unsnarling whatever is obstructing you there, you might come across something that disturbs you. This discovery could make clear that you have been letting something that really needs guidance coast on autopilot for too long. Cleaning up the mess may require you to assert yourself more than you are comfortable with, but once you get rolling, you might see other situations where a more assertive approach could help you.","A close relationship may feel uncomfortably serious for you today. Though you might see it as your duty to support a loved one who's going through a rough time, you also need to find a way to meet your own needs in the midst of helping them so you don’t burn out. Connecting with a less intense social circle could help relieve the pressure on you for the moment, but in the longer term, you may need to find a way to work rest into your routine.","Solving a problem in your home or family may require serious and focused effort today, but you will probably feel relieved once you have accomplished what needs to happen. As Mars -- an especially significant planet for Scorpio -- begins to support your social life today, you might find that your friends are able to help you deal with whatever is weighing on you. Alternately, you may be able to help others by sharing what you learn from conquering your current challenge.","An opportunity to express more creativity in your work might not look how you expect it to look. While creativity is often idealized as a totally freeform and unrestricted experience, you may have to allow some limits to your artistic process in order to produce a tangible result. Starting today, Mars can boost your professional ambition, so be aware of how your current output will contribute to the larger growth of your career. Accepting reasonable constraints might actually help you move forward.","While keeping your household going does require you to maintain a focus on financial matters, you could also benefit from keeping an eye on the bigger picture now. With Mars supporting your intellectual pursuits beginning today, this may be a good time for you to read up on how others have handled budgeting challenges similar to your own. You might discover that there is more room in your life than you thought for new experiences and affordable adventure.","You might be more equipped than usual to tell your own story at this time, especially the hard parts. Starting today, Mars is pushing you to confront challenging parts of life you may have avoided. Even if you think your situation sounds depressing, someone who hears you may benefit from your courage in airing the things that are often swept under the rug. Addressing the topic at all might be a bigger hurdle than finding the perfect words, but you can now do both.","Resolving a money gap may not be as simple as you hope right now. Though your first instinct could be to work harder to earn more, the problem might not have anything to do with your work ethic. More likely, there could be a hidden leak draining your funds so that they are not used in the way that's most beneficial to you. As Mars begins to influence your close relationships today, you may need to confront someone else about their role in the situation."
2021-07-30,"What brings our physical bodies pleasure may conflict with how we think the world should work as sensual Venus and structure-focused Saturn tangle in a frustrating quincunx at 12:27 pm EDT. We might not be able to satisfy everyone, but we can keep moving forward! The caring Moon sets our pace with a fortunate sextile to optimistic Jupiter, before settling into cozy Taurus. Once there, her supportive trine to hardworking Mars encourages us to feel good at the end of a long day.","Responsibilities may get in the way of hanging out with your friends, but surprisingly, you could be relieved to have that interruption -- work might actually be more fun for you right now! Powering through your task list can give you instant gratification you can clearly see, while a social dynamic where you aren't quite sure what is expected of you or whether you have managed to deliver it could be frustrating. Your labor may also be financially rewarding, so pursue it with gusto.","You may be in tune with what really makes you feel good today, and feel the desire to bring that joy into your public persona. The hardest part for you could be worrying that you're somehow going against the pronouncements of an authority figure. Before you retreat back into your shell, consider how recently the authority figure said that. Times have changed in many ways, so the voice of disapproval may be primarily in your own head at this point.","Admitting to enjoying your home or family life just the way it is right now could be hard for you, especially if it doesn't match ideas you got from experts or your peers about what it should look like. While there may be things you could do to give your household room to grow and improve, competing with others in this regard is likely to do more harm than good. You can gather information from others as long as you keep all input in perspective.","Your ability to communicate may be more powerful than usual at this time, but every power has its limits. Even if you are stating your case as well as anyone possibly could, someone significant still may not want to hear you out, thanks to their own shame about a touchy issue. Focus on the people you can influence, even though they might not be able to change anything for you. Your friends may benefit from hearing your story, and you could benefit from being heard.","A know-it-all could be in your life right now, one who's certain they know exactly what you should be doing with your money. Acknowledging (at least to yourself) that this person is out of line might be the first step to deciding how to handle them. This may be a situation where you have to pick your battles -- still, even if you choose to go along with what they want, having that decision be your choice for your reasons can give you some control.","What makes you look and feel good may be different from what you think is healthy. This conflict between your lived experience of pleasure and rigid ideas of wellness might be especially difficult for you to deal with if you've made those ideals part of your identity. Claiming the authority of knowing your own body might feel less secure than hiding behind the pronouncements of your favorite health guru, but this may ultimately be necessary for your pursuit to succeed.","No matter how many fun opportunities you have today, be honest about whether or not you want to pursue them. Rest and downtime may be more genuinely appealing to you, and you might be better off pursuing those than forcing yourself to socialize when your heart isn't really in it. While you may have to make an appearance at an event to honor your obligations to an important relationship, let yourself do what you need to do and then leave early.","Though you may find connecting with others appealing today, your domestic obligations could interfere with your social calendar. If there is no other way for you to hang out, you might see if your friends are able to help with whatever project is keeping you stuck at home. Letting them into this simultaneously practical and intimate part of your life could strengthen your relationship with them. Having helpers might also get your work done sooner, allowing you to get out and have fun!","Progress is the natural consequence of putting in your time on routine work, but you may have suddenly reached a point where your movement toward your bigger life goals is no longer possible to ignore. In the moment, this could trigger some discomfort if you feel like you have outgrown your longtime peers. While you could feel isolated if they don't understand all the details of what exactly you have achieved, they might still be happier for you than you realize.","You may be interested in planning a trip or taking a class to broaden your perspective, but money worries could hold you back. While it is important to acknowledge that your resources are not infinite, you might be more capable than you think of finding a compromise between responsibility and exploration. Take another look at the resources available to you at home, and you may discover that you do have a secure enough foundation for you to branch out a little bit.","While an opportunity to combine resources with someone else could be beneficial to you, you might feel drawn to the security of self-reliance and separateness instead. You have worked hard to articulate who you are, so you probably aren't eager to give that up. If you share your concerns with whoever made you the offer, they may be able to adjust some of the details to give you more space. Remember that they can't fix the problem if you don't tell them about it.","Connecting with others can be exciting and invigorating, but you could be limited by your own body's need for rest. If you know you can't keep up with all of the social opportunities that appeal to you, try to focus on those that are most likely to have lasting importance. Your reflective mood could be ideal for getting the most out of a deep conversation, as well as letting the other person feel heard, so make focused connections like that a high priority."
2021-07-31,"Today's mood could be tense, as indicated by a powerful configuration happening between five planets called a T-square. While stern Saturn in Aquarius has an idea of how things ought to be, reality may differ, as shown by the presence of the individualistic Sun and communicative Mercury in Leo. The emotional Moon and impulsive Uranus are positioned right between those two extremes, which might force a confrontation. As the Moon peacefully trines sensual Venus at3:41 pm EDT, we should look for what feels good to find our way out.","An organization you belong to may have a task in mind for you today, but your heart might not be in it. If you can't decide what to do, looking at who needs money and why could help clarify things. You can be an excellent fundraiser on your organization's behalf if you see a need there. Still, while charity is important, don't forget to secure your own finances before trying to raise money for other causes. Your collaborators should understand your priorities.","The combined burden of activity at home and pressure at work may provoke the realization that you don't want to deal with any of it right now. Try looking at the demands on your time more critically to see whether they're really that urgent. It may turn out that you have enough space to take a break and do something you truly enjoy! When you return to your duties afterwards, you'll be able to tackle even the most difficult tasks with a refreshed mind.","Talking to other people about your view on life can help you refine its details today. While your overall outlook might adequately contain most of the experiences you have had over time, you may be surprised by some realization or memory you didn't expect. Luckily, not all surprises are bad, and you could wind up discovering there is more security and protection to be found in the world than you thought. Revising your ideas to accommodate that might feel good!","You may be doing well financially, but the downside could be that now someone else wants a cut. If you get a request that you aren't sure about, don't be afraid to ask a more informed person in your network for advice. Whether or not the original provocation turns out to be better or worse than it sounds, opening a line of conversation with someone you trust about money matters might alert you to something else that is important for you to know.","A close relationship could be frustrating for you now, as it seems like you can't do anything right. Oddly enough, those you interact with in your career might have a totally different view of you at the moment, as somehow you're able to assert yourself there successfully. Sorting out whose take on you is objectively correct might not be worth the trouble, but at least you may be able to convert the positive attention you're currently getting at work into a financial advantage.","Any secret frustrations that have been brewing about the weight of your responsibilities may finally burst out in a spur-of-the-moment decision to chuck them all and go on a spontaneous adventure. While you might be tempted to find someone else to blame for your departure from duty, you can enjoy yourself more by accepting that it's normal to need a day off now and then. Venus is blessing your sign and you are ready to feel good, so just embrace the day's pleasure.","Friends may be trying to chat you up, but you might not be that into the idea. While that's perfectly fine, you'll probably be better off honestly telling them about your need to rest instead of letting them worry they did something to offend you. Once you commit to taking some alone time, you could reach surprising insights about heavy topics that have been weighing on you. As a Libra, you know the importance of connecting with others, but this is a time to strengthen your relationship with yourself.","The foundational parts of your life might all seem to be blowing up at once: home, work, and close relationships! You could feel tossed around, unable to find where you stand as major players pull you in different directions. Connecting with your broader social network may offer you some peace by being removed from the immediate drama. If you feel like opening up, these people who aren't already in so deep might also be able to give you helpful perspective on your problems.","Learning could be exciting for you now, but you might not be ready yet to talk to people about the information you're taking in. You may feel like you're disappointing others who want immediate answers, but it might be easier for you to practice a new skill physically rather than to verbally explain what you are doing, even to yourself. Trust the growing intelligence of your body! The words will come when you are ready for them, not any sooner.","Someone may be encouraging you to take a risk with shared money or property, but you might feel more cautious -- especially as the opportunity could seem to come out of nowhere. You don't have to make a decision immediately, even if you feel pressured, but you might benefit from reading up on whatever the other person is proposing. You can always say no, but researching it first will allow you to make an informed decision. Plus, you can learn something new along the way!","You may feel misunderstood in your close relationships, and the problem could involve trying to stuff yourself into a cookie-cutter style of relating that is not a good fit for you. Venturing outside the norm may be hard, but you might repeatedly run up against a metaphorical wall until you're able to articulate what you actually need out of intimacy or your domestic life. Even if not everyone can meet your needs, figuring this out will better prepare you to find those who can.","Surprising conversations can strengthen or build relationships for you today. While you may have planned to make some progress on your to-do list, frustrating obstacles could pop up in your way. Try to avoid getting attached to a particular outcome and instead accept the day's events as they come -- particularly if they aren't what you expected. You could have some interactions that are just what you need, even though you might not know that in advance."
2021-08-01,"Levity and joy are on the menu as the warming Sun and light-hearted Mercury meet in the vibrant sign of Leo at 10:08 am EDT. Serious Saturn is opposing all this, however, asking us not to get too caught up in fleeting thoughts, feelings, and connections that show up, but to truly see how we can use today’s energy to create lasting impact. The Moon in Taurus is also making a beautiful trine to powerful Pluto, bringing some comforting stability to the deep transformations many of us have undergone.","Rise and shine, Aries! Abundance is blessing you now in the forms of love, creativity, and play. Welcome the new month by embracing the inspiration that hits you, and open yourself to the wonderful connections that are coming your way. Although you may be pulled in a direction that surprises or disappoints others, stay true to yourself and respectfully prioritize what makes you feel good. Deep down, you know what's best for you -- let your intuition lead you.","You may feel a little more sensitive today as the Moon travels through your sign. You can take advantage of this receptive energy by grounding yourself and connecting with people who feel like family. Although you are probably looking forward to some peace and rest now, the demands of the external world may run against your inner needs and desires. Take breaks as you need to and observe what you can do to create balance for yourself.","Your curiosity is piqued today, whether you’re feeling social or want to dive deeper into a particular topic that has sparked your interest. This can make for some very busy or hectic energy. Use this day to listen and study, taking note of how you can expand your views of the world and people around you. A subtle approach will get you further than a direct one -- right now your greatest power comes from your ability to observe.","Your self-esteem gets a boost today, as do the resources that are available to you. You may realize that you’ve outgrown old power dynamics, as lessons in personal power, healing, and shared resources arise. Speak up for yourself, move from a place of inner strength, and set the boundaries you need with loved ones and friends. Friendships and relationships are highlighted for you now, so you may be surprised by people’s ability to respect the new you.","You’re shining today, Leo! The Sun and Mercury are joining forces in your sign, drawing light and magnetism to you. This moment is about finding the balance between your own personal freedom and expression and that of the people you care deeply about. It's possible you will feel more sensitive to how others receive you and whether you are in the right place publicly or professionally. Stay alert, because a fresh way forward could be revealed to you now as you discover options you didn’t know you had.","Now is a wonderful time for rest and self-care, Virgo. Your private life is being supported now, and all the ways you recuperate. Unfortunately, some unavoidable chores or demands in your work life may interrupt your attempts at peace. Be mindful of potential burnout, and listen to the ways your body is asking you to slow down. Creative juices are flowing freely now, so you may find means of escape and relaxation through study, creativity, and play.","Embrace your people today, Libra. There's fresh energy and attention focused on your hopes, wishes, and friendships now. Your community may be trying to steer you in the right direction, but only you know what is best for you. Let your friends help, but trust your inner compass when it comes to your passions, dreams, and love. Although you may still feel a yearning for something closer or deeper, you have an opportunity to forge new ways of nurturing yourself now.","You may find yourself in the spotlight today as opportunities and breakthroughs occur in your public image or your professional world. However, you could feel a bit torn between your private and public lives and be forced to confront some long-standing obstacles. What compromises are you willing to make? Meanwhile, emotions may surge between you and someone you're close with, for better or for worse. Trust the power of your truth to help you navigate whatever comes up.","You’re in your element today as expansion, higher learning, and travel are all highlighted. You may want to escape and explore, but feel held back as you are inundated with more tasks and responsibilities than you’d care to take on. On a positive note, there's a supportive link between your work and finances now, giving you a great opportunity to break through your errands and to-do lists. Adventure will still be calling when your chores are complete.","It’s time to own your creativity. For some time now, experiences in your life may have been revealing how you wield power, showing your capacity for transformation, and establishing you as a leader in your own right. Now, it's time to soften your approaches and channel these lessons into your creative life. What gifts are you meant to bring to the world? These revelations may call on you to get real about the resources you have and the support you’ll need to bring these goals to fruition.","The most important relationships in your life can be full of warmth, conversation, and opportunities for growth now. It's possible that certain events from the last year have led you to be harder on yourself than you need to be. Open up to the love that is around you right now, and realize that you deserve it. Your commitment to establishing routines and secure foundations can also bring a great deal of ease and healing to you.","Although you may have been living a more quiet, private lifestyle lately, your health and physical vitality are getting a big boost now, encouraging you to make some moves. Get outside, get organized, and see if there are ways to create that balance between your work and your need for rest and reflection. Although you may feel extra sensitive to the things that are happening around you today, and it’s a beautiful time to reconnect with those you trust."
2021-08-02,"Emotions may reach a boiling point and push us to our edge as the sensitive Moon forms a difficult square with expansive Jupiter today, right before it squares aggressive Mars. If disappointments, surprises, or other shakeups arise, we must take care not to dig in our heels too firmly, as new perspectives may reveal themselves soon. All of this is happening while responsible Saturn opposes the willful Sun, again asking us to pause before forcing things along.","There's a shake-up happening to your sense of stability and how you communicate your boundaries. Although you may have enjoyed expanded friendships and community lately, you could run into some hiccups now. Take care not to let distractions get in the way of your daily routines and need for personal care. If messages and obligations pop up that seem disruptive, discern whether they are worth your attention. If so, explore ways that you can integrate them into your days rather than throw you off.","You could be a bit tender today, Taurus. While your professional life may have been growing with opportunities or added responsibilities lately, today you are reminded to be true to yourself and your needs first, rather than any external feedback you are taking in. This is a wonderful chance to integrate the growth you’ve experienced this year. If there are projects or people that you are drawn to, ensure that you are being seen for who you are and compensated for what you are worth.","Old sensitivities that you thought you left behind could come back to you today. There may be some drama within your home or family life, however, what you’re feeling inside may be due to your own thoughts and fears rather than these real-life obstacles. Tune into your feelings to see which of them are warranted and which are simply echoing old and expired wounds. You may have more power to navigate this than you think.","It’s quite alright to lean on your friends and loved ones, but today you may see the limits of even your strongest support networks. If difficult emotions arise, trust that you can do the work alone when you need to. Check in with yourself about whether your feelings are reflective of your current reality, or if they’re triggering old dramas that you’ve outgrown. Healing can happen when you choose to reflect on your feelings rather than be overcome by them.","There could be some tension today between your life purpose and the people you share your life with. While you may feel confusion or instability regarding your long-term plans and goals, you’ll also have to get real about who is meant to be a part of those plans. Those around you may have some honest feedback and constructive criticism. Take communications with a grain of salt, but note what is shared with you and how you can further grow.","You could find yourself drawn to spiritual pursuits and your long-term dreams today, but you could also realize how they are in conflict with your daily responsibilities. Although you are gifted with a boost of ambition and more action in your life right now, you might need to take care of some haziness around your desires. Now is the time to get organized around your personal goals, values, and power, and make the subtle shifts that will help you to implement your long-term plans.","The events of the day may require you to dig deep, Libra. There's a lot of emotion now surrounding topics of healing and transformation, your relationship to intimacy, and your greater perspectives on life. The question of the moment is, what needs to be healed so that you can fully embrace the love around you and the creativity within you? Ask yourself what you have to lose by letting go of your fears. No matter what, you have something to gain.","There’s a reality check taking place between your home life and your career. A limiting energy is at play that may leave you having to choose between these two areas. At the same time, you could feel heightened tension between you and those you share your life and dreams with. While today may feel like a rollercoaster, you’re being asked to get firm about what is most important to you. Once you re-establish those boundaries, allow whatever doesn’t fit to fall away.","The work that you’ll have to put in in order to reach your dreams could become more apparent today. You may feel like you’re caught in the minutia of tasks, to-dos, and errands that leave you without time to reach for more. Take a moment to remember how each of these little things contributes to the greater whole. As much as you’re driven to make moves today, check in on the relationships that have supported you and will continue to do so regardless of your achievements.","You can’t always go it alone. You are the workhorse of the zodiac and your determination is unmatched. Still, as the opportunities and resources around you transform, be mindful of the collaborations that you’ll want to bring in to keep your momentum going. Although you should be discerning about who has access to your heart and your trust, you should also be willing to open yourself up to greater possibilities for finding like-minded people and work that speaks to you.","Sometimes we need a reminder of just how far we've come. Subtle hints of your past may creep up today, but while these emotions may feel challenging, they could be here to ask if you're ready to move on. You are in a phase of immense growth and maturation, and today you could discover exactly what it is that you’re growing away from. Take stock of how much progress you have made over the past year and give yourself a pat on the back.","You have been immersed in a long process of retreat and letting go, which may have sparked feelings of confusion or weariness over the past year. Today, this all comes to a head. People’s words and actions may disappoint you, but take this moment to reflect on your expectations. Are you asking too much of others? Could you be more clear about what you want and need from the people around you? There may be work to do on both ends of your relationships."
2021-08-03,"Today will be a mixed bag, bringing a wonderful balance between stability and excitement for everyone. Venus in analytical and thoughtful Virgo will make a trine to progressive Uranus at 2:53 am EDT, helping us to see new possibilities and creative solutions to any breakthroughs or breakdowns we may be experiencing. Although Mercury and Uranus will clash later this evening, the Moon will work to smooth out our emotional responses to any disruptions that arise. The day's energies may not provide clarity, but they will open up new ways of navigating obstacles.","Your finances could receive an exciting boost today, but be wary of making agreements before checking in with yourself and others about any expectations. With the current planetary configuration, you could end up making unwanted sacrifices that you didn't see coming. If things do go awry or sound too good to be true, it’s an excellent day to call on friends for advice. Their words could not only have a lasting impression, but they could also be just what you need to hear.","The cosmos is flavoring your day with a special kind of sweetness -- but that doesn't mean it won't come with challenges. While some may be drawn to your quirky yet earthy nature and any new means of self-expression, not everyone will be as accepting. Tensions around your home and family may arise, but don’t let frustrating news or miscommunications get you down or damage your sense of self-worth. Know that regardless of what comes up for you, you are being supported as you find your personal footing.","Your own inner wisdom could be revealed to you today -- and to those around you. In fact, others may be drawn to you for advice and a listening ear. Pay attention to what they disclose and notice what you can offer based on the lessons you have already learned. Your empathy and vulnerability are your superpowers right now but be mindful of what you share. These intimate spaces may lead you to let them in on information that is better kept between you and those you deeply trust.","The universe is urging you to have fun and deepen your bonds today. If you've felt detached from these areas of your life, this is the time to reconnect with and explore the people you enjoy and the things that make you happy. While adventures and new projects may be on the table, be careful of overspending and overcommitting yourself. You’ll benefit from setting a budget and seeing what you can do within it. Your friends will understand ... and probably thank you in the long run.","If you're going into the day not feeling great, the cosmos is going to try and change that. A positive alignment of the planets could bring a surge of abundance to your career or financial status now. Try to appreciate what is unfolding for you without getting too carried away with your excitement. You’ll attract more help, respect, and accolades through gratitude than gregariousness. Then, once you've reaped your rewards, you can find a way to celebrate with your loved ones.","You’ve been moving through a series of expansion, study, and long-term planning for some time now, and the day's energies are rewarding you for coming such a long way. This doesn't mean there isn't still work to do -- there will still be still growth and challenges along the way. However, you could receive pats on the back today from those who've noticed your commitment to the process. Allow yourself to take it all in as you deserve the praise.","The part of your chart that rules all things hidden was recently activated, and as a result, you may now have a desire to keep things a little more low-key. However, tough communications could come from a friend or two today -- but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Friction doesn't mean frenzy; in fact, this could be a chance to create more intimate connections through your discourse. Lean into these conversations, as the sense of support you'll feel could bring you the peace you've been seeking.","Lean into what is working today because the good is going to outweigh the bad. Your friendships and connections could see an infusion of love and excitement, pushing you to get out and have some fun. Hiccups may arise by the end of the day if you get a little too carried away but be honest and accountable with those around you and ask them to do the same. In fact, any conversations you have now could end up being more constructive than you expect.","Embrace the love that will surround you today. The universe is casting a soft glow over your connections, allowing you to bond with loved ones through intentional conversations where you talk about your dreams and goals together. You're often seen as more bold and adventurous than emotional or wistful. Let people see another side of you now by sharing your greatest aspirations with them. Any conversations you have could help you get clear on how you can move toward them.","There's a possibility that a wish you've had for a while will be granted. You could be introduced to people who want to help bring your goals to life, while also pushing you to check in with whether those goals leave space for your innovation and self-expression. You are a sign driven by practicality, but it can't be all business all the time. Today you're being given a cosmic push to loosen your grip and ensure that your work reflects your soul’s needs for play and creativity.","Rays of light will drop into your lap today, giving you a chance to take a breath and enjoy yourself. Take time to explore something new just for the sake of it, and don't let any shake-ups derail your flow. Simply take whatever is thrown your way in stride and give yourself a chance to step back to gather your thoughts on the best way to move forward. Trust that you’re more than capable of getting through it.","Relish in the spaces and relationships that feel like home to you today. Your schedule or the demands of work may get hectic, so do your best to take breaks when you can and let the stress go once you are done. Make time for a quiet moment with just a few of your favorite people, as these warm connections and helpful words can work wonders to balance out any volatile feelings you're experiencing. Trust that you have everything and everyone that you need right now."
2021-08-04,"Intuition clashes with desire, but ultimately we get what is meant for us. The emotional Moon is square idealistic Neptune, creating illusions that drive us to chase our whims, despite that nagging feeling that there’s something more fulfilling out there. Thankfully, the Moon connects in a harmonious trine with wise Jupiter, aligning us with what’s best for us, rather than what’s flashy and tempting. Finally, the Moon enters its home sign of Cancer at 5:17 pm EDT, making everything a little clearer, both in our hearts and our heads.","You might be tempted to doubt yourself, all because of words carelessly said. Instead of allowing an offhand criticism to throw you off your game, remind yourself that at the end of the day, it’s you who has to live with your choices. Life shouldn’t be about listening to a panel of people telling you what to do. A friend who really knows you, or even a social media post that strikes a chord with you, can help give you the courage to be yourself.","Mishaps with your belongings can cause issues, but they can also be quickly resolved as long as you have faith in yourself. Whether you misplace your keys or a friend absentmindedly forgets to return something of yours, you’re likely to do a bit of hunting for your possessions. The way the day goes is largely dependent on your ability to handle confusing situations with confidence and calm, because stressing yourself out will be the biggest battle you face. Keep cool -- a little detective work will go a long way.","Psyching yourself out can cause you to feel bad for no reason. Your own image is one of the hardest things to see clearly, but seeing yourself in a better light will help you seize the day. Just finding the confidence in yourself is usually the hardest part -- even if you don’t necessarily feel it fully, encouraging yourself in the mirror instead of self-criticizing can help you create more positive outcomes. Don’t let negative self-talk stand between you and what you know is for you.","It’s a confusing day, and you may not know which way to go. Instead of feeling like you need to make a decision quickly, allow yourself to let it marinate in your mind before you decide what you will do. It’s not a time for quick and direct action -- this is one of those tricky times where you may really not be sure what you want. It will be easier to hear your inner voice later in the day, so give yourself the time you need to hear it.","A friend may offer what they think is friendly advice, but unfortunately, it’s not likely to have the effect that they want on you. You may take this as an affront or as unwanted criticism, but remember that you don’t have to obey each and every piece of advice handed to you, nor is your interpretation of the advice always accurate. Try to let it slide right off you instead of playing it over in your mind -- it’s not worth losing sleep over!","Work mishaps and confusing interactions with authority figures may be in store. Try to keep things light in the workplace, because any confrontations or significant power plays are likely to backfire. Hindsight is 20/20, and later in the day, you’ll likely realize the flaws that might have been in your plans. You can treat the day like an imaginary practice run, making mental notes about what to do and not to do, and put your plan into action later.","You may run into issues with school or travel, which can make you want to give up and end the day before it’s even started. Instead of running away at the first sign of these issues, be patient. Try to stay the course and work things out. Odds are, a little random luck is likely to come in the form of a surprise gift, or a small influx of cash could help to offset the disarray from the earlier part of the day.","Misunderstandings or miscommunications can cause you to worry unnecessarily. Drama may crop up between yourself and people that you depend on if you act too quickly on messages or conversations that you don’t understand, so avoid jumping to conclusions if you can help it. A family member or a roommate may be able to help you figure out the best course of action. Acting from a place of compassion and kindness will help the day to work out in your favor.","Relationships can be uncertain now, keeping you in the dark about someone you may be interested in. There might be someone you want to get to know better -- in a friendly, romantic, or professional sense -- but their actions or something that you hear from someone else about them can turn you off. Odds are, you don’t know the whole story, and finding out what really happened can help to prevent an argument or a missed opportunity. Do your best to avoid assuming.","You might feel drained of energy right now, making it especially important to take time for self-care. Even if you feel the need to push yourself, make sure that you’re not pushing so hard that you make things more difficult for yourself later. Before you run yourself into the ground, stop to determine if what you're doing absolutely needs to be done immediately, or if it can wait until tomorrow. If you're looking for some support, someone special in your life could help you get back on your feet.","Fun without any preparation could land you in hot water. You may get carried away with the temptations surrounding you, and find out too late that you exceeded your budget or procrastinated too much on your responsibilities. You probably don’t need to spend a ton of money to have fun today -- you can likely have fun hanging out and talking or playing a game with friends. Either way, check your bank account before you buy a round of drinks for everyone!","The bad mood of people close to you can put a damper on your day, but chances are they’re upset about something else and taking out their feelings on you. While you may need to take responsibility if you know you have something to apologize for, you don’t have to take on their feelings as your own and let it ruin the entirety of your day. It’ll be easier to talk it out later on; just realize that not every feeling they have is about you."
2021-08-05,"It can be easier for us to make changes in our lives today, and we don’t have to look far to see what needs improvement. The nurturing Moon is forming a supportive sextile with productive Mars in Virgo, creating an emotional drive to fix up our surroundings and heal old grudges. Once the Moon sextiles Uranus in lasting Taurus at 10:12 pm EDT, the atmosphere shifts to make it easier to adjust to the changes we’ve made, so that we can stick to what we’ve newly created for ourselves.","Self-esteem is raised a little higher today, and discipline made a little stronger. You may have started a new routine that's been positive for you, and you could begin seeing results that have kept themselves hidden up to now. These new results can help to boost your confidence and, in turn, make you more devoted to these positive new lifestyle habits. If these new habits have just been an idea in the back of your head so far, a nostalgic memory or experience might make it easier to start today.","Rebellious interests may help you break out of your comfort zone. Even if you can't explain them, intriguing and exciting new desires might be playing in your mind. This could be as simple as a new hairstyle or as powerful as a skydiving trip. If your head is saying ""that's not me,"" but you still feel pulled toward this unknown territory, go ahead and try it out. Remember, you're an ever-evolving person, you're not frozen in time. Life is short, so go ahead and follow that path less taken!","Old wounds or grudges are melting away, but you may not know how to let them go. You might realize that someone who hurt you is out of your life now and you're thinking of them less, but you still want closure without needing to get it from them. Throwing out items that remind you of this person or writing a letter that you then burn or tear up can help you move on. Even if this is a past version of yourself, it's time to leave it behind.","Some of your friendships may be changing, and it's okay to mourn the old versions if you need to. Someone may have just had a baby and can't hang out as much, or they may have simply changed interests and don't want to spend time in the same places that they used to. While it's natural to want to do the same things you always have, don't try to force them to be who they aren't anymore. Try to grow with them and find new ways to have fun together.","Beneficial changes in the workplace can arrive now, but they may take a little more effort on your part. It's likely that you'll have the energy to adapt, yet there could be a learning curve that you have to adjust to. Instead of getting frustrated with yourself or your coworkers if you don't get it right away, try it out a couple more times and see if you don't like this new way even better. Odds are, you can use this new method to your advantage.","Learning a new skill isn't always easy, but you're likely to be a fast learner today. For you, the universe's energy is a little more open-ended right now -- you're able to direct your sharper mind toward what interests you as a hobby, or you can set your sights on furthering a skill that will make you more desirable in the job market. Travel is also supported for you, just make sure to avoid getting in a rush, because recklessness can make the journey take longer.","Order may finally take over some chaos in your financial life, and a beneficial business partnership could help make this happen. You might have to take a chance on someone that you're not sure about, but this is likely going to turn out well for you in the end. You're able to make more rational decisions today, and making the right choices even when they're somewhat unclear is easier. Trust in your intuition when you have that eureka moment -- it can serve you well.","A partner or a close friend may present you with new options today that surprise you, but they're likely to excite you as well. If someone suggests you try that new place you haven't had a chance to visit or a movie that you hadn't heard of, take a chance and let them take the reins. You don't always need to have a say in the way the day goes -- sometimes it's easier and more fun to sit back and let someone else lead the charge.","You may have a somewhat isolated day, but the alone time can do you good. There are responsibilities or hobbies that you may have let slide while you were caught up with other people's lives, and while you may be someone who enjoys being a social butterfly, sometimes it's fun to remember the things you enjoy doing when it's just you. If you find that everyone's busy, go ahead and pick up that old project or see where you left off in that book you were reading.","Having fun and being a little more chatty can be the keys to your success today. This might be a very social day where you find yourself flitting back and forth between various friend groups in order to do everything on your agenda. This can be good for you now, and your networking skills will likely come into play and could lead you into a new group that fits you well. These people may even become a permanent fixture in your lifestyle.","Changes in your environment may inspire you in ways you weren't expecting. Maybe something as simple as a new lamp is brightening up the room and improving your mood, or perhaps a roommate moved out and now you're tasked with deciding how to decorate this free space in your home. Use this time to improve your living space while you have extra ambition and energy supporting you. There's no time like the present, and it's a great opportunity to get a lot done without needing as much effort.","You may be tempted to speak your mind today, so use it to say something constructive. Although the power of your words is stronger now, you are still able to decide whether to use your words to lift others up or to bring them down. The more positivity and encouragement you're able to spread, the more you'll receive in return. Don't underestimate how many are listening to you, and don't feel that no one cares what you have to say. You never know who's taking your words to heart."
2021-08-06,"Our elaborate plans to shoot for the stars may end up sending us back to the drawing board today. The emotional Moon’s trine to imaginative Neptune creates high ideals that may be difficult to achieve, and the Moon opposing chaotic Pluto can quickly bring us back down to earth. When the confident Sun squares changeable Uranus at 7:57 pm EDT, they’ll show us that even the most airtight plans are subject to the will of the universe, so be flexible and roll with the punches!","There isn’t a lot of energy available from the universe at the moment, but your responsibilities are still there waiting for you, whether you're feeling up to them or not. While your tasks may be tough ones, it's best to grin and bear them, because trying to hide from your responsibilities is only a temporary solution. It'll be less stressful in the end to tackle your to-do list immediately. That way, you'll be able to rest without your worries weighing you down.","Chaos may be coming from within rather than without! Waffling between two options could create more difficulty than either would be worth. Your friends can make an event or activity sound good, but once the time comes to participate, you may realize it's not really what you want to do. Do yourself a favor and think twice before committing to anything taking place today, and let your friends know that you’ll think about it instead of jumping straight into a yes.","Your energy is ebbing and flowing, and you may experience a rather jarring rise and fall to it throughout the day. You could overestimate how much time or energy you have, and the things that you commit to easily in the morning might feel exhausting later on. Try to work at a moderate pace and balance your schedule thoughtfully. Perhaps think twice before offering up your assistance to do the work of multiple people. After all, you're only one person -- treat yourself accordingly.","Those around you may end up throwing a wrench in your best-laid plans, so be prepared to go to plan B if you must depend on others. This doesn't mean that they're purposefully sabotaging you, but there is a high likelihood that something may prevent them from keeping their word or fulfilling any obligations to you. It's not a good time for group projects or presentations, but if you need to be a part of one, make sure to iron out all the details carefully.","Your routine may hit a snag that takes up much of your day, so give yourself a little wiggle room. Instead of planning your day down to the minute, it's best to schedule yourself a little extra time or a few more hours to sleep. Your estimation of how long your tasks will take is likely erring on the short side, and you could end up draining your energy and creating stress for yourself if you jam-packed your agenda. Rest is necessary, not optional!","Leisure can cause the day to escape you, which is fine if you plan to devote the day to self-care or getting together with friends. Time flies when you're having fun! Still, keep track of time if you have other responsibilities to attend to. You may even be anticipating a time-limited event that, with today’s fast pace, might pass you by if you're not paying attention. Others likely won't help you keep track of the details, so keep an eye on the clock!","Worry and suspicion cast shadows over today’s energy. Someone in your community or a coworker may have planted these worries in your head for you, either out of a genuine desire to protect you from what could go wrong or in an attempt to throw you off your game. Try not to assume the worst! Often, if you take the time to sit and follow these worries to their logical conclusions, you'll realize that the worst-case scenario is far less likely than more favorable outcomes.","A friend or partner may act out of character today. It can be hard to anticipate or understand the moods of others currently, but it's not your job to read their mind. While you can try to decipher their attitude, they are able to speak up if they need to. Don't lose sleep over trying to figure out what they want -- if they aren’t willing to say what’s bothering them, it’s okay to just concentrate on your own path.","Your self-esteem may be low at the moment, so be kind to yourself and others. Focusing on the gloomy side of every story can lead you to negative self-talk and unnecessary criticism. Try to push yourself to be thankful, even if it feels like you're being insincere with yourself. There are two sides to every situation! While being pessimistic can feel like you're protecting yourself from getting your hopes up, it can also prevent you from feeling joy and excitement.","Many people in your circle could seem like they’re struggling, and you may want to help them out by giving advice. Even if you're right, it would be best to keep that extra bit of constructive criticism to yourself right now -- your helpful advice is more likely to be taken as scolding rather than friendly conversation. Instead of making suggestions on how they can fix things, ask what you can do to make their load a little lighter.","Your health or energy may be low right now, requiring you to rest your body more than you’d like. You might feel tempted to push through the lack of energy in order to keep juggling all the various activities in your life, but don't overwork yourself to the point of burning out. This could be how you got to this state of low energy in the first place! If your schedule isn't sustainable, you may want to revise the way you care for yourself.","Today may feel insurmountable when you try to tackle your tasks alone, and the people who are normally there for you could seem like they're nowhere to be found. You might find yourself depending on someone unexpected now, but some help is better than none. Instead of trying to tough it out solo, accept the assistance of that acquaintance who asks if you're doing okay. Sometimes receiving someone’s help gratefully is just as nice for the helper as it is for the helped!"
2021-08-07,"Ego without hard work to back it up is bound to result in some unfavorable outcomes today. The emotional Moon enters proud Leo at 3:31 am EDT, encouraging us to be more confident and self-assured -- but that can also lead to bossiness or bragging. Once the Moon opposes disciplinary Saturn, if boasts aren't bolstered by blood, sweat, and tears, they're likely to fall flat. However, those who can back up their words with actions can grow stronger after they accept the day’s challenge.","Success today relies on saying less and listening more. You might be speaking out of turn in front of a real expert, so make sure that you know what you're talking about before you throw out wild claims. There's also a chance that you're the expert compared to someone who’s louder than they are smart in this situation. In this case, give them an opportunity to listen to you. If they refuse, you can allow them to embarrass themselves. After all, you tried!","Family disputes are likely now, with fathers thinking they know best and mothers insisting the opposite, or elders and youths getting caught in stubborn arguments. If you find yourself in a clash of mindsets, realize that you're not likely to change anyone's mind through yelling or throwing out ultimatums. Quiet and calm discussions are what will help you to make your point. Even if it isn’t absorbed right away, later on your wisdom and common sense could begin to sink in.","The reality of a situation might not line up with your morals today, and you may fight to try to create the situation that you wanted initially. While it's admirable to defend your principles and seek justice, ask yourself if you're presenting an idealistic vision or an achievable goal. Sometimes you have to allow space for compromises in order to keep the peace, and that means not letting your personal views get in the way of the well-being of the people around you.","Your heart may be tempted into temporary pleasures, while your head is trying to keep you on a more responsible path. There's nothing wrong with giving in to temptation every now and again, but this specific impulse might trip you up in the long run if you give into it now. Straying from the straight and narrow is unlikely to work out in your favor, so you'll want to make sensible choices in order to end the day in a good place.","Misunderstandings can happen right now between you and the other people in your life. You're more sensitive to the comments of others, but relationships will likely not become dramatic if you're able to keep things light -- serious activities together may be better left for tomorrow. The more you can laugh at yourself, the easier any questionable comments will slide off your back. Respecting yourself and knowing who you are keeps you from getting wrapped up in anyone else's opinions.","It can feel selfish to put your own well-being first, but you won’t be able to be there for others if you drain yourself dry. Someone may act demandingly towards you, and although it may be difficult, you should try to set boundaries if you really need the rest. Balancing your priorities between your health and your peace of mind will create a better atmosphere overall. Be willing to take care of yourself by treating yourself like you would treat a friend.","You may need to be there for someone who needs you today, which could get in the way of something fun for you. You're no stranger to compromise, even if it’s hard to let go of your initial plans. Trust that you likely won't regret being there for someone who's looking for a friend to lean on. Knowing that you helped them in their time of need, especially if they were there for you in the past, can be incredibly rewarding.","Listening to others and simply being there for them can help you find success. You may feel the need to take charge at the moment and possibly muscle down your emotions to be strong for others, but this isn't necessarily the best way to go. Someone who opens up to you is likely looking for empathy rather than solutions. If they need to cry, let them cry -- you may even want to cry with them. An emotional release will be good for everyone involved!","Give-and-take is required now, and inequality in that regard can cause discord. If you find that you're carrying all the weight in a relationship or that you're putting too much on the other person, then it may be time to rebalance the way you interact. This is true for all relationships -- romantic, platonic, or familial. There's nothing wrong with carrying someone for a time. After all, we all need help sometimes. Just keep in mind that a one-sided relationship will eventually fall over.","Trust is of the utmost importance for you now. If you feel that someone you're spending time with today is jealous of you or constantly bringing you down through biting remarks disguised as jokes, you may feel a painful, emotional pang from this treatment. Ask yourself if they’re like this all the time. Pulling back from this person completely doesn't need to happen right away, but if you're feeling more hurt by them than empowered, it may be time to begin your retreat.","While the people around you may be struggling with the opinions of others right now, you’re likely the one cutting yourself down. If you're able to be kind to yourself (even if you make a mistake), you will have won half the battle today. Odds are, an embarrassing moment is arriving soon that you’ll have to overcome mentally. Be patient with yourself while you come up with an internal pep talk -- don't be your own worst enemy!","Your enemies might have more of a hold on you than you realize, even the ones who are just annoying coworkers or inconvenient acquaintances. You could find that the things these people say bother you more than they normally do, inciting you to find ways to impress them. Remind yourself that there's no need to change if your actions aren't harmful to others, and that you can't please everyone. Your time would be better spent on things other than wooing people you don't even want"
2021-08-08,"Choosing to set our egos aside helps us make room for stronger emotional cores. Inner change can be difficult, especially as the emotional Moon approaches the end of its current lunar cycle and squares rebellious Uranus. Our inner selves are called to evolve, but it may soon become clear that this change made us stronger. The New Moon in confident Leo at 9:50 am EST invites us to look to our future as leaders, and we are ready to take on whatever life throws our way.","Growing up is a theme for you during this time, and the responsible thing to do may clash with your first instinct. You'll likely be asked to compromise with someone, and it may require a minor sacrifice, either of your time or money, but rest assured that it is the kind course of action. Instead of feeling like you're missing out, if you consider it as planting seeds of goodwill that will grow for you over the next month, then what was once a sacrifice becomes a gift to your future self.","Traditional values may get in the way of your rebellious self-expression. While the nature of this rebellion can be big or small, the person you are now may be deviating from the path that your family set for you, and you're not sure if you want the comfort of doing what's always been done or the freedom of striking out on your own. Try and rebel against the norm just a little bit, rather than jumping in feet first -- taking small steps makes it easier to find yourself.","Any worries or fears that suddenly crop up out of nowhere must be quieted so that you can live your life. You may notice an odd anxiety that you don't normally feel surrounding a speaking opportunity, or you could be nervous about a trip to somewhere you haven't been yet. Instead of backing down right away, try to power through the nerves -- see if you don't feel more confident after conquering your fears and finding the courage to do what you wanted to do.","Someone may question you today, but you don't have to let this evolve into a disagreement. Your methods will never be exactly the same as someone else's, and while this person may submit their opinion about how you should be living or working, you can take it with a grain of salt. Try not to take what they're saying as a personal attack, because although this comment may shake your confidence, it is merely a suggestion to be taken or left behind.","Work and other responsibilities can be a challenge, but the more flexible you are, the easier it will be to handle. You may have your specific ways you like to do things, however, these methods might not be achievable under today's influences. Events that are out of the ordinary are likely to transpire, and you'll have to think on the fly to figure out how to manage the challenges being thrown your way. You can be strong and willing to try something new at the same time.","You could be caught between conflicting feelings at the moment, unsure whether to stay or go. This is understandable, so don't feel like you have to make a decision right away. While it may seem like something urgent, you might not have all the information yet, and it would be beneficial to hold off until you know the full story. You may be getting a chance to start over, but if you're only running away, it will require more of your time to find closure.","Your loyalties may be shifting in your business relationships, or perhaps you are feeling peer pressure today to do something that doesn't quite align with who you are. Take your time making any decisions. If there's an option that you were already leaning toward, there may be something that your intuition knows that you aren't aware of yet. No matter what others are telling you to do, trust your gut, because it's steering you in the right direction.","Your outlook on success could shift today as someone older or more experienced brings you their story. You may have been defining success as fame or awards, but hearing about someone else's fortunate experience, or even misfortunate experience, can open your eyes to what you really want your life to look like at the pinnacle. You might realize you don't want to be surrounded by adoring fans, instead opting for a quiet family life or even skydiving around the world -- it's about what fulfills you!","Old wounds and thoughts of former enemies may still sting at times, but today you are being urged to let go of what's not serving you. Mentally lingering in a past moment with the people who hurt you may be preventing you from being fully present with the people that you really want to be with now. Be present, even though there may be reminders of bygone times. You'll make better decisions if firmly rooted in the current","An opportunity for you to have fun could arise today, but you may worry you'll seem silly taking advantage of it. You might make an extra attempt to seem grown up or serious, even though an exciting pastime or party is calling your name. You likely spend enough time being responsible -- although letting loose could make you feel a little vulnerable, it’s worth it to enjoy yourself. Chances are, you will look back in the future and be glad you took your chances.","You could find that people you once felt at home with are no longer providing that same comfort now. Sometimes though, you have to be the one providing that feeling of safety. If you find that someone who you’ve known to be very stable or on top of things is now beginning to need someone to lean on, it may be time for you to step up and be that person for them. We all need a port in the storm, and it feels good to give back.","Your energy may be low today and you might not feel like sharing your troubles with others. Still, your friends could surprise you. Even though it’s noble of you to not want to be a burden, sometimes it helps others to feel needed. Instead of trying to look too far into the future and plan or worry about what could happen, take your life one task at a time. Allow yourself to focus on what you’re doing now and ask for what you need in order to succeed."
2021-08-09," It’s time to express ourselves without overexplaining ourselves. The emotional Moon's conjunction with communicative Mercury in expressive Leo helps us say what we’re truly thinking and feeling, and we can be a bit dramatic about it. The Moon's opposition to expansive Jupiter can cause us to take this expression to the extreme, while perfectionist Venus opposing confusing Neptune may cause those around us to miss the point of what we want so badly to say. Say what needs to be said, and then let it go.","Exciting events are in your future, but multitasking can keep you from enjoying what’s supposed to be fun. You may try to do the work of many people at once, and this can frustrate you. Ultimately, whatever work you have left to do can wait until tomorrow, and the person who’s texting you non-stop will be okay with you taking some time for yourself. The more you’re able to streamline what you’re trying to accomplish, the easier it will be to keep from getting flustered.","Your family or people that you live with may not realize that they’re crowding you. They might not know that many of them are in contact with you at once and overloading you with information, which can cause you to experience mental burnout and accidentally emotionally overwhelm you. Gently let the people in your house know if they’re doing too much, or if they need to approach you one at a time in order to get the best response from you.","You may find it hard to keep your thoughts to yourself today; words seem to just flow out of your mouth, possibly bypassing your brain. Thinking before you speak will be key to your success, even if you have to bite your tongue in order to do so. You might feel like you’re speaking up for what you believe in, but even if you think it’s for a good cause, you could end up alienating allies without realizing it until later.","Emotional spending is easier to indulge in today than usual, and your wallet may take a hit if you aren’t ready for it. Others could coax you into spending more than you were expecting on traveling or frivolous items. While it’s okay to deviate from your budget, make sure that you actually want the opportunities that you're pursuing. It could help to stop and think of your long-term goals before you jump into short-term pleasures that you may not even care about later.","Expressing your sensitivity and wearing your heart on your sleeve may not bring the desired results today. You have a heart and you want to show it, but others might not see where you're coming from and could see you as dramatic. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to explain yourself, try to stick to the facts, because your emotions can land you in more confusion than you started in. The more clear and concise you are, the better drama can be avoided.","You may experience complex feelings that are hard to explain right now, but others might still pick up on your emotions. Even if you have an opportunity to express yourself, the words simply may not come to you. Be patient with yourself, and if you feel that you can trust the person who's encouraging you to open up, then it's okay to let them in a little. However, try to stick with one train of thought, because veering all over the place won't get your point across.","A few sides of one dramatic story may appear before you now. You might find that one friend is insisting certain events transpired in their version of the tale, while the next friend pops up with something that is hardly recognizable as the first version you heard. Ultimately, your mission is to avoid becoming too involved in an event you happened to miss, so you don't get tangled up in something you can't even confirm or deny. Let them handle it, it's for the best!","Speaking up in the workplace or another shared setting may cause people to butt heads. While it is admirable to defend your beliefs, recognize when you're just throwing fuel on a fire, rather than changing hearts and minds. It's probably wise to guide your words toward keeping everyone cool while you're stuck together where you are, especially if the conflict wasn't yours to start with. Your input could be seen as creating drama, and unless you're prepared to handle the increase in tempers, it's best to steer clear.","Your head may be in the clouds while someone is trying to get you to hear what they're really saying. If you're distracted by matters going on in other areas of your life, you won't be focused on this conversation. It's worth it to lend a listening ear, because you may miss out on a friend by being dismissive. If you really have pressing matters to attend to, make it known that you're just busy and that you'll be willing to give them space to talk another time soon.","Sharing secrets with people who can't keep them could come back to bite you. You might have some information that you weren't ready to share with everyone, but it may be too hard to keep to yourself. Just make sure that if you end up telling someone before you're ready to make this knowledge public, you trust them to care as much as you do. It's safest to keep your thoughts to yourself for now, because loose lips could create hard feelings between yourself and idle gossipers.","Chatty people could feel draining today, as you feel like you can't get a word in. Others may feel like they can dump their emotional baggage in your lap, but then when it's your turn to share, turn around and ignore you. This is an unfair exchange and you deserve better communication from the people around you. If you need to take time to rest and recharge, it's okay to mute your phone for a little while and care for yourself.","Someone who hurt you in the past may show up today and pretend like nothing is wrong. While it can be hard to set emotional boundaries, and you may have even had good times with this person in the past, it's not a good day to rehash old conflicts -- but it's not a good idea to gloss over them either. If you're still feeling hurt over an event you never got closure on, it's okay to wait to reply until you feel better able to speak your mind."
2021-08-10,"The unknown shines with fresh appeal today, while our comfort zones begin to feel a little stifling. The sensitive Moon trines offbeat Uranus, encouraging us to try new things and shake off the cobwebs that may have settled over our lives. Logical Mercury’s opposition to expansive Jupiter at 9:20 pm EDT could require us to think outside the box in order to break out of the ordinary routine we're stuck in. It’ll be exhilarating once we've conquered those first few steps!","Opportunities to break out of your current routine can bring money-making avenues to the front of your mind today. You may find that either dropping a long-standing habit or starting up a new one will bring a side hustle to your attention. This opportunity could come from someone in your community, through reading a flyer, or simply seeing a commercial that happens to cross your path. Be on the lookout for an event or a local listing that happens to pique your interest.","Something that sounds fun could come your way, but you might shun it in favor of doing what you're used to. While being responsible and sticking to the plan is okay, you may find yourself regretting not going after this activity once it fades from view. This could also be a connection with a companion that you wouldn't normally consider, even if you had fun with them when you first interacted. Step outside of your comfort zone a little, especially if an invitation keeps playing on your mind!","You may feel an undeniable urge to communicate with someone today -- either a new person or one that you haven’t spoken to in a while. It might even feel strange to suddenly want to connect with them. You can ignore this feeling if you’d like, however, not reaching out could cause you to miss out on words that you need to hear. This person may not turn into your new best friend, but your intuition is likely calling you to them for a reason.","You may feel particularly shy around new people at the moment, but someone might reach out to you anyway. They may strike up a conversation, making small talk or asking light questions in an effort to connect. While there's no need to tell them your whole life story right away, there's nothing wrong with indulging them and encouraging the friendship, even in a minor way. They may need the conversation more than you do, and you never know how helpful a kind word can be.","A job listing that actually intrigues you may appear before you, but you might feel unqualified for the position. While it could feel presumptuous to throw your hat in the ring, you may want to go for it and see if the person they're looking for is actually you! After all, someone who's genuinely interested in the job is likely to be a better candidate than a more qualified person who’d leave the moment something else came along. Let your enthusiasm lead the way.","A surprise trip to somewhere new could present itself now ... but you may not want to deviate from your original plans. New places can be intimidating, yet these out-of-the-blue excursions are often where memories are made. While you probably can't remember exactly what you were doing six months ago during your normal routine, impromptu vacations -- even just for a day -- are much more memorable. Break your routine daily cycle by inviting a little spontaneity in and enjoying the ride.","An extra influx of cash or a free opportunity to do something special could be coming your way right now. Other people might try to tell you how to spend it best, but the choice of what to do with this gift is really up to you. While it's okay to take suggestions if you really don't have any ideas, there's likely already a little voice in your heart that knows the most fun and memorable way to spend your good fortune. Follow that little voice.","You may have achieved something recently that you're proud of, but people around you might not show the interest in it that you feel it deserves. They could even discourage your happiness if your emotions clearly rely on their responses. Remember, a lion doesn't lose sleep over the opinions of sheep. Celebrating yourself in your own way with a special dinner or by taking a break from your usual chores allows you to pat yourself on the back without needing the fanfare of others.","Your routine might have just opened up, leaving you unsure how to fill that new space. This space may have been created by someone that you spend a lot of time with who is currently unavailable, or perhaps a place where you enjoy spending time has temporarily shut down. You can spend those free hours getting back into an old hobby or by calling up an old friend that you used to have fun with. Do something just for the fun of it!","Being flexible isn't always easy -- especially today. Plans with someone could be altered if they aren’t able to make it on time or if you have to meet somewhere that you weren't expecting. Despite your best efforts, the itinerary you have in mind may turn out to be unavailable. Try looking at the new situation as an adventure! Don't let the change of plans faze you; you can prove yourself to be a problem-solver rather than a wet blanket.","Someone may show up unexpectedly in your life, possibly right at your front door. While you might not like surprises, you're likely still able to roll with the punches and open your home to this person without it upsetting your routine too much. It wouldn't hurt to tidy up a little whenever you have the opportunity earlier in the day -- if you're prepared, then you won't feel flustered in case anyone arrives uninvited. It might be worth it to see where the visit goes.","You may feel drawn to someone you don't normally talk to, but being the first one to speak up can feel daunting. Remind yourself that there’s nothing wrong with reaching out to someone else, even if it feels awkward at first. It can be easy to isolate yourself without realizing what’s happening, and sometimes you have to be the one to break through the barrier between yourself and others. Today is about communication and togetherness, so push through any shyness and try to be as friendly as possible."
2021-08-11,"It's time to get organized and transform what needs improvement! While today can be chaotic, with the Moon making several aspects and taking our emotions on a ride, once intellectual Mercury enters its home sign of analytical Virgo, we'll have an opportunity to see our situation more clearly. Beautiful Venus trines transformative Pluto at 6:46 pm EDT and inspires us to stop making excuses that allow us to settle for less. If we want better for ourselves, we have to step up to the challenge.","Halfheartedly completing your tasks just won't cut it right now. Even if you've been able to manage so far by only giving a fraction of your effort to your recent work, coasting along will not take you to where you're really trying to go. If you want to achieve greatness -- or even just the next item on your bucket list -- you're not going to get there by simply staying afloat. Take charge of your day with enthusiasm instead of shrugging off responsibility.","It's time to be a good sport and cheer on the people you care about! Even though something that's exciting to your friends or family members might not appeal to you, you should show some interest in their chosen hobbies or favorite activities. Think of how much you'd appreciate them doing the same for you whenever the time comes. It doesn't take a grand display -- just showing your support will be enough to let them know that you care.","Someone close to you may not seem like the coolest person to hang out with, but they likely look up to you and would love to have your support. While it can be hard to swallow your pride and show them that you're willing to support them even when it might go against your image, there are more important things than how cool people think you are. Chances are, you're showing this person that you really care, and that's what matters most.","Explaining your feelings aloud can be difficult, but the silent treatment will not get you anywhere right now. If there's something that you know needs to be said, it would be better to bite the bullet and just say it as soon as possible rather than waiting and waiting. No matter how uncomfortable the idea of speaking up is, if you take too long, you may find that you've missed your opportune moment. Don't wish the day away, seize it!","Creating your own emotional security will feel ten times better than relying on others to build you up. Currently, someone may be criticizing your actions, even if you truly feel like what you did was the right thing. Regardless of critics trying to tempt you to bow down and please them, ask yourself if you tried to do what felt right and natural to you. If you feel good about your actions and they didn't hurt anyone, it's okay to defend yourself.","All work and no play could be draining your soul. You may have been devoting too much time to being responsible, avoiding rest and relaxation out of a fear of being criticized or a burning desire to be the best. Your efforts to achieve great things are admirable, but you won't be any good to yourself or to others if you're burnt out. Right now, give yourself the freedom to reconnect with who you are so that you remember why you do what you do.","Neglecting your spiritual side will eventually wear on you, and you're probably noticing the toll it's taking. Spending too much time in the material world or trying to forge your way through an urban jungle may have caused you to feel cut off from your intuition -- it's time to remedy that. Spend a few hours cleaning up your environment so the energy flows more smoothly, and then you can devote some time to meditation or creativity, allowing you to express your soul.","Trying to impress someone may entice you to act out of character. Peer pressure could be pushing you to deny the unique person you are in order to better fit in. However, the longer this goes on, the more unnatural it will feel once you're alone, looking at yourself in the mirror. When you push your true self away, you only do a disservice to yourself. Take today to unapologetically be who you really are -- your courage could inspire others as well!","You may be hesitating in order to protect yourself, but holding back will only keep you in the same spot. It's okay to be concerned about new responsibilities -- after all, many people worry about change, and no one wants to let the people around them down. Consider that you could feel a twinge of disappointment if someone else steps up and does a lesser job than you know you could have done. If you know you have the potential, why not try?","Once you no longer enjoy something that you used to really love, moving on can be difficult. Still, you know when the honeymoon period is over. You can try coaxing yourself into thinking that it's still as fun as it once was, but truthfully, you probably need a change of pace. The activity or hobby will more than likely still be there if you want to return to it someday, but there's no point in making something that was once fun into a chore.","Belittling yourself or surrounding yourself with people who do the same is no longer acceptable. You might have only accepted and believed in pessimistic ideas out of a fear of being let down, but this is preventing you from ever feeling excitement or anticipation for any possible good outcomes. You also may have been selling yourself short in the process! Even if you're normally more motivated by boos than cheers, it could be time to find a new form of inspiration.","Asking for what you want outright could feel too bold, but it's worth it to try. You might be trying to avoid potential conflict by not speaking up for yourself, but in truth, no one can read your mind -- they won't know what you want if you don't ask for it. There may even be someone who could give you what you're looking for without being inconvenienced at all. If you know you need something, don't be afraid to say so!"
2021-08-12,"Quiet and slow isn't a bad thing! We don't have many astrological influences to anticipate today, which allows us a chance to survey the world around us and see how we can improve it, even in a small way. The emotional Moon trines serious Saturn at 8:32 am EDT, giving us an opportunity to fix up the details, plus the time to do so at our own pace. Be dedicated to what matters, and realize there's no reason to be rushed."," A leisurely pace is fine to indulge in now. You might feel the urge to pack up your car and possibly your loved ones and take a big trip, but just an afternoon at the local park or a drive alongside a beautiful part of where you live might be enough. Aries are prone to being ambitious, but you'll feel better if you pace yourself instead of trying to do a lot in a small amount of time.","Close conversations with the people who know you best are on the agenda today. The conversations can range from simple to serious, and you may even find yourself discussing topics that you have never broached before with family members or other people you live with. It's easier to set boundaries now with people who won't usually listen, and to talk about difficult issues from the past without dredging up negative feelings. Speak honestly with those around you today and avoid fudging the truth.","Although today's energy has no urgency to it, it's still a time to act on what you're really thinking and move forward. You're meant to leave behind pretenses and situations that no longer fit you, even if it takes a little time. Be methodical if you need to be, but if you are truly feeling the urge to move away from a situation that no longer serves you, then make sure you eliminate the temptation to go back to it. Cutting these old ties can feel freeing.","Clutter might be holding you back right now, either physically or emotionally. Material objects that you received during an important time in your life can hold a certain sentimental nature, but sometimes they're also carrying memories that you don't need to revisit at the expense of your freedom. Today the universe is encouraging you to let go of what you're currently holding on to so tightly, so that you're able to make space for the new adventures you're dreaming about.","What wasn't so serious before may feel heavier today. You might take things too seriously, and this can be both a gift and a curse. While this can help you become more committed than you have been to yourself in self-care and in your own ambitions, it can also cause you to be too hard on yourself while you're trying to have fun. You can always change the rules for yourself if you want to, but try to avoid chastising your past self for your decisions. It's in the past!","Guidance can come in mysterious ways now... You might have been dealing with an issue or a decision that just isn't getting clearer in the way that you've been hoping it would. While researching and making lists of pros and cons usually works, you may need a bit more spiritual insight this time. Pay attention to your dreams or random memories of past friends or relatives that come to you, because they can provide you with the insight you're looking for.","The less that's said, the more you may hear now. You could be more sensitive to what people aren't saying, and they might not be aware of how their lack of response is affecting you. It's okay to have expectations of how others will treat you, but try not to overreact if you'’re not receiving thank-you letters or large displays of affection. Thanks and love may come to you in more simple ways than you thought they would, but see them as coming from the heart.","Your energy tank may be on empty today, which could be the result of pushing yourself to do more than you had stamina for yesterday. It's important that you move at the pace that you feel, not at the pace others might be pushing you into. It's okay to take care of yourself rather than diving straight back into the demanding speed that you've been a part of, because listening to your body is your highest priority right now.","Spending some time by yourself could be the best thing for you now. A whirlwind of appointments and meetings with others may have been spinning your head recently. Although there are those who might desperately want your company and want it right now, it's okay if you're socially drained and would rather take in a cozy night by yourself. If you do take someone up on their invitation to get together, make sure it's with someone who helps you to feel recharged.","Saying everything is fine isn't going to fix anything. There could be a situation that is pulling you into its orbit that you're not interested in, and now you’re not sure how to pull the plug without hurting feelings or closing future doors for yourself. While it makes sense to be cautious, simply ducking out altogether or pretending that everything is okay won't cut it. Do the mature thing and make it clear that you've got other plans.","It's easier to be serious today, but it's also easier to be harsh. You may mean well when doling out advice, yet it could be taken the wrong way if you deliver it without making an attempt to show any emotion behind your words. In turn, others might be more willing to say what they're really thinking about you, but there’s a difference between constructive criticism and just critiquing for the sake of talking. Watch your criticisms, and watch your critics as well.","Work can be draining right now, and your plate may be overfilled. It's tempting to fall into the mindset that if you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself. However, since you're only one person, you can't do everything right at once, and you likely don't have the capacity to do the full extent of the job for everyone around you. If you're noticing that there’s too much on your hands, pass some of it to the person next in line, and trust."
2021-08-13,"Success today comes from equal parts luck and active input. With the sensitive Moon's sextile to the confident Sun, we feel ready to take on whatever comes our way, but the Moon's square to chaotic Pluto throws us a curveball. It may take a little maneuvering to get around this roadblock, but Luna's trine to generous Jupiter at 4:39 pm EDT gives us a helping hand. Finally, the Moon enters intense Scorpio and gives us a chance to celebrate our victories with those who supported us.","Work may get in the way of fun plans that you had for the day. You could get called in when you weren’t expecting to be there, or a responsibility that you thought was someone else’s may get handed over to you instead. Thankfully, you can get by with a little help from your friends, and in your case, maybe coworkers. Your fun plans might require a little reworking before you can take part in them, but you’ll still get a chance to enjoy yourself.","Travel may be rudely interrupted today, requiring some creative readjustments. You may have made all the plans and curated them to perfection, but something unforeseen can throw you off course. Despite your best-laid plans falling apart, someone that you consider to be an important or authoritative figure in your life can come to your rescue by stepping in and giving you a helping hand. Don’t be afraid to ask for support, because swallowing your pride can be the easiest way to get out of a jam.","It’s time to be tough, even if you’re feeling out of your element. You might be someone who prefers to work using a less confrontational or less physical approach and leave yourself out of the heavy lifting. However, the hands-on approach may be unavoidable now, and you could find yourself putting on your work boots and doing the dirty work. Don't hide from it -- you’ll feel proud of yourself once you’ve finished, and you may be rewarded with a fun opportunity you weren’t expecting.","Relationships can go a little haywire today, but it’s nothing that some compromising can’t fix. Someone important to you may not hold up their end of the bargain, creating a need for you to hold up their end as well. Thankfully, you should have the resources to do so without much effort. While you might be mad, it’s best to just let it go without causing the other person to feel bad. Odds are, they were unable to fulfill their promise for a good reason.","Your body might not want to go along with your plans, creating a hiccup in your routine. Whether it’s simply a lack of energy or you are a little under the weather, take care of yourself and don’t try to overdo it, even if it means missing out on something. Pushing yourself too far will only result in more to deal with. When you're ready to get back to your schedule, someone can help you pick up the slack, so don’t feel like the world is on your shoulders.","Forgetfulness and losing track of time are your main enemies now, but they’re easily thwarted. Although everything seems to be in its right place, making a list and checking it off will help you make sure that you don’t miss any all-important details. Time flies when you’re having fun, and you may get distracted today and think that you’re done working, when in reality, you forgot something. It’s best to save fun until you’ve finished all the work.","Someone you live with can create drama for you when you least expect it. Thankfully, you’re likely to be emotionally even and balanced in your own skin, preventing you from being knocked off your game. Sometimes you’re more tuned in to the feelings of others, but today you’re able to stand on your own confidently in the crowd, and this will help you stick up for yourself. Don’t let anyone push you around and you will succeed.","Transportation issues may prevent you from getting where you’re trying to go. The person that you normally carpool with may bow out, or you might try to start up your car and find that it’s not wanting to cooperate. Even if it’s just getting stuck in traffic, instead of letting this get you down, chalk it up to the energy of the day and keep things moving, mentally at least. There will probably be some hiccups for everyone, so whoever you’re hurrying to meet will likely understand.","Keeping the lines of communication open can help prevent snafus today. There may be an issue that someone calls you about but you don't see the call, or you could receive an important email that ends up in the spam folder. While miscommunication in general can be a problem now, making sure that you don’t miss any messages is how you can still succeed. Texting twice to confirm plans or calling just to double check the details won't hurt, and you can avoid hurt feelings this way.","It may cost a little extra money to keep you on track right now. You might find yourself needing to buy something unexpected, or perhaps a surprise bill pops up. But whether someone forgets to bring their wallet to the restaurant or you forgot about that payment that is now a little on the late side, you should have the money to cover it. Having a generous heart and an open mind is what you need most right now.","Expect the unexpected today, and be ready to take charge. Distractions are likely to come out of nowhere, but you can defeat them without much trouble. A misplaced item may cause you to rush a little more while preparing for your day, so you might want to start getting ready a little earlier than normal if you have somewhere important to be. Try not to drive yourself crazy if you can't find that pesky item, just have faith that it'll turn up soon.","Too many people giving input can cause an information overload for you. You might be minding your business and tell someone what's going on in your life, and then they unexpectedly give you all of their advice as you're awkwardly trying to figure out how to respond. It's okay to say you'll think on it and leave it at that. Your luck is more likely to come from an unexpected place, when there's no one else around making your head spin with opinions."
2021-08-14,"It's time to act with tenacity -- but not recklessness. The sensitive Moon sextiling agile Mercury quickens our movements, while the Moon's square with stubborn Saturn at 11:54 am EDT could cause us to be grumpy without quite knowing why. The Moon then sextiles Mars, adding to our energy and fire. If we don't direct it well, the Moon's later opposition to rebellious Uranus could cause us to spin out of control. Without a game plan today, we should wait for better timing before making any moves.","A shock to your security could cause you to give up before you can even see the finish line. You may want to stick to the smaller stuff today, choosing to handle the routine issues that you know you can manage rather than trying to take on any new or bigger responsibilities. While you don't have control over what tasks you're handed, do what you can to stay in your regular lane, and you should be able to move through the day with ease.","Agitation and frustration may cause you to slip up if you're not careful. While you're normally able to easily control yourself, someone may get under your skin today and make it hard to keep your natural composure. Teaching others may also be more difficult than usual now, so if you have to, let students or other less-experienced people in your midst be hands-on and learn for themselves. You don't have to hold their hands at every moment -- let them take the reins!","You might make commitments today while you're in a good mood, but you may end up biting off more than you can chew. Even if you have a lot of energy while at home or around people you're comfortable with, all that vigor could fade the moment you leave your element. Focus on your corner of the world now -- that's where you'll be able to do the most good. Bigger challenges will still be there in the future when you have more energy.","Today is better for making plans than for executing them. The current energy supports you being verbally and mentally creative -- but it doesn't necessarily give you the crowd that you need to support your vision. If you try to delegate or give your instructions to others now, you could find that you end up with a result far from what you really wanted. Lay the groundwork by yourself. You can always hand others their piece of the big picture tomorrow.","Opportunities to spend abound today, but this isn't the right time. While someone might push you to buy something or to sign a contract right away, there may be hidden fees or missing details that you aren't privy to yet. Instead of jumping into the deep end without hesitation, save your money for a sure bet. If you let your cash burn a hole in your pocket and spend it all on the first offer, you could miss out when a great opportunity does come along!","You're your own best advisor today, even if that doesn't quite make sense to you yet. The answers you need are probably already in your mind, and trying to seek out the help of more experienced people isn't likely to pan out the way it should. Your internal perspective will be more useful now than any outside perspective, even that of people you respect. No matter how well they mean, others just may not understand exactly what you need. Trust your instincts.","People that you don't usually turn to could end up being your salvation now. This may be someone that you don't know well or somebody you haven't seen in a while, but either way, today's best friend might be someone you wouldn't expect. Those that you'd normally go to for guidance are likely busy or might not truly understand what you're asking for. As long as you're willing to give back in return, you should be able to find all the help you need today.","It's OK to rely on your loved ones if you're in need today. Before shunning the help or assistance of others, ask yourself if you truly have to do this on your own. Could you be trying to avoid getting hurt by controlling the situation? There's nothing wrong with being strong, but you don't have to fly solo when there are people who want to help you. While not everyone has their support system behind them, you likely will, so take advantage of that!","Leaving any festivities until tomorrow may be for the best. While you can be a powerhouse when taking care of business today, by the time you get home you might discover that your energy has been depleted. Agreeing to hang out with pals or start any home projects after you're done tending to work or other responsibilities could come back to bite you. Try to leave your plans as open-ended as possible, because you may find that once you make it through the door, all you want is to lounge around.","Your familiar routine just isn't giving you the energy you need today. Breaking out of your everyday schedule to find inspiration will sound ideal, but those around you may discourage this. They might not see the need for you to take a short trip somewhere new, especially just to watch a movie or window shop, but you're due for a mental reset. The best way you can achieve this is through immersing yourself in an unfamiliar place. Let your mind wander and flow as it will!","If you're in a professional partnership or a financial relationship with one or more of your family members, this could create unexpected issues for you now. Even though they're excited about something that they perceive to be a good deal, it may take your input to ensure they don't make a mistake with your shared resources. Do your best to encourage them to wait on any big monetary decisions for the time being. There's no need to rush, especially when it comes to business matters.","Someone may create more work for you today, even if they meant well. This person probably wanted to help out when they signed you up for something or made a commitment on your behalf, but it might end up being more trouble for you than they realized. However, even though they made a blunder, it could still work out for you. Things that are a little messy now can also benefit you by setting you up in some way for future success."
2021-08-15,"Emotions are tied up in dreams, but life brings us back down to earth. The sensitive Moon is active today, coloring our world with vibrant feelings. She trines dreamy Neptune at 10:33 am EDT, highlighting creativity and sentimentality as well as softening life's rough edges. Later, the Moon's square with the confident Sun brings us back to reality, and her square to expansive Jupiter keeps us on a central path. Creating plans that harmonize our ideals with lessons learned will bring us to the right place.","Your friends have something to teach you -- as long as you're willing to listen. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you know everything, especially when you're often right about your hunches, but it's worth it to hear others out right now. Remember, most of your knowledge came from someone else at some point, and as a human being, you're meant to keep learning for your entire life. Stay open to new lessons, because a quality one might appear today.","Professional or personal tasks can't get in the way of your good vibes for too long. Stress from work or other obligations can cause headaches as you dream of hanging out with your friends and having fun. It might feel like your responsibilities are dragging on as the passage of time slows to a crawl, but there is an end in sight! Good times are in your near future, once everything is done. If you can, try finding little ways to have fun to help pass the time.","You may find yourself stuck spinning your wheels right now. Rather than giving up when you find yourself struggling to learn something new or teach someone else, stick with it. It can be discouraging when you don't get something right away or when you feel you're unable to easily share what you know with someone else, but practice makes perfect. Keep trying -- no matter what happens, you'll feel more fulfilled knowing that you gave it your best shot!","Someone may bring you fresh information today, and whether it's good or bad, it could change your perspective on a belief that you've held for quite some time. You may be tempted to move on with your life without bringing these facts along with you, but once you know something, it's hard to forget it. Deciding what to do with this new knowledge is up to you. Instead of immediately throwing it out the window, allow yourself time to integrate it into your worldview.","The people who love you are here to help tether you to reality now. While daydreams can take us to places that we want to go, they can also take us towards worries and potential futures that we don't necessarily need to focus on. Your mind may be racing with what-ifs today, but those who are most important to you can bring you back from this unstable space. There's no need to spiral about unlikely crises or cry over milk that hasn't spilled yet!","The potential a situation has can sweep you off your feet today, distracting you from any red flags. You may meet someone that seems so perfect or have an interview that feels like it couldn't go wrong, but make sure you're being realistic. Instead of hanging all your dreams on one person or on a single career option, keep your eyes open for all the possibilities, both positive and negative. There's so much out there for you, as long as you're willing to look for it.","Getting caught up in your to-do list is all too easy today. You might find yourself pushing through work or chores as time marches forward, and before you know it, the whole day will be gone! Even once you're doing something enjoyable with your family or friends, you may find your mind wandering to what you need to do tomorrow. Do your best to remain present. You won't get the benefits of relaxing and enjoying yourself if your thoughts are still focused on your responsibilities.","Not all advice is meant for everyone. Even if someone confidently insists that they know what's best for your life, letting other people dictate your actions today could send you way off course. Feel free to listen to their input, but before actually using it, go through the possible results in your head. Is that outcome really what you want to happen? Being confident in your own thoughts and actions will give you the mental support to stand by your decisions through any naysaying.","Your mind may be focused on matters at home, rather than what's right in front of you at the moment. Family issues or home improvement problems might distract you from your tasks at hand, creating even more of a problem for you than they were at the beginning of the day. Instead of getting caught up in what could be waiting for you when you get off work or meet up with family members, try to concentrate on one thing at a time."," If you don't feel like you have the right thing to say today, it's okay not to say anything at all. Something might be weighing on your mind, making you feel as if you need to address it out loud so you can get it off of your chest and stop worrying about it. However, rushing into the words you want to say could cause even more issues. The best choice is to hold off until you're absolutely certain of what you want to say.","Anxiety can create a lack of self-esteem if you let it. You have opportunities to go for the gold right now or to at least improve your living conditions in some way. You may spend time today convincing yourself that you're not ready for something that you, in actuality, are ready for! Don't let impostor syndrome team up with your imagination and tell you that you're someone you're not or that you can't do this. Instead, boost yourself up by remembering all that you've already accomplished.","The ideas of others may sound particularly enticing today, especially if you're listening to a peer speak excitedly about something that interests them. While there's nothing wrong with taking some inspiration, ask yourself if you're just imitating what someone else wants rather than what would be best for you. There's plenty of room for everyone's interests, so don't let who you are fall to the wayside just because you're enamored with someone else's self-expression. Make sure that the dreams you chase are your own!"
2021-08-16,"Putting on airs can't take the place of clear communication today. Beautiful Venus enters its home sign of social Libra at 12:27 am EDT, bringing a sense of harmony to the atmosphere. However, with the sensitive Moon squaring communicative Mercury, a wrench will be thrown into our well-meaning words. While the Moon sextiling disciplined Saturn speaks from a place of clear-cut and defined ideas, the Moon squaring fiery Mars might have tempers flaring. We must choose our words carefully ... or suffer the consequences.","Someone might push your buttons today, but it's up to you to control your response. Whether they mean to or not, this person could bring up someone or something that really bothers you or a bold opinion that rubs you the wrong way. You have the inner grit to make sure you keep a cool head and not give in to whatever fight they're egging on. Stay above the fray by saying only what needs to be said and not everything you're thinking.","Jumping to conclusions could get you into trouble today. You may be tempted to react to a situation, but you should first ensure that it's what you think it is before losing control. Oftentimes it's easier to blow things out of proportion than it is to rationally think through what's actually going on, and this is probably one of those times. By taking a step back, you may realize that even if it's as bad as you think it is, it will resolve itself quickly.","You may have a disagreement today with someone you normally agree with, and you won't know how to handle it. Instead of turning your discourse into a battle of wits, try to gently work in your own opinion on the matter. If it seems like they're only looking to change your mind, you don't have to give in. You don't have to win or lose a fight to feel fulfilled, so it may be best to hear each other out and agree to disagree.","It's possible you'll feel physically depleted today, with your body unable to go as far as you'd like it to go. Even if you try to push yourself beyond your limits, you likely won't get as far as you'd like to do. Whether this is a fitness goal, a sports competition, or even just trying to get through the day without feeling sluggish or sleepy, it's OK if you fall short in the end. You'll always have the opportunity to get up and try again tomorrow.","Maintaining tranquility in your environment today could be a more daunting task than expected. The people around you might not be able to see eye to eye on issues that are important to them, creating stressful surroundings that cause your own priorities or even just your peace of mind to fall apart. Try to breathe through it and recognize there's only so much you can do. You can't control their actions, but you can control the way you respond to them.","The place that's normally your area of solace could feel more chaotic than calm today. Someone or something may have unexpectedly wreaked havoc on it, leaving you without a spot to go to when you need to take a breather. You might initially feel overwhelmed by the thought of needing to fix it up, but take a moment to collect yourself. You'll soon realize that everything that's undone can be put back together, and you'll be back to enjoying your peaceful place sooner than you think."," Someone could bring up a subject today that you are incredibly passionate about. You may initially shy away from sharing your thoughts, believing it isn't the time to make your opinions known. However, adding your input could help the other person feel like there's someone in their corner on the matter. Don't let the nagging little voice inside of you convince you to keep quiet. It never hurts to let someone know they're not alone.","Respect will be a central theme for you throughout the day. Someone may disrespect you -- or you may even disrespect yourself in some way. You should remedy this before it goes any further, but that doesn't mean you need to verbally attack anyone who crosses you. Calmly but firmly let people know where your boundaries are, as this will ensure you're being heard when you're speaking. After all, it's not just what you say but how you say it that matters.","Watch what you say today, as it could inadvertently land you in hot water. You may hold harsh opinions on something, even if you really aren't that serious about it. Speaking carefully will help keep you from accidentally making someone in your midst upset with you. While it's possible you'll be the victim of someone else's acerbity, you're more likely to be the one with the acid tongue. Try to be extra gentle in your communications and you'll avoid any pitfalls.","You may beat yourself today up over a perceived failure or flaw that isn't actually your fault. The danger in this is that the rest of the world will be ready to jump in with you if you're starting the attack on yourself. Instead of setting yourself up for this, try to see how you can improve and commit to doing better next time. There's no need to be your own enemy. Others will follow your lead, so be mindful of which direction you lead them in.","You'll likely have a strong desire to stand out from the crowd right now, but despite your strong sense of individuality, the people around you may have different ideas. Instead of trying to go against the grain, it may be best to follow the group in this instance. Don't let your desire to do your own thing get in the way of what's best for you and everyone around you. Spend more time today listening than acting on personal desire.","Sometimes it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when you've been struggling with something, but you're given an opportunity to buckle down and do the hard thing anyway. If times get hard today, let discipline be your guide. This may be an exercise of faith for you, but trust that things will get better if you keep chipping away at it. Some of the best things in life will require your sincere effort, so don't give up now."
2021-08-17,"What sounds good and what's actually good for us will be juxtaposed today. The emotional Moon squares dreamy Neptune at 1:19 pm EDT, asking us to take off our rose-colored glasses in order to truly see ourselves. The Moon's trine to the confident Sun encourages us to live our truth and go after what will make us happy, while Luna's sextile to expansive Jupiter powers our desire to grow. It's time to look past the now and choose the path that will fulfill us in the future.","You may attempt to substitute one kind of happiness for another today. Look at your choices when it comes to pleasure and ask yourself if what you're chasing after is really what you want. Don't allow yourself to be distracted by things like what someone else wants for you or what you think will make you the most money. The more honest you are about what you need to feel happy and fulfilled, the better you'll understand how to move about your day.","It may be time to reconnect with someone you haven't spoken to in a while. Someone could pop up in your mind over and over throughout the day, and although you will want to reach out, you'll be hesitant to do so. If this is about something that happened between you in the past, try to swallow your pride and contact them. While it can be hard, you'll never know what will happen if you don't take that step.","Staying disciplined may not come easily now. It's possible you've recently started a new routine that you're bound and determined to stick with. However, things will pop up today that will act as distractions, or it may be that you realize you simply don't have enough hours in the day to do it all. Perhaps the root of the issue is that you're trying to fit too many different plans into your life at once. See if simplifying your goals helps you to stick to them more completely.","Your sense of security could be threatened by unexpected information you receive today. Someone you've trusted for a long time might hurt your feelings or let you down in a crucial moment. While this can be difficult to heal from, it may be that you need to re-evaluate your trust and the people that you allow into your inner circle. It's likely that this relationship can grow from this, but it may take time -- and an apology from the other party.","Giving in to a fear of failure could cut you down when you need to stand firmly on a matter. You could be thwarted by imposter syndrome, whether that's in the form of your own worries or encouraged by someone in your midst. Don't let internal or external dialogue fuel your self-doubt. If your confidence is shaken today, think back to other times in your life when you overcame the odds. Trust that if you were able to rise above it before, you can do it again.","Tuning into your spiritual side could help you resolve a disagreement with someone important to you today. This will be a hard situation to navigate, and while you may believe there's one right way to approach this, your intuition will clue you into something else entirely. This will be something that is more obscure or off the wall but is ultimately the better option. When someone's feelings are on the line, it's sometimes best to let your gut be your guide.","Energy may be in short supply for you, so listening to your body and honoring what it tells you will be of importance today. There will be so many people to see and so many places to be, but you're just one person. In fact, your friends might suggest staying up late and partying the night away. Before agreeing to any plans, you should first make sure your body is on board. It's just as important to prioritize your well-being as it is your social activities.","It's OK to step up and be a leader, especially if the situation demands it. An event that requires your unique talents or knowledge may crop up today and push you to get over your desire to play the background character. If you decide to command the situation, you may be surprised at how willing others are to let you step into the spotlight. Share with them what you know and watch as they sit back and appreciate you at work.","Stepping outside of your comfort zone is on the agenda today. You could be feeling more sensitive to the thoughts or opinions of others, even if you're normally a very confident or free-thinking person. This might be due to being in an unfamiliar environment or in the presence of people you really respect and admire. Whatever the case may be, don't let intimidation stand in the way of your success. Be bold and don't be afraid to talk to those who inspire you.","Sometimes it's difficult to find the right words in a conversation. You might be stumped when someone catches you off guard today, and the awkward silence that follows may have you kicking yourself later on when you think of what you should have said. Being kind and understanding when responding to others, as well as giving them the benefit of the doubt, is the right approach now. If you do find yourself at a loss, just think about how you would want to be treated in the same situation.","You're feeling your independence lately, but you might have taken on more than you can handle when something unexpected adds itself to your long list of things to do today. Though you may want to be a superhero and knock out every task on your own, you could save yourself stress by letting someone else hold a bit of the burden. Lean on the people who love you, even if it doesn't feel like the most natural thing to do.","The work blues could get you down today, so let someone who loves you pick you back up. A rough day at the office or a series of difficulties will disappoint you, but you may not want to make anyone else sad with your feelings about the day. Instead of isolating yourself, grant a loved one the opportunity to cheer you up and remind you about the good things you have to look forward to. It'll be nice to be distracted by a little fresh positivity."
2021-08-18,"After some minor compromises, we're looking at smooth sailing and speedy recoveries. The sensitive Moon squaring harmonious Venus may require us to make a little sacrifice in order to keep the peace. Communicative Mercury then conjuncts bold Mars at 11:28 pm EDT, increasing our ambitions and our confidence -- but it could also make us speak rashly. Thankfully, our emotional intelligence is heightened with the Moon trining Mars and then Mercury. It'll be easier to say what we're thinking with kindness as well as honesty.","Expect your routine to go by faster than normal. You're likely to have more energy and better focus now, so take advantage of that and get ahead on those projects that you weren't able to find time for in the past. Cleaning the garage or reorganizing your room won't seem as daunting with your other responsibilities out of the way, and you'll be able to handle it all with ease. Use the extra gas in your tank while you've got it!","Something that you may have been dreading is ready to be tackled! Nothing will make you feel more accomplished than eliminating what you're procrastinating. Even if the desire to put it off still lingers, push that to the side and forge onward. You'll take stress off of yourself by finally buckling down and making it happen while the wind is in your sails. Once it's done, you can breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy the feeling of freedom.","While this could be a day where you catch up on a lot of housework, it could also be a day where you find yourself in the middle of a family dispute that causes you to shake your head in bewildered confusion. Tension may crop up among family members, but try to keep your cool, because adding fuel to the fire won't benefit anyone. You could help by thinking of something that the whole family can do together, because anyone feeling left out just won't do.",Your words and your mind may be moving faster than your body at the moment. This is one of those days when you might not be able to write or type as fast as your brain comes up with words to say or you may be speaking a mile a minute. Others might not be able to keep up with such a speedy flow of information! Make it a point to put the brakes on when you explain things so that you're not misunderstood.,"A chance to build your sense of security is being presented to you. You may spend some time today with someone who sees you for who you are and who is able to beautifully build up your strengths. While it's good to be humble, keep what they're saying in the back of your mind as you go through the rest of your day. Pride in your accomplishments may come naturally, but sometimes it takes an outside perspective to show you what you can really do.","Life isn't about being too serious at the moment, so you can indulge in a bit of fun and exercise. Go for a hike, play some informal sports with friends -- anything, as long as you're enjoying fresh air and getting your body moving. If physical activities aren't appealing right now, though, don't try to force yourself to work through the whole day. It likely won't result in what you're trying to accomplish, so let loose and have fun!","Today is more about the journey than the destination. You may feel very impatient to get something done or to get somewhere by the end of the day, but you're meant to pay attention to all the people you meet and places you visit along the way. Your energy might not be very high right now, so take it easy and don't rush to the finish line. You'll be happier making the most of every step you take to get there.","Ideas could have trouble finding you inside the fog of your mind. You may be feeling a little lost on your own, or a project you're working on just isn't coming together. Turn to the people who support you for inspiration -- they'll probably be happy to give you some fresh concepts. Trying to do it all on your own won't work as well as getting input from the people who want you to succeed. Let your friends guide you to victory!","The authority figures in your life are lighting a fire under your ambitions. Someone that you look up to, or at least someone who has power over your life, may say something that makes you want to do more for yourself. Whether they're providing positive or negative reinforcement, you'll likely find yourself more determined to make your dreams come true by the end of the conversation. You don't have to wait around for this person either -- seize the day and start connecting!","It might be time to get out of the house! A change of scenery can do wonders for any cabin fever or online meeting fatigue. You might feel selfish, but it's okay to let yourself relax and do something today that you really enjoy. Whether it's a spa night so that you can chill out after a long day of working or a drive through the countryside to clear your mind, give yourself permission to take a step back and recharge in whatever way you like.","There's no time like the present to revisit your long-term goals. Someone in your life may encourage you to begin planning for the future, and you should listen. Sit down with a person who can help you invest in your future somehow, either with money or with your health, and try to start working on positive new habits. At the very least, you can work toward your goals by making -- or updating -- a vision board. Let your ideal life take shape!","The social butterfly in you is ready to spread its wings! You will likely find yourself flitting from friend group to friend group today, both online and off. If you're the type of person who gets along with people from many different walks of life, expect this to be an interesting day. Even if your network is smaller, everyone has something to say if you've got the time to indulge them. The more open and willing to listen you are, the more enjoyment you'll get from this time."
2021-08-19,"Any changes that need to happen will be obvious today. The sensitive Moon trines rebellious Uranus right before Uranus turns retrograde, tuning into the frequency of change. The Moon's conjunction to transformative Pluto then packs a punch, surrounding everything with a sense of urgency. The egocentric Sun opposes expansive Jupiter and asks that we learn from our past before we get stuck in a loop. Once Uranus finally turns retrograde at 9:40 pm EDT, our beliefs that need updating will become abundantly clear.","Your budget might need a second look. Negative spending habits could catch up with you at this time, especially if you haven’t been disciplined with yourself lately. While it may be tempting to keep managing your money in the same way you always have, it might be wiser to either spend more on quality items that are made to last or cut out costs that are draining your bank account. Setting a long-term goal can help to make this process easier.","While you may want to make big changes to perceived personal flaws, you first have to see yourself for who you really are. That can be hard to do accurately. Try to think about the way you look at strangers. How would you look when seen through that lens? You might not be as judgmental of another person as you are of your own issues! When you realize you don’t have to be so hard on yourself, it may make it easier to change.","Reconnecting with your spiritual side may be necessary -- especially if you've been feeling lost lately, like you’re reaching out but nothing is reaching back. Let your dreams and even your daydreams or out-of-the-blue thoughts help you find the guidance that you need in these areas. Focusing intently on meditating or other methods of spiritual enlightenment may have the opposite effect to what you want. Try to let go and see what your mind shows you when it’s wandering freely.","Friends whose views no longer align with your path may currently be leaving your life. You could have felt this tension or disconnect before, but something that they say or do now is making it clear that this friendship isn’t what it used to be. It’s okay to move on when you realize a friend has grown in a different direction, and it doesn’t need to be a big issue or a dramatic parting of ways. After all, your paths may cross again someday in the future.","A job change may be on the horizon for you. Whether or not you actually change careers, you might realize that the way you’ve integrated your job into your life is no longer working for you. It could be closing you off from your friends if you’re working too many hours. On the other hand, you might decide that you want to spend more time working in order to bring in a heftier paycheck. Whatever the adjustment may be, make moves toward making it right.","Unlearning something can sometimes take more effort than learning it. A skill or a strongly held belief may have just been revealed as not the ideal way to go about things, and now you’re having to backtrack and regroup. Don’t feel as if this is a failure on your part, and don’t be afraid that you’ll never be able to forget this pattern. Just start growing and nourishing yourself like a tree, pruning away the dead branches and strengthening the healthy ones.","Worries must be released in order to make room for better futures. A deep fear could be cropping up in your mind now, either through dreams or your everyday thoughts. Even if what you’re afraid of is something that has actually happened in the world or in your past, it’s time to let go of this fear so that you can keep living your life. Letting this anxiety hang over you like a dark cloud won't do anything but keep you afraid.","Relationships and how you communicate within them are gearing up for a change. Perhaps you tend to play your cards too close to the chest or give up your secrets with an immediacy that you later regret. No matter how your communication negatively affects your relationships, it will make itself clear today. Still, everyone has weaknesses, and this doesn’t mean that you can’t control your impulses. Pay attention to how you communicate and ask yourself if it’s bringing you closer to others or pushing them away.","Your body will tell you if there’s something that you need to start doing for your own well-being. Noticing extra soreness or seemingly random aches could mean that you need to start stretching when you get up in the morning. If you’re exhausted upon waking up, extra rest in the night might be in order. Bodies always change with age -- when it’s time to start treating yours more conscientiously, it will let you know. Be willing to listen when you receive the signals.","Getting caught up in the hustle and bustle of life is all too easy, and simpler pleasures may have passed you by recently. It's time to introduce more fun into your day! A hobby that you haven’t picked up in a while might beckon to you again, or a new interest that is right up your alley could pop up in your line of sight. Give yourself time to enjoy life now, instead of just going through the motions.","Expect there to be new dynamics when it comes to family. Someone in your family may be moving away or starting a new job, making them less available to spend time with you. Alternatively, a loved one that you used to never see may begin showing up quite a bit due to some free time or closer proximity to you. Try to accept it as it is, but if you’re not comfortable with the new routine, you can adjust as needed.","A new addition to your support system could arrive today. You may not have expected this person to become someone that you can lean on when times get tough, but they will likely show up for you and support you in new ways if you give them a chance. They might talk you through some bad news or bring you a care package when you’re feeling under the weather. Be open to this person, even if you once thought of them differently."
2021-08-20,"Changes that need to be made can be much easier to maintain if we make them now. Thoughtful Mercury trines unique Uranus at 4:06 am EDT, encouraging us to think differently than we might normally. When the sensitive Moon enters innovative Aquarius shortly after, our emotions follow the trend of being outside the box. While the Moon's trine to open-hearted Venus helps us to love the changes that we implement, her conjunction to stable Saturn also solidifies our resolve so that we don’t go back on our word.","Your support system can really help to boost your self-esteem now, as long as you’re willing to listen. You may be someone who draws from within in order to support yourself. This is a great way to remain strong through the hard times, but sometimes your friends can see strengths that you’re not aware of from your own perspective. When you pursue your goals, make sure that you’re surrounding yourself with the people who want to see you win.","You may be at the end of your workweek, but you can still have fun in your last moments of work. There’s an easier energy in the air, and this is partly because everyone is ready for the weekend, but there’s an extra boost of fun from the planets in your corner. Don’t take things too seriously and enjoy the time that you spend with your bosses and coworkers. Making that extra effort to keep the mood positive can pay off for you.","Finding your zen could be easier than ever right now. Things may have felt more hectic than you were expecting recently, and perhaps you fell behind on activities that help you to feel at one with the universe. Whether this is being in nature, yoga, or meditating, it’s time to pick it back up with commitment and gusto. Don’t worry if it doesn’t come as naturally to you now that you’re out of practice, just start again from wherever you are now.","Someone from your past might be returning to your life. This person may have been thinking about you for quite some time, and now they’re ready to reach out again. It's possible you did not leave off on the best of terms, or you may not have even noticed that your relationship fell off at all. It’s up to you whether you let them back in or not, but it will help to notice how you feel when you think about being around them again.","Conversations with authority figures could help give you more stability now. It can be hard to hand over the reins, or even admit that your way may not be the best way, but someone that you consider a mentor or a boss might have good advice for you. Don’t feel as though your own experiences apply to everything, because others have been through events and experiences that you have not. Let someone else’s memories guide you to success.","Speaking your thoughts out loud can take you far right now. You may be wrestling with a decision, and thinking this decision through is only taking you in circles. After all this deliberating, you likely want to just pick a path and start going for it. Still, you know that one option will end in a better result, and you want to pick the right one if you can. Talking through your decisions with someone you trust can help you work it out.","Scheduling some time for fun can help break you out of a rut. You might feel stuck in your current routine, and this is probably because you’re letting good times fall to the bottom of your to-do list. Now that the weekend is near, try to find a structured way to enjoy yourself -- something with a set time that forces you to get out there and have fun. Even if you only have space for self-care at home, make sure the day doesn’t get away from you without it.","Giving can be even more fun than receiving today. There’s an opportunity for you to be generous as you go through your day, but you may be unsure of what to do when this opportunity arises. Go ahead and be giving when someone asks for your helping hand, because you’re more likely to find satisfaction from knowing you did something nice for someone else than you will from holding back. Some days are better for conserving your resources, but not today.","It's time to focus on quality over quantity as you curate your group of friends. You may be someone who has a lot of people around you, but perhaps there are more people who are acquaintances rather than true friends. Reach out today if someone special happens to pop into your head, but step back from people you don’t feel connected to. The people who come to mind when you think of your best friends are those you’re meant to relate with now.","Finances may be looking up for you finally. Relief could come if you’ve been feeling the weight of your bills lately, or some extra pocket money you've been expecting could make its appearance in your bank account. Either way, this development can help to encourage you and spark inspiration for the next steps in your life. If spending a little more on yourself with said money will help you to feel more like yourself, go ahead and indulge.","Don’t let your fears get you down. You may be more emotionally sensitive now, and worries could creep into your thoughts and actions if you’re not paying attention. Try to distract yourself by thinking about positive futures, even if they don’t seem as likely to happen at the moment. There’s no reason why the better outcome can’t be the one for you, especially if you’re prepared. The further you’re able to move your mind away from negative possibilities, the better.","Two heads are better than one. Collaboration is a good thing for you, especially right now, as it helps you to work through weaknesses and heighten your strengths and talents. Find someone who is good at the things you’re bad at and bad at the things you’re good at. Working together, you can accomplish anything that life throws at you. You may find that being on this tag team helps you to grow a closer bond as well."
2021-08-21,"We’ve got to look before we leap, even if the urge to leap is strong. The emotional Moon's square to rebellious Uranus at 6:12 am EDT colors the day with reckless energy. With the Moon in offbeat Aquarius and Uranus in stubborn Taurus, we might feel pulled in two directions that seem equally erratic, and the urge to act out of character is likely for even the steadiest of people. It’s best to wait until this nervous energy dissipates before making any decisions.","Impulse buys are a pitfall you'll want to swerve around today. It might be wisest to avoid browsing through your favorite internet shops or stay out of your preferred stores altogether, because you could fill up your shopping cart and spend your whole paycheck before you know what’s happened. Friends can even send you links to these temptations, so if there's something you’re saving for, stay strong and stick to the budget you set for yourself.","Watch out for stubbornness, because it can block your blessings. There may be a certain way that you like to do things, but being so firm in your ways could prevent you from getting the best outcome. There might be more than one person trying to convince you of a better way to do things, and if they seem to be in agreement, just hear them out. They very likely want the best for you, and they may see something that your blinders are preventing.","You may not be able to see the whole picture from your vantage point at the moment. Perhaps you hear just a piece of the story, or see something that seems to have a certain meaning, but you can't tell what’s going on from the information that you have. It’s a good idea to wait until more information trickles in before you make a decision about what someone’s intentions are. Acting too rashly will likely result in conflict that you don’t need.","Where you put your trust may be up for a change. Whether this is trust in the people around you or in ideas that you’ve believed in in the past, if it isn’t serving you well now, it’s time to place it somewhere else. Sometimes this can be hard to let go of, and it’s OK to do it gradually. Rash actions aren’t likely to benefit anyone, especially not you, so take your time and be gentle as you release.","It’s easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission, but it’s kinder to ask for permission. Especially now, be sure to ask before making a decision that will affect someone else, because others are likely to be more sensitive and on-edge. At the time, you might think that what you’re doing will benefit everyone, but they may not feel the same way. While you’re going through your errands and tasks, make sure that what you’re doing won’t offend someone else.","What you’re preaching right now may not apply to the people around you. Your keen eye can see the flaws in both your own plans and in others', and while advice might be springing forth from your lips, this can do more harm than good. Relationships could be strained if people feel that you’re passing judgment on their best efforts. Make sure that others are actually looking for your perspective before you give it to them voluntarily.","You could feel tempted to give up today before you’ve given it your best shot. There may be a project you’re working on that’s not quite turning out in the way you were hoping, or a relationship that’s just begun that’s beginning to put you off. Instead of throwing out everything because it’s not turning out perfectly, step back from it for now, and see if you can’t salvage it with fresh eyes next week. There’s a chance that you’re just not seeing things clearly at the moment.","Your emotions might be out of whack today due to someone insisting it's their way or the highway. Still, fighting back won’t work as well as compromising. While they might be in the wrong, matching their energy will only result in more tension between the two of you. You might as well lose the battle in order to win the war, because odds are, the other person will realize they were in the wrong on their own. Be the bigger person now, for your sake.","Someone may not follow through on their word, creating difficulties for you. It would be wise to get all your ducks in a row at the start of the day, because you might end up cleaning up after someone else in order to keep everything running smoothly for both you and them. This can be frustrating, but you’ve got the know-how to make sure everything works out. Try not to look at it as a disadvantage, because after this, at least they’ll owe you a favor!","You may have a wonderful opportunity to enjoy yourself today, but feel you need to pass on it so you don't look silly in front of people you wish to impress. First, make sure these are people that you want to impress for a real reason. You may come to find you have actually been judging yourself, but blaming these critical views on them. Ultimately, life is short, so if you want to have fun, then have fun!","Once you cast off the weights of the past, you can enjoy yourself more freely in the future. Old grudges may rear their heads today, trying to force you to let them bring you down, but there’s no reason to let them take over like that. The past is over now, and while you may never fully forget, there’s too much life to live to let bad memories force you into the shadows. Let this old energy fall behind you.","Speaking from the heart could lead to confusion rather than understanding today. You may feel a strong need to express yourself to someone in your life, but the words are more likely to come out in a big jumble instead of in the eloquent speech you want to give. You might very well have something important to say, but if it can wait until later, it's best to spend the day figuring out how you want to say it rather than jumping straight into speaking."
2021-08-22,"Big chances are ours for the taking! Passionate Mars' trine to rebellious Uranus may have everyone rushing to confess their love or fighting for what really matters to them. The Full Moon in individualistic Aquarius at 8:02 am EDT makes it feel like this is the last chance to express our feelings in an authentic way. Soon after, the Moon moves into sensitive Pisces and the Sun enters analytical Virgo, changing the vibes so that things don't feel so final. Breathe -- this is not truly our last chance.","Someone may be urging you to sign on the dotted line. They're insistent that now is the only time and that you'll miss out if you don't say yes right away. However, the voice of your intuition might be telling you that this isn't the opportunity they're making it out to be. You're likely right -- anything that sounds too good to be true probably is. Stick to your gut feeling and don't let anyone make you commit to something that feels wrong.","Feeling like you've missed the boat can bring you down today. You may be worrying that your best times are behind you, or that you haven't achieved everything you thought you would by now. Instead of letting these fears slow you down, remember that you still have so much life ahead of you. Just because things haven't exactly lined up with your mental timetable doesn't mean you need to panic. No matter your age, have faith that the best is yet to come!","Spiritual connections with your past could make themselves known. Looking through old family albums or listening to stories about family members that have passed on, even ones that you never knew, can help you learn more about yourself. Both the ways that you and your ancestors are alike and the ways you differ offer an opportunity to guide you as you shape your own future. If you have the chance today, ask someone in your family to tell you about the people you come from.","Daydreams may take over and cloud your visions for the future. This could rush you into a friendship or relationship with someone that you've come up with a story or identity for -- without really knowing who they are inside. This will likely put both of you at a disadvantage, because you'll end up with very different ideas for your time together. Today, let things progress organically, without planning how you want your new peer to act ahead of time.","The urge to cut and run from your responsibilities could strike at any moment. You might dread returning to work, instead desiring to set up a last-minute interview with another job, or you may find yourself partying the night away in an effort to avoid the consequences of tomorrow. Do your best to make responsible decisions instead of fleeing for the hills, because however you feel now, you'll probably still have to be there tomorrow anyway. Do it for future you!","Holding your temper can help you win the battle. You might currently be more hot-headed than normal, and your quick ire could lead to you snapping at the people in your life for irking you. Instead of letting the words and actions of others goad you into doing something you'll regret later, remember to breathe. Step back from what annoys you and be patient. If you can keep a cool head, then you've already solved the majority of your problems.","Your gut may lead you in a different direction than you were expecting. A plan that you made originally might need some adjusting now in order to keep everything moving smoothly. Someone may need your help as well, throwing you even further off course, but you'll know how to handle it on the fly. Don't adhere too rigidly to what you thought you'd be doing today -- you don't need to! Trust your intuition, even if it means you deviate from your routine.","You could meet someone today that you already know, but as the new person they've become. This may be someone you simply haven't seen in a while, or a person you see every day might reveal a side of themselves that they've never shown you before. Be open to accepting the new aspect of their personality that they're showing you, because rejecting them in favor of their past self or the person that you thought they were will likely hurt them. Remember, you're a complex person too!","The people around you could be experiencing some wild emotions today! Throughout it all, you're not likely to be the one going off the rails. Thanks to your level head, others might ask you to be their rock or their shoulder to cry on. Still, it's OK to cry with them if you feel moved or even if you just want to show them a little solidarity. After all, being calm doesn't mean that you don't have feelings at all.","There's a lot to be said for being a good listener. You may have a person in your midst who really needs someone else to talk to right now. You could brush them off, but the kinder thing to do would be to let them say their piece. You might have places to be, but you never know who really needs some affirmation. They may also ask for your advice. Even if they don't take it, just listening will likely make a difference.","Your emotions might be going full tilt today, so hold on and don't drive right over the edge! Letting your feelings run away with you is not the best course of action -- it would be better to take a deep breath and step back from any stressors. Even if it feels like everything's going wrong, odds are that things aren't as bad as you think they are. Finding the things that you're grateful for can help quell the emotional noise.","Speaking about your projects too soon could create issues. No matter how excited you are for your recent works to come to fruition, spilling the beans about any of these plans might jinx them! In addition, someone else may not want to see you succeed -- hidden efforts on their part could make your ultimate presentation lackluster. You shouldn't tell the world how many chickens you have before they hatch. Keep all that good news to yourself until it's finished."
2021-08-23,"Nothing that's built to last happens quickly. Romantic Venus trines stable Saturn at 8:48 am EDT, encouraging us to look at the big picture and do what benefits us in the long run. The sensitive Moon sextiling changeable Uranus inspires us to try something new, but her later opposition to passionate Mars can frustrate us once we leave our comfort zone. When the Moon opposes intellectual Mercury this evening, giving up entirely may sound tempting. Instead, take some time and go back to the drawing board.","You may learn a secret today that you would be wise to keep, even if you didn't ask to bear such a responsibility. Being a person who others can trust with their juiciest secrets will ultimately benefit you. You may feel tempted to tell friends or peers about it, and others, not knowing what you know, might even ask you for your input on the situation. Keep quiet for now -- you and the teller will both be thankful for it.","Confidence is on your side, but if you aren't careful, you may commit to more than you bargained for. Others are likely to see you as a leader who can lift them up, but you can only carry so many people. Don't feel as though you have to be there for everyone who beckons to you now, because that isn't your job. Do what you can to support the people you care about and let yourself be happy with what you're able to do.","Chaos and order are not balanced in your life right now. It can be hard to manage these two elements when dealing with others, because they're likely the ones causing this imbalance. People in your home may be the ones preventing you from both enjoying peace and having fun, as their desires or needs conflict with yours. Do your best not to add to the chaos of the day, but don't try to control it, either. Go with the flow.","Taking yourself out of your logical brain and letting emotional intelligence guide you may be difficult at the moment. Still, your heart is a more trustworthy navigator to follow right now. Someone may approach you, and although it might not seem like it at first glance, they need a helping hand or a kind word in order to get through their day. Instead of seeing them as competition or as an adversary, try and see them as another human being who needs kindness.","Moderation is key today. The idea of going overboard with your tasks and shining bright in the workplace might be enticing ... or you could want to throw your hands up and not try whatsoever. When the opposing ends of the spectrum are tugging on you, remind yourself that it's OK to play the middle sometimes, even though you may feel indecisive. You don't have to constantly stand out -- you can always take the lead or take a step back at a later time.","Reckless words can get you into trouble. Saying everything that pops into your head may lead to others feeling like you're more confrontational than you meant to sound. Take this moment to let others see your more sensitive side and think about what you're going to say before you say it. Sometimes the way we phrase things is just as or even more important than the actual message, because people could shut down and stop listening to you if they feel hurt.","Necessary rest may have escaped you this weekend. Today is a good day to show yourself a little extra love as you recharge. Even though you likely still have responsibilities to tend to, be sure to leave yourself time after they've been completed to catch up on relaxation. Spend some time pampering yourself! Maybe watch a movie you enjoy or have a nice, cozy dinner with a friend. You'll feel better if you can start off the week the right way.","Someone new might enter your life unexpectedly. This person may seem a bit unkempt or aggressive, but it could just be the day that they're having, and it would be a good idea not to judge them based on first impressions. Giving them the benefit of the doubt could lead to a valuable friendship or at least a helpful working relationship over time. Everyone's allowed to have a bad day on occasion -- don't let their rough moment define your whole relationship.","Mishaps may more common than usual, especially if you're not paying attention. It's easy to get distracted throughout your day, and mistakes like forgetting to check your planner or not looking where you're going could happen while you're distracted. Other people in your vicinity are also unlikely to be focused, so you may be watching out for more than just yourself. Being on your toes and avoiding recklessness will help you find success and avoid any pitfalls that are out there.","Relying on the people who love you is not a weakness. A project of yours might not be working out in the way you wanted it to, or just not as quickly as you'd prefer, and now you're reluctant to reach out and ask for help. While they may not show it right away, there are likely people who are both ready to help you and excited to spend time with you. There's no shame in needing a helping hand sometimes.","It's OK to spend some time alone just because you feel like it. You may not want to be a part of a big crowd, even if you don't have a particular reason to shy away from hanging out with people. We all need a little self-care sometimes, and if you need it today, then you should get it today! Let your friends know that you'll catch up with them later, and then you can have some space for your ""me"" time.","A bond with a special companion might be strengthening as you two get closer. However, be careful to remain genuine in your conversations. Trying to overcompensate for perceived differences by talking a lot is just going to dig you a deeper hole. If you act inauthentically, you could end up befriending someone who isn't right for you. Just be yourself! The right person will like and enjoy your company for who you really are, not who you pretend to be."
2021-08-24,"Our emotions can rule the day as the sensitive Moon's conjunction with dreamy Neptune prevents us from seeing clearly. Once the Moon sextiles transformative Pluto, we're forced to see what's really going on in order to live more vibrantly. The Moon then enters headstrong Aries, giving us an extra boost of self-confidence and strength. As long as we take baby steps, the disillusioning effect of intellectual Mercury opposite Neptune at 9:14 pm EDT won't stop us from following our dreams.","Energy can be low and time can be short now, so manage your expectations when you're making plans. There may be many people telling you to push ahead with several different opportunities, but don't feel bad about being picky. Ask yourself what you want most, whether it's time with someone special or space to work on that project that's been lingering in your mind. Don't feel like you have to do everything at once -- instead, prioritize and make life happen on your time.","You may have been feeling directionless lately, and the well-meaning people that have tried to guide you seem to only be leading you further into confusion. Sometimes this simply means that you're not meant to be moving forward -- that you're meant to enjoy your life as it is right now. Try to stop and smell the roses as you make your way through life today, without a strong plan to adhere to. Turning to your intuition can help you find the right way forward.","This is not the time to make large career decisions. You might feel tempted to take a big leap when it comes to your job situation, however, you may not be seeing the situation clearly. Miscommunications or misprints can throw you off in the workplace, and you will need to just focus on the day-to-day responsibilities in order to stay on track. Avoid job interviews or signing new contracts if possible, because they may not be presenting your new situation in its entirety.","Sometimes a change of scenery is all that you need. Getting out of your comfort zone doesn't have to be permanent to help you think more clearly. Someone may offer to take you out of your usual routine today, and while this isn't an invitation to shirk all your duties, you may be able to let one of your regular responsibilities slide in order to free your mind. Everything doesn't have to be hard and dutiful work -- let yourself relax a little.","Money can be deceiving now. While this could be your own financial situation or someone else's, you've got to stay on top of it in order to find success. Although someone may try to entice you with better pay or more perks, ultimately, it's likely not all that they're promising it is. This could be a job offer or a romantic proposition, but it's better to stick with what you already have for now. The grass probably isn't greener on the other side, no matter what they're proposing.","It can be especially challenging for you to communicate with others today, and vice versa. You may get some funny looks when you try to express yourself, but don't let this get you down. Stick with what you know and try to get your thoughts across as clearly as possible. Think through what you say before you say it. Explaining topics you're not familiar with probably isn't the best way to go, so let others take the reins if you need them to.","Family may step in to help you out now. Whether this is your biological family or just people that are emotionally close to you, this support can make you feel safer when things seem too difficult to handle. It's not always easy to let others jump in and help, but sometimes you need a break from making all the decisions on your own. Find a balance between maintaining your boundaries and letting loved ones in to assist.","The advice you receive today may not actually be based on what's going on in your life. The people around you could really be in their own heads, and despite their desires to help you out, they might be projecting more than they realize. Even if they say they know what's best for you, if it doesn't feel like their suggestions are right for you, stay strong. Let them down gently, but don't feel as if you have to follow every piece of advice given to you.","You might be feeling like the rope in a game of tug-of-war. This could be two people fighting over your affections or two people in charge trying to influence your choices, but either way, it can feel like you're between a rock and a hard place trying to please everyone. Instead of taking on all of this by yourself, realize that they shouldn't be so invested in your choices anyway. You're your own person and you can decide who to agree with, or to even pick a third option.","Be honest with yourself about the changes that you're experiencing. You might be of two separate minds right now, listening to both the past you and the present you, but they may not be getting along. If you're pushing yourself to stay in a stagnant place while simultaneously trying to be who you currently are, you'll end up feeling unfulfilled. Spend some quiet time today getting in touch with your current thoughts and desires and letting go of the past.","Even if you're the type to invest in your future and think several steps ahead, you may not be able to see these steps as well as you think you can. Not to mention, keeping your mind in the future can create a wall between you and what's really going on right now, so find a way to bring your thoughts back to the present moment. Trade out the long term for the short term when making decisions.","You're moving from a place of sensitivity to a place of security now. It's possible you have been deriving your worth from a secondary source that's no longer giving you the support that you need, so you're now looking for stronger and more level ground to stand on. While at first it may feel a little shaky, you'll be able to depend on yourself more once you realize that you're doing better than you think. There's nothing wrong with boosting your own confidence."
2021-08-25,"Today is about work that needs to be done, even if it isn't that appealing. The receptive Moon's sextile to disciplined Saturn encourages us to get down and dirty when it comes to fulfilling our obligations, with focus and trust in our abilities. However, the Moon's opposition to balanced Venus at 11:57 am EDT can cause us to be too enthusiastic when it comes to how we perform our duties, and it's up to us to create that extra equilibrium we might be lacking.","You may find yourself only wanting to spend time with one person right now, and this could be because they're saying all the right things. However, there's a difference between support and flattery -- someone who just flatters you may not have your best interests in mind. Make sure that you're making your decisions based on what's going to help you out in a real way, not just how someone else makes you feel in the moment.","Self-care is important, even when you're focused on an end goal. You might be caught in a form of tunnel vision right now, and although your drive is admirable, it may be too much and end up sending you back to the drawing board. Taking a balanced approach to your tasks and keeping your health in mind will better serve you than pushing ahead blindly. Take care of yourself, even if you're full of energy and raring to go."," A case of the ""blahs"" may have you in a funk today. While mentally you're able to see your mission, your body or emotions might simply not feel like doing everything that needs to be done. Instead of throwing it all out the window, commit to doing at least a portion of your plans. Even if this just means getting coffee with a friend or doing the laundry, don't lose the day to feeling washed out or lazy. You can do this!","You may have a chance to be in charge, even if that's not where you thought you'd be right now. Someone may suddenly step down or have to be elsewhere, leaving an empty space for you to step up. While this sounds like it could be scary, don't shy away from taking this opportunity. Imposter syndrome can create doubt, but odds are, you'll have the chops to take it on without much trouble. Take charge without being afraid to be in command.","Commitment may be knocking on your door. Whether or not you're ready, someone close to you could appear and ask you to become more serious about your relationship with them. Regardless of what type of relationship it is, this might be unexpected, and you don't have to make a snap decision. Just because they're ready to be closer doesn't mean you have to be in the same place. Move at your own pace; you have to feel it from within before you commit.","Solidifying your routine can help you overcome your obstacles. Now is the time to be investing in your future by becoming more serious about your day-to-day activities. If you've been slacking off on any of your good habits, you can begin to pick them back up now, too. Any habits that you start to implement now are more likely to stick. While this may cost you a little extra energy, it's worth it to have a better day tomorrow.","It's time to return a favor, and one that you'll feel good about. Someone who has helped you out in the recent past may need help themselves now, even if they don't ask for it outright. You may simply see them struggling and find the opportunity to step in and be of assistance. Even if you don't see them struggling, if your intuition leads you to pay for someone's coffee or pick up a little extra work to lighten their load, you may find more joy in your day.","Cleaning up your environment can help you create some inner peace and inspire your energy. You may have been dealing with some mental static lately that has been throwing you off, and this could be due to some stagnancy in your home or office area. A little cleaning and organizing will make a big difference. If you want to take it a step further, adding a new plant or decoration that speaks to you can lead you to feel more grounded in your space.","You may feel all over the place currently, despite your best attempts to create a more peaceful schedule. Relax, you don't have to do everything all at once. Although it may feel like people around you keep distracting you from your more important responsibilities, in reality, life is about the journey and not the destination. As long as you're able to keep a consistent pace and not veer too far off course, you can conquer anything that ends up on your plate.","Look to the past today for answers regarding the present. You may feel stumped by an issue that you encounter, but it's likely that you've already conquered this issue previously, in another form. Think back to a time when the advice of someone that you consider to be a mentor saved you from running into trouble. Repurposing this advice can save you from trouble now, too -- you may even want to reach out to this person again if you need a reminder.","When you're trying to make an important decision, it helps to get an outside opinion today. You may be in a headspace where you think it's better to do it all on your own, but while brainstorming with others can be complicated, it will likely lead to a better outcome for you. Other people might have some information that you're not privy to, and this can help to open up your mind and lead you to the answer you've been looking for.","Letting your emotions run wild or allowing laziness to get the best of you can lead to exuberant spending today that you may regret. Try to ground yourself to prevent financial distress. Before you reach for your wallet, ask yourself if that extra expense is really what you want, or if it's more likely to create a financial headache for you in the long run. Don't let a temporary mood cause you to make a long-term mistake."
2021-08-26,"Step forward with courage today! Communicative Mercury trines transformative Pluto at 10:23 am EDT and starts us off with a bang, turning our thoughts toward powerful ambitions and encouraging us to do more with what we have. However, the emotional Moon squaring Pluto can pull us into swirling feelings that threaten to ruin the mood with overabundant intensity. Thankfully, the Moon then sextiles optimistic Jupiter, bringing us back from the brink and reminding us that positivity and emotional strength can carry us almost anywhere.","Fear of missing out might creep in if you spend today watching what others are doing. You could find yourself focused on what the people in your life are working on, or you may try to figure out how they're perceiving your own activities. Remind yourself that no one is able to tell what's truly happening in someone else's mind. You never know -- they could be wishing that they were you! Rather than worrying all day, do what makes you feel happy or fulfilled.","Creativity currently runs through your veins. You may feel more able to solve problems and come up with the right answers to both your own questions and those of others. The only thing that could stand in your way right now is your own fear of messing up. Still, as long as you look at your ideas as just that: ideas that don't have to be perfect on the first try, you can end up with a winner at the end of the day.","Someone else may be projecting their feelings onto you. There's nothing wrong with being empathetic, but regardless of how tied up your emotions are with those of someone else, you're the one who has to live with the consequences of your actions, not them. Tune into your own feelings and ask yourself how you would handle the situation if this person weren't influencing you. Do your best to recognize what's coming from inside your own heart versus what's being pressed into your heart by another.","It's OK to cry if you feel the tears coming on. You may have been holding back more often lately, trying to be strong for the people around you or yourself. This overflow of emotion could be caused by something sad or happy. Whichever it is, you never know when something will tug on your heartstrings, making tears spring to your eyes. This is nothing to be ashamed of! You might even inspire someone else to open up emotionally in their own way.","You could be feeling discouraged by your fears or your past at the moment, but that isn't where you're meant to be. Let the ones who love you lift you up. Reminiscing about good times, hearing what old friends are up to, and making plans for the future can help to raise your spirits. Someone may even have a gift that they've been meaning to give you for a while -- offer them an opportunity and they might do so today!","An internal intelligence is available to you now, making this a good time to trust your gut. Don't spend too much time worrying about what direction to take. Instead, focus on your instincts and let them take you where you need to go. Someone may try to convince you that you're not doing what's right for yourself, but don't let them stop you. When your heart gives you a signal, tune in and listen! It could be much luckier than following any predetermined map.","Slow and steady wins the race. Today's energy can make you yearn to burst ahead, but if you're too eager to sprint forward, you could trip up and find yourself at the very back. Keeping a hold on your impulses and making sure to take things one step at a time will save you from having to go back and redo what you rushed through initially. You'll have so much more energy once you get to the finish line as well!","It's time to forgive your past self and fortify your current one. You currently might be berating yourself over an issue from the past, while that same mistake is likely nowhere to be found in the memories of others. Even if there is someone else who does remember, it's not worth it to let this memory eat up the precious time that you have now. Practice forgiving yourself and promise that you'll do better next time, and you'll be better equipped to take on your future.","You can make impressive strides in your career today. There's no reason to go after anyone else; any attempt to be aggressive could backfire. Even so, an assertive stance behind your own ideas can be a great thing. You might even find yourself in competition with someone else! Luckily, this should be the positive kind of competition, resulting in improvements for everyone. With good reasons behind your arguments, you'll likely be in a more advantageous position tomorrow than you were yesterday.","A new friend who ends up feeling like family could enter your life at any moment. Be open to new people, especially those who have already helped support you in small ways. You may have met them before but forgotten about them, and now they've returned to you. Seeing this person with fresh eyes can remind you of their potential. You never stop making friends in this life unless you choose to, so be willing to expand your circle.","It might feel like you're aging backwards today. Something from your past that makes you feel younger could return, helping to light up an area of your life that's been a bit humdrum lately. Even if you normally have to be the responsible and mature adult in your life, it's OK to let yourself goof off a little and enjoy the freedom that this blast from the past is asking you to indulge in. Sometimes a fresh perspective is all you need!","Let someone else's success encourage you. You may have been falling behind in some way, and now you're unsure how to move forward. Today you can look to someone inspiring, whether they're a celebrity or someone that you know in real life, and learn about what they did in times of uncertainty. Seeing how they felt when they were in a dark place and comparing that to where they are now can encourage you to forge your own path through the fog."
2021-08-27,"What's meant to stay will stay. The sensitive Moon enters steadfast Taurus early this morning, creating harmonious energy that fills our emotions with peace and understanding. The Moon's trine to the confident Sun at 9:19 am EDT helps to marry our inner selves with our outer selves, making it easier to find peace in our current situations, no matter what they are. Something or someone may leave us as the Moon squares constricting Saturn, but with grace, we should be able to let it go.","Someone may disappear from your life today, for better or for worse. They could be moving away or a friendship might drift apart, but either way, it would be best to let bygones be bygones. Whether you find a firm ending or fall prey to a gradual drift, let this person move on and allow your mind to hold space for yourself once they've gone. You don't need to rush to close the void that they've left. In time, fulfillment will come naturally.","Something is driving you toward all that's fresh and new right now, which is a good way to move forward from some difficult memories. There may be someone trying to pull you back into the past with negative gossip about people that you both know or by reminiscing about bad times. Don't let them drag you down! You have opportunities to have fun in the present, so take advantage of them and don't look back at things you can't change.","A personal change might suddenly become noticeable for you now -- you may have recently let go of a metaphorical part of yourself or a literal object that was a large part of your youth. Remember that moving on doesn't mean that you're no longer you. We all grow and change every day; it's simply hard to perceive because it happens so gradually. If you notice that you no longer resonate with an old aspect of yourself, it's OK to let it go.","Overachieving isn't always all it's cracked up to be -- particularly today. You may feel pressured, by yourself or others, to do more than you realistically can in the time that you have available. Be honest with yourself and those around you about what you're truly able to do right now, and set your expectations accordingly. You'll feel better when you plan tasks that you'll actually be able to complete, and those good feelings can carry forth into tomorrow.","You might feel tempted to bend the truth in order to make yourself or someone else seem a little better, but even white lies will reflect poorly on the teller. Be as honest as you can today! If you can't say something kind, you may not want to say anything at all. It's better to hold your tongue than it is to make something up, and others will appreciate your honesty. Plus, the person you're talking to could already know the truth.","Work or other responsibilities could feel extra heavy at the moment, and the same old sights you're used to seeing every day may be getting you down. It might be time for a change of scenery! Breaking out of your routine and spending some time in nature can put the spring back in your step. Even if it's as simple as a trip to the park or a drive through a pretty part of town, find some visual inspiration to chase away any blues.","Start today with something that resonates with you spiritually. This is an excellent time to become a little stricter about how you're spending your day -- directing this discipline toward an artistic or spiritual growth spurt is just the way to go. You could take music lessons, explore meditation tools, or garden and work the soil with your hands. Whatever it is might really help you connect with your inner self. Blend your outer routine with internal freedom for the best results.","A social boost may be coming your way. You might feel like hiding indoors or focusing on work right now, but you could miss out on a really good time if you do so. If friends invite you out or an event poster catches your eye, don't miss the chance to dress up a little and mingle. Life is short! Whether you happen upon an opportunity or purposefully make time for them, it'll likely be good to catch up with friends.","Someone in your group may try to overstep their bounds today, and it could be up to you to make sure that they don’t create cracks or breaks in the parameters that help you feel safe. Even if you usually prefer to make sure that everyone else is getting along and having fun, sometimes at the expense of your own comfort, your happiness is important as well. Do include yourself in your social circle, but don't hesitate to be firm with your boundaries!","You have great potential for success today, but it's very dependent on your ability to know when the fun has to end and responsibility has to kick in. Thankfully, you likely have a good grasp on how to be accountable, but don’t be so hard on yourself that you end up having no fun at all. All work and no play will make for a dull day, and you probably need to recharge your fun batteries right now! Find a balance between dependability and distraction.","People you meet now may see you as more open than you tend to be. While it’s OK to open up to new people in your life if you feel comfortable, you don’t have to share anything that you'd rather keep private. Feel free to ask more questions about them in return. This can help you both tell if you want to continue getting to know one another or not, without either of you having to reveal everything about yourselves.","The past is a recurrent theme for you at the moment. Look back on your old social groups -- friendships that have already stood the test of time are likely worth continuing. This is a great day to get the original gang back together! Catching up with people who have known you for years, whether it's in person or online, could have great benefits for you. Do what you can to ensure that these friendships will continue for many years to come."
2021-08-28,"New beginnings are a beautiful thing. As the sensitive Moon conjuncts revolutionary Uranus at 5:52 am EDT, we see ourselves encouraging the brave and bold choices in our own lives. The Moon's trine to passionate Mars then increases our energy and encourages us to collaborate with like-minded people in invigorating ways. Finally, the Moon's sextile to dreamy Neptune sparks our imaginations, filling us with creativity and optimism. Grab hold of the inspiration that permeates the day and don’t let it go to waste!","A creative solution to some financial problems in your life could be available to you now. If you've been toying with the idea of a new side hustle or fundraising for a cause that's close to your heart, your imagination can truly make things happen if you put yourself to work today. Money is flowing more freely, and the methods that you use to make a little extra cash can be fun as well. It's a win-win.","You may see some unfortunate cruelty today -- perhaps one person is pushing another around or just not being very nice in general -- and this is your chance to speak up for what’s right. Without being abrasive, let them know that it’s not okay to be a bully, and stand with the person who can’t necessarily stand up for themselves. While it may take a little extra bravery to pull this off, it’s worth it in the end.","There's power in creation now. Even if you don’t feel like you’re very artistic, creating something with your hands can help you get your feelings out and improve your peace of mind today. Art doesn’t always have to be a masterpiece -- it can be making a birthday card for a friend, painting a wall a new color, or sprucing up a garden. Whatever will make your day or someone else’s a little more beautiful, do it!","Friends may come calling today, and this is a good time to connect. Even if you haven’t hung out in a while, break out of your comfort zone and see what it’s like being with a few special people who make you laugh. Exploring around the city or roaming through the countryside together can bring you good feelings and long-lasting memories. Someone new may even come along, giving you a chance to make a fresh connection as well.","Keeping yourself focused on old projects can result in something great. Even if you were tempted to lounge the weekend away, a project that you’ve been putting off could also be calling your name. If you really need the rest, then by all means, spend the day how you want to, but if you have extra energy and it’s making you antsy, then it’s best to direct it somewhere positive. Otherwise, you may be tempted to make more dubious decisions.","Getting your body moving can help to inspire you. You may feel like you’re bursting with energy now, and sitting around can cause you to feel anxious. This is because you’re stuck in your head, but getting out of your head through yoga, jogging, or even just stretching can help you to release this nervous tension. Once your blood is flowing and your muscles are loosened up, you'll have more confidence to tackle the rest of your day.","Although you might have been happy with your first attempt at a recent project or plan, it still may have gotten sent back to the drawing board. Now, rather than having to change your work, you could feel like just scrapping what you were working on and giving up. Take a deep breath and try to figure things out piece by piece instead. By analyzing what went wrong and tweaking minor details, you’ll likely be able to salvage much of what you originally had.","Someone in your life could surprise you today. You might have become accustomed to a certain kind of behavior from this person over time, so now you expect them to always treat you that way. However, they could switch things up suddenly and shock you with a change of pace. Whether you enjoy the pace or not, try to at least be open to it. You may realize you like the new version of this person!","Have patience with yourself. You may feel like you’re not quite where you need to be right now, but this is natural when you’re going through a growth spurt in your spiritual journey. You don’t have to achieve everything right away. Instead, try to appreciate the small ways in which you’ve made strides in your life. If you look back even a few months ago, you’ll be able to see the difference between the past you and today's version of you.","Having fun with pals is probably the best way to harness the restless energy you’re feeling. If you try to work tirelessly through the day, you might find that you’re being blocked over and over. This is the universe trying to tell you to take a break and enjoy life with the people who love you. Get in touch with your support system, whether this is family or close friends, and make a point to laugh and play together.","You can find satisfaction right within your own front door today. In fact, venturing too far away from what you know and love may get you turned around. Others could try to push you toward situations that don’t feel right in your gut instinct -- listen to your gut. This doesn’t mean don’t leave your home at all, but try to stick with what's familiar and don’t feel pressured to go beyond your comfort zone if it doesn’t feel right to you."," Communicating your passions can lead to satisfaction and growth now. If there’s someone or something that really matters to you, but you haven’t yet said anything about it yet, now is the time. Tap into your inner confidence when it comes to being honest with others, even if you’re not sure that you can be that courageous. Bravery is a key word for you today, and the people around you will admire your ability to be straightforward."
2021-08-29,"What’s in the dark may come to light today. The emotional Moon's trine to transformational Pluto at 1:50 am EDT draws our more intense feelings to the forefront, making us aware of how powerfully we care. The Moon's square to expansive Jupiter can then cause us to go overboard and be dramatic about how we’re feeling, while her trine to communicative Mercury brings all that we’re thinking out into the open. When the Moon enters playful Gemini midday, then we can finally take things a little less seriously.","Someone may be trying to get some information out of you. You might notice they are asking more questions than normal, even though they are trying to play it cool. Play it cool yourself, and don't let them know everything that this person is trying to get out of you. They may have ulterior motives for trying to figure out what you're up to, so keep your cards close to your chest. Keeping your business a mystery for a little while won't hurt you."," It might be time to take a trip. While you likely can't drop everything and go on a big vacation right now if you weren't already planning one, you can still get out of your comfort zone and try going to a new place that's closer to home. This can be as simple as a little out-of-the-way shop that looks cute or a park you've never ventured to before. Whatever journey sparks your interest and seems fresh and exciting, try it out.","Freshening up your environment could make you feel better right now. You may have been exceptionally busy lately, so your home just hasn't gotten the love and care that you normally show it. Doing a deep cleaning and organizing the untidier parts of your living space can increase your optimism and make you more excited for tomorrow. If you feel up to it, maybe even invite some company to share the fresh and clean atmosphere with you!","Your social life is in for a big boost. You may receive lots of invitations to spend time with friends now, and you'll have to decide where you devote your limited time. If you're having trouble deciding where to go based off of a fear of missing out on the better option, it's easy to make a decision by trusting your intuition. Wherever you feel you'll have the most fun and fulfilling time, that's where you should go.","Opportunities to improve your finances could cross your path today. You may not recognize them if you’re focused on other things in your life, though, so you’ll need to keep a clear head in order to seize these opportunities when they arrive. Don’t shy away from leadership positions or a chance to show someone why you’re the right candidate for their job. If you bring them a good attitude and the right skills, they’ll likely give you a shot.","Half the effort will only lead to half the satisfaction. Even if the only tasks on your to-do list today are the more mundane ones, don’t do them halfway and then say that’s good enough. If you have to go back and redo things later, you might miss out on something that you’re really wanting to do. Not to mention, the more effort you put forth right now, the more someone else may take notice of you. Show people what you’re really made of!","You may have a lot to deal with right now, so don’t be afraid to ask for help. It can be humbling to need help sometimes, especially with things that we feel like we should be able to do on our own, but don’t be hard on yourself if there’s really too much on your plate. There are people willing to lend a hand, and as long as you’re willing to trust them to do a good job, it’s wise to let them step in.","Someone may react emotionally today if you come off as too intense. Especially if your feelings are strong or upset toward a person in your life, the words that you choose to express these feelings might not come out the way that you want. Take it slow and try to rein in your emotions and see how the other person reacts first. The calmer you are in your delivery, the calmer they’ll probably be in their response. You’ll be thankful that you kept it cool.","You’ve likely been working longer and harder than usual lately, which means you could now be ahead on your tasks. If you’re not sure what to do with the extra time on your hands, catching up with someone you care about is one of your best bets. You might be tempted to start other work projects right away, but life is meant for more than that. Go ahead and spend a little time with the people who matter most to you.","It’s time to practice active listening. Even if someone in your life isn't the most interesting person to spend time with, that doesn’t make it OK to brush them off. If you’re sharing company with someone who doesn’t always have something fascinating to say, try to pay attention to what’s going on in their life anyway. They might be lonely and trying to share their life with someone, even if it’s not what you wanted to hear. Being a good listener can make a world of difference."," Fresh ideas are flowing and you might be ready to show everyone what you know. Still, it's important you don't step on someone else’s ideas in the process. Although you may have a lot to talk about and not that much time, make sure that you’re not the only person who has an idea before you interrupt. Your mind is working faster than your eyes and ears today, but letting others have their say will help them to listen to you when your turn comes.","Consistency matters when you’re trying to get where you want to go. You may be wondering why you’re not seeing the results that you wanted to see, but you have to be honest with yourself about where you’ve been consistent and where you’ve been letting things slide. There’s no need to get down on yourself if you haven’t been as focused as you wanted to be, just remind yourself of your goals and what it will take to get there. You can do it!"
2021-08-30,"Compromise requires both sides to agree. Communicative Mercury enters balanced Libra at 1:10 am EDT, generating a powerful desire to make our environment more peaceful and diplomatic for everyone. However, the moody Moon squaring the confident Sun can create a clash of ideas and make compromise more difficult than it sounds on paper. Thankfully, the Moon then trines disciplined Saturn, helping us to be mature and work out our differences. Even if we disagree at first, eventually everyone can work together to create a better world.","Say what you mean today, not what you think will get you what you want. Being dishonest to try to sway the results will not lead you down the best road for your future. Controlling others by controlling the story isn’t healthy -- being honest will be better for everyone in the end. While there's no need to be cruel when someone asks you what you think, you should still tell them the truth about your opinion on the topic.","It’s time to get organized! Giving in to procrastination might be causing you unhealthy stress in your life -- and the more you put off those tasks, the more you’ll have to catch up on tomorrow. Buckle down and do them as soon as possible so that you can actually sit down and relax later. You’ll be able to enjoy yourself more once you’re no longer dreading those chores, and it’ll free up time for some spontaneous fun.","Emotional reactivity can get the best of you at the moment. Someone in your life, very likely a family member, might make a comment that stings. It would be best to decide ahead of time how you’re going to react if someone questions your life choices or even life events that you can’t control. Instead of responding emotionally, remind yourself today that you’re in control of your own actions and you can choose to maintain your composure.","It could be hard to know exactly how you feel right now, and that’s OK. Others might push you to say what’s on your mind, but the words don’t seem to come or you feel like you can’t express your thoughts in the way that you'd like. Be patient with yourself! If you don’t know yet, it’s not a cop-out to say so, it’s just the truth. Those who love you will understand and give you the necessary time to figure it out.","Don’t let yourself get lost in what other people are feeling. Your own self-confidence could be shaken when you hear what those around you are currently thinking, but what rings true for others is not necessarily what works for you. If you’re looking for your emotional security in other people’s lives, you may not find it at all today. Try turning inward to search for your guidance. There’s only one you, and your life path won’t always look like the paths of others.","You may have trouble with authority today. Someone who has power over you or who's important in your life might make a decision that you don’t agree with, which can create issues if you try to push back against it. Ultimately, you may not be able to sway them, but gently looking for a compromise could still help more than flying off the handle would. Be cool, calm, and collected when you try to make change happen from a less powerful position.","It’s all about putting action behind communication for you now. As interactive Mercury moves into your sign, you might find that your mind is working quickly to keep you full of conversation and chatting with everyone that you meet. Make sure that you’re not all talk and no action if you say yes to someone’s request for help -- don’t make promises that you can’t fulfill. Try to keep conversations light and fun and remember, you don’t have to commit to anything today!","The past and the present might meet at any moment today. This could take the form of a past hangout spot, an old friend, or even an ex-lover. However this blast from the past manifests in your life, pay attention to the way it makes you feel and what memories it brings up for you. Whether they’re rosy memories that encourage nostalgia or unpleasant recollections you’d rather not revisit, appreciate the place they had in your life and allow them to move on once more.","What you want to do and what you need to do may not align today. Your responsibilities could take longer or require more steps than you thought, getting in the way of your other plans. Don’t get too frustrated when you have to maneuver around some unexpected work, just shift your focus. It’s best to get any duties out of the way so that they aren't weighing on you later. You’ll likely still have plenty of time to enjoy your plans this evening!","You may have grand expectations for yourself today, but you have a responsibility to your physical form as well. Don’t push yourself too hard without giving your body the fuel that it needs. Make sure that you aren't skipping meals, relying on caffeine, or leaving merely a few hours for yourself to sleep, because you need your rest in order to get the most out of your day. The better you feel, the better you'll perform, so be kind to yourself!","Hyping yourself up will feel so much better than tearing yourself down! Although it may feel like there's no one in your corner today, it won't be helpful to continue agonizing over your mistakes. As long as you’ve learned from the past, there’s no point in continuing to revisit any blunders you made back then. Even if you mess up somehow today, just make sure that you manage to make amends, then move on. Lingering on your regrets will only keep you in that negative headspace.","You may find yourself at the center of a conflict, and how you respond right now matters. People might fight over you or try to force you to choose a side in their argument. The truth is, you don’t have to get involved if it’s mainly between other people. However, if you are intimately a part of this conflict, try to help everyone seek out a compromise to their issues rather than staunchly defending any one side. Diplomacy is your friend!"
2021-08-31,"Success comes when we appreciate positivity and let negativity roll off our shoulders. The sensitive Moon trines friendly Venus early this morning, encouraging good feelings and harmony with those around us. However, when Luna later squares passionate Mars and confusing Neptune, tempers can flare and misunderstandings are likely. We might find it hard to know how to fix what could break if we lose our cool. Fortunately, the Moon trines optimistic Jupiter at 4:48 pm EDT, gifting us more luck and smoothing over any rough edges from earlier.","For every hidden enemy trying to create issues in your life, you also have a supporter at your side, backing you up. Instead of trying to sway the people who already have proven that they’re not there for you, remember to be grateful for the people who appreciate you for who you are right now. Focus on the cheering, not the booing. You can’t make everyone happy, so you might as well spend your energy on your true loved ones!","Work could be more fun than play today, believe it or not. Even if this isn't normally the case, your coworkers might brighten your day and encourage you, while your friends may not have the same positive attitude. It might feel as if things are a little backward right now, but just let yourself enjoy the good energy! Don't think that these blessings aren't truly good just because they're not coming from the expected people or sources. Take your support where you can get it.","Getting some room to breathe could be necessary today. Other people may have been influencing you more than normal, or you simply might be craving your own company after spending a lot of time around large groups. There’s nothing wrong with a little alone time, and sometimes this is the best way to gather your thoughts -- particularly if it feels like your life is spinning out of control. This is a wonderful day to enjoy your favorite hobbies or partake in some meditation.","Someone may present you with a problem that can’t be solved via regular means today. If you keep trying to get through it by doing things the way that you always would, then you’ll likely get stuck going in circles. You know how to think creatively, and your emotional intelligence can help you avoid getting stuck. Use your ingenuity and look off the beaten path to find a smart way around the problem. You'll have much better chances that way.","Sometimes you just need one person who believes in you! You may be in competition with many others right now, or a whole group of people could be leading you to doubt yourself. Whether your confidante is a trusted family member who’s got your back or a close friend who knows you better than anyone else, give them a call and reach out for their comforting words. While true confidence comes from within, it's still nice to hear a kind thought from a loved one.","Your energy may be tenser than normal today, and it could require increased effort to stay calm throughout any annoyances that cross your path. Instead of blowing up at the people who rub you the wrong way, try to avoid causing further friction by keeping your composure. Everything will probably work out in the long run, and you might even end up being applauded for your cool demeanor by someone in charge. Keep calm and carry on!","Worries can creep in and ruin your day if you don't pay attention to your thoughts. These anxieties could come out of nowhere or take the form of long-standing fears that are returning to your mind once more. Whether they’re familiar or unfamiliar, your best option is to push back against these concerns and remind yourself that in reality, the most negative outcome does not have to happen. Conquer your day by keeping your eye on the best possible outcomes!","A person you once knew could be trying to convince you to trust them at the moment, after they already hurt you in the past. You might be tempted to believe them, despite your better judgment, but remember that trust is both important and fragile. They could easily let you down again, putting you in a very uncomfortable position. Be strong and remind yourself what it was like the last time you tried to believe that they had changed.","It may be tempting to stretch the truth today to try and keep up appearances around someone you want to impress. In reality, that wouldn't be the best use of your words or your time. Stay in communication with the people who want to support you or who are relying on you. If you’re not quite up to taking on a new challenge or you're not finished with your last big project, then it’s OK to be honest about that! They’ll likely understand.","Travel might be a little rockier than usual now. Whether you’re just taking your regular commute to work or you’re boarding a plane to go on a foreign excursion, you’re likely to encounter unforeseen delays or frustrations. Even if things appear fine, be extra diligent about your mode of transportation and double check that you have the necessities with you. It's better to be overprepared than underprepared! The more you can expect the unexpected as you get ready, the easier the trip itself will be for you.","A sense of luck shimmers around you at the moment, so if you’ve been wanting to be more spontaneous than usual lately, today is the day to do it. Look for something out of the ordinary, like checking out a restaurant that you keep passing by but never stop inside or visiting a friend that you haven’t seen in a long time. You might even feel like you're generating your own luck right now -- take charge of your fate and seize the day!","Family is at the forefront today. If you’re not close with your family, this could apply to a roommate, a close friend, or others you consider found family. You might be contacted by someone who’s known you for a while, so do what you can to make it a good interaction for both of you! They may be dealing with something difficult -- whether they tell you about it or not -- and it’ll be worth it to try and put a smile on their face."
2021-09-01,"We'll have an extra case of the feels today due to the sensitive Moon's entry into tender Cancer in the early hours of the morning. As the day progresses, a rough square between messenger Mercury and Luna at 7:46 am EDT might have us saying things we don't mean -- but we'll easily smooth any issues over before midday arrives. The day concludes with the radiant Sun's easy and supportive angle to the Moon, making this evening the perfect time for resting and nurturing ourselves with care.","Even if you don't normally wake up thrilled at the prospect of work, it looks as though you'll be singing a different tune by the day's end. That's because pleasant interactions at the office or wherever it is you go to earn your paycheck are possible now. A co-worker or client might be pleased with your recent efforts, and they will go out of their way to verbally express their gratitude. You deserve to bask in this appreciation, so enjoy every second of it.","You're being encouraged to stop and smell the roses today, cherishing as much of the good side of life as possible. It's possible you like to enjoy yourself as a general rule, but it's rare that you're given cosmic permission to take hold of this desire and run with it. Don't let this opportunity to indulge in something that brings you pleasure slip through your fingertips. You can worry about what those around you need or want tomorrow.","You know something good when you see it, so don't let shiny distractions steer you away from the incredible possibilities opening up to you now. Even if a small chance or idea doesn't seem like a big deal right now, it could grow into something much bigger and much more valuable down the line. Think of today as your chance to plant the seed of something new in your life. With time and patience, it might blossom into something wonderful you'll be proud of in the future.","If you normally prefer to keep a lid on things, you'll be pushed in a different direction today. People will be interested in what you have to say, so don't be afraid to express yourself and your feelings in some way. Put pen to paper or talk someone -- or yourself -- up a bit. Don't be afraid to practice by talking into the sky or making a speech to an empty room first. Your words deserve to be heard, so put your message out there.","You're getting a jolt of productivity today but, paradoxically, you must first take your foot off the gas and allow yourself to coast into the slow lane. By letting go and giving your mind the room to meander, you'll veer into different and unexpected directions. Sometimes this is where the best concepts come from, and a fabulous idea could strike like a bolt of lightning. So, go ahead and do some daydreaming -- you could end up dreaming something very valuable into existence.","The day will be a lesson in putting yourself first. While you may not crave the spotlight very often, people will be aiming it in your direction whether you want them to or not. Instead of hiding away, allow others to see what you're capable of. You may already know that what you have to offer is special, but other people need the chance to see it too. If you do, someone with the power to help transform your dreams could come forward to do just that.","The progress you make today could be exceptionally beneficial to you in the long run, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. Instead of focusing your attention on fresh and exciting adventures, spend some time wrapping up old projects and clearing out outstanding items on your to-do list. Clearing out this space grants you the ability to pursue new goals that are calling your attention. It's always easier to add on when you've got the bandwidth to do so.","A curious energy will surround you today, possibly influencing you to ditch your responsibilities and seek out new horizons instead. If you can't venture far out in the physical world, try and become an armchair explorer instead. Learning about different ways of life and pinpointing people -- famous or otherwise -- who are sources of inspiration for you could be equally satisfying. This momentum will give you the push needed to move closer to your dreams, so go ahead and wander.","Don't be shocked if things seem a little stressful at work today. However, rather than being bogged down by this tense energy, look at it through the lens of being offered the chance to spread your wings and soar above it. If any difficulties come your way, don't get intimidated or fearful. Instead, assess the issue carefully. This gives you the ability to come up with a viable solution that a boss or other VIP will be impressed by -- and remember.","Today is all about finding balance for yourself. Fortunately, figuring out a way to strike a balance doesn't have to be boring. The hard work you do so well needs to be counteracted with fun times, with pleasure, with things that bring a smile to your face. What's the point of all the effort you put in if there is never a reward? Remember, whenever there is a period of pushing yourself, there should also be a period of reprieve.","You're going to have lots of options today, perhaps more than you've had in a while -- but not everything presented to you will be as good as gold. In fact, it'll seem like you're being offered more distractions than legitimate options. It will be up to you to decide what to pursue, and you'll have to parse through both the bad and good to get to the great. Use the power of your analytical mind to cut through anything that's just noise.","You could oscillate between wanting to put it all out there and wanting to keep to yourself today, leading to a flurry of confusion about what you should do. Sometimes the best course of action is not to overthink it. Find a way to channel your energy into an artistic endeavor like painting, drawing, or even dancing. The best part about going this direction is that you can proceed without having to decide if you want to stay mum about it or share it with the world."
2021-09-02,"Dreamy Neptune casts a fog over our intentions today as it falls into a rare and difficult opposition with aggressive Mars at 1:43 pm EDT, making it difficult for us to figure out exactly what we want. The emotional Moon in Cancer will square off against pleasant Venus this evening, meaning we might wear our hearts on our sleeves a bit too keenly. Thankfully, things will soften by the end of the day when the Moon forms a gentler angle to Neptune.","A dissonance fills the air between what you feel and what other people are presenting to you. They could bring some enticing opportunities your way, but if you’re too deep in your own emotions, you might let these chances pass you by without taking the time to consider them. If you can find the motivation within yourself, then it would be a good idea to go over them properly, but don’t worry about it if it seems like too much for today.","Today has plenty of fun potential, but just because things are fun doesn’t mean that they're easy. Focusing on yourself and your own needs might be the most important thing at the moment, and that's OK! Even so, people may still clamor for your attention, and you’ll need to decide how much you're willing to give them. You can have the day all to yourself or split it as you please, but either way, you’ll have to make the choice yourself.","You’re going to find that life feels rather like doing the splits today -- while a good stretch feels nice, if you push too hard, you might pull something. One side of life may beckon you with pleasurable pursuits, calling your name like a siren and reminding you of all the fun that could be had, while the other side brings up all of the work that there is to do in the here and now. You can do both, but only if you stay disciplined!","Don’t be too shocked if you wake up feeling rather sensitive -- even more so than usual for you. You’re channeling some very strong energy at the moment! The people in your life, especially those you live with or consider family, might not be on the same wavelength as you. Throughout the day, they could wind up pushing some of your buttons. Take time to yourself as you need it, but keep in mind that people are probably just trying to help.","Life may feel obscure today, slipping through your fingers whenever you try to get a hold on exactly what you want to do. Fortunately, there's nothing inherently wrong with that! Instead of always seizing the reins of life, give yourself permission to hand them off to other people and let them guide your journey for the day. You might find yourself delightfully surprised by where you wind up. A close friend or sibling could introduce you to something new that’s right up your alley.","This looks like a beautiful day to link up with some friends and hang out, and you can expect the planets to support you in this. Your sign isn’t prone to indulging, but thanks to today's easygoing energy, you’ve got permission to enjoy life’s luxuries! It's up to you what that means -- you could splurge on a few little niceties or treat yourself to a wonderful meal. Go ahead and have fun, but remember it will be better with other people around.","A delightful mood is currently moseying through your life, one that can cast a lovely glow over all your activities. This would normally be a wonderful time to slack off and indulge in pleasure, but it looks like you’re going to be more focused on your goals and aspirations rather than smelling the roses. However, professional ambitions don’t have to be boring and unappealing; if you combine your work with things that bring you joy, you can glide through the day with ease.","Life might indeed feel like a dream right now, or like you’re floating along on some gentle amusement park ride. Of course, even the smoothest ride has its exciting portions! You can get the most out of today's energy if you use it to propel your imagination forward and see what wonderful things you can come up with. Look beyond borders, leave your comfort zone, and seek inspiration from different cultures -- it’s not a small world, after all.","Two sides rule over the day, one that's casual and easygoing and a second that's more intense and private. That’s not to say that you can only participate in one or the other -- you can absolutely do both! Still, it might not be the easiest thing to bounce back and forth continuously. Instead, split the day into two parts. Give freely of yourself during one part, then allow your mind to be focused on yourself for the rest of it. You'll be glad you did!","Professional and proactive activities fill today to the brim, but they won't all be dull, unpleasant, or anything like that! As a matter of fact, it looks like you could have an especially lovely time as you focus on today's projects. Know that rolling up your sleeves and getting to work doesn’t have to mean breaking a sweat or burning the midnight oil. Achievements are meant to be enjoyable, particularly at the moment, so go ahead and enjoy them!","Even the most mundane tasks can be turned into something exciting today, if only you take a moment to approach them with a fresh eye and leave your preconceived notions at the door. Perhaps you’re used to doing things in a very specific way -- whether you are or aren't, it would benefit you to try and change up the pattern by doing something different than usual. Look beyond your own backyard for a role model to inspire you to do just that!","A fuzzy, confusing energy muddies any attempt you may make today to get a proper read on the people in your life. It seems that no matter how hard you try, you can’t quite seem to get on the same page. Instead of banging on a locked door, hoping to knock it down, leave well enough alone. It's likely that if you give things a rest and return in a few days, the door will be wide open."
2021-09-03,"Our dreams might be more vivid than usual thanks to a potent opposition between the intuitive Moon and alchemical Pluto. Together, these two planets send us unusually deep and intense feelings, affecting us even in sleep. This energy won't last, however, as the Moon will dance into expressive Leo at 11:58 am EDT, and we'll be eager to shake off the morning doldrums. It's a good day to seek out some fun, because the universe wants us to enjoy this change!","The day dawns on a quiet note. You've got cosmic permission to linger in bed, keeping close to home while you yawn, stretch, and take your time getting ready. Around midday you'll feel a noticeable shift in the air as things pick up the pace, and your energy levels will likely rise as well. Go ahead and ride this wave into a pleasant evening by ending the day doing something that you always enjoy. You deserve it!","The world seems to be already up and running as soon as you open your eyes! It wouldn't be too surprising if your to-do list just keeps getting longer and longer as you go about your day. Thankfully, these busy hours won't continue forever -- you should be able to find time for yourself by this afternoon. Don't hesitate to let your self-care time continue into this evening; you might even want to turn in early and get some extra rest.","This morning arrives with grounded efficiency, encouraging you to assert your place on this material plane and make sure all your ducks are in a row. Put your best foot forward and check your responsibilities off one at a time until you've completed them as best you can. Once the important things are done, you can take it easy for the rest of the day! You'll want to have a clear schedule, as a social opportunity could be coming your way.","Inspiration and confidence are today's most prominent energies. Even if you don't have anywhere specific to be or to dress up for, consider putting on an outfit that really brings you joy anyway. It will do wonders for your spirit to know that you look good and are wearing something you truly love. This confidence will come in handy in the second half of the day, when you might just have some magic to manifest -- whether you expect it or not!",Dreams can offer you vibrancy and color this morning as they linger in your mind. It's a good idea to take a minute from your routine to write down what you remember from your sleep cycle. There could be some potent messages woven throughout those mystical visions. What is the universe trying to tell you? It's okay if you can't figure the meaning out quite yet; you'll probably be able to get to the bottom of it before the day is over.,"No matter how well you slept last night, you might feel a little tired today. Don't push yourself too hard and risk burning out! It's a good idea to hold off on any important meetings or conversations, because you may have a difficult time cutting through the fat and getting to the heart of the problem. Try to highlight alone time for yourself later in the day, because an evening tending to your own thoughts and conserving your energy will do wonders for your spirit.","The day kicks off on a productive note for you. There's little you can't achieve if you put your mind to it, particularly if you use this helpful energy to boost your profession or reputation. That being said, the morning will be the best time to do this. As the day proceeds, the mood will shift into something more casual. Work hard in the AM, then give yourself the PM to kick back in celebration of a job well done.","Daydreamy vibes surround you this morning, making it the kind of day to let your mind wander to more interesting places and concepts. It's fine to take the morning and use it to contemplate the future rather than the present, but you could also try and turn it into a brainstorming session. You never know what million-dollar idea you could come up with! The afternoon may give you the chance to get started implementing any ideas, so let your creativity run wild.","Both sides of the bed might feel like the wrong side when you get up today! It's not fun to have a bit of a chip on your shoulder and feel as though everyone is invading your space. Allow yourself alone time when you need it. Luckily, these feelings won't last. In fact, you might find yourself feeling downright optimistic as the day proceeds. Try exploring some new, expansive horizons to feed your soul and give you all the space you need.","Someone could be trying to get a hold of your attention this morning, be it at the office or in your own home. Take some time to check in with whoever needs it! If you've left a relationship on the backburner, it may be time to reinvest some energy into it. Share your time, but that doesn't mean you have to dedicate your entire day to another person. You can make sure they don't feel neglected and then return to your own personal program.","There's a good chance you'll wake up with a spring in your step, eager to make the most of your morning! Even if you don't consider yourself the most efficient person, the universe encourages you to see this new day as an opportunity to step up and put your best foot forward. Taking care of yourself can do wonders for your appeal to others, so spend time later in the day with someone you cherish -- they'll likely be very impressed with your efforts.","An opportunity to present yourself in front of someone may be coming your way! It's a good idea to spend some extra time in front of the mirror before you leave the house today. While your value is not decided by your looks, putting in a little more effort can make you really stand out from the crowd. Why not show off the best version of yourself possible? Seize the day and show people what you can do with it."
2021-09-04,"A few shockwaves may be felt today as the Moon in dramatic Leo opposes sober Saturn in the early hours of the morning, then squares electric Uranus in the afternoon. Curveballs are likely, so we should do our best to expect the unexpected. Thankfully, we can indulge in a quiet evening when communicator Mercury eases into a soothing trine with Saturn at 9:30 pm EDT, making it easy for us to say what we mean without being pushy or harsh.","You’re probably in a mood to enjoy yourself today, however, you may be faced with a potent reminder that you still have some responsibilities to tend to. If you don’t check off these items in an efficient manner, they could become even bigger problems the longer they wait to be taken care of. Be proactive and tend to your chores early, then you can go have fun freely without the weight of them hanging over you.","Your sign doesn’t tend to rock the boat very much, but today you could surprise even yourself with your reaction to a matter at home or within your family. It's possible a family member or a roommate will pick a fight with you, and you could both be shocked by the strength of your rebuttal. Remember, you are the one responsible for your reactions. Count to ten before speaking to make sure you don’t regret your words.","Something may be coming your way to surprise you -- something you either forgot about long ago or simply never even knew about to begin with. Whether or not this is a return project, it will likely catch your attention and hold on to it tightly. This surprise doesn’t have to be a bad thing at all, especially if you like surprises, but it will probably take up a good part of your day, so be prepared for things to change on a dime.","This is the kind of day when you may need to choose between what you want to do and what you have to do. Although you might start out the day more than ready to roll up your sleeves and get to work, just when you’re hitting your stride, something else could arise that shakes up your concentration and tempts you with much more exciting opportunities. These chances won’t last, so take them if you want them.","You could be up and at ‘em first thing this morning, but while it’s great that you’re so gung-ho about your own plans and ideas, you might want to slow down just a bit and take things more carefully. It's likely that something is going to appear on the horizon today to remind you that other people are counting on you and you can’t just leave them hanging. Take this opportunity to show everyone how reliable you can be.","Although you may be more prone to dealing with the here and now as opposed to giving in to flights of fancy, every once in a while, it wouldn’t hurt if you pull back a bit on the reality checks and let yourself coast along into somewhere less defined, less particular, and a little more carefree. If you break down your structured boundaries, you might discover something really special, so change up your serious approach to life today and see what happens.","The breeze is blowing in different directions today, and trying to figure out which way you’re supposed to be following it might prove to be difficult, especially for your indecisive sign. You are likely in a good mood and ready to enjoy yourself, but at the same time, you feel something holding you back, almost like a rope pulling you off into some more serious territory. There are benefits in both directions, so don’t fight it either way; this contradiction won’t last forever.","Efficiency rules the day, and you’re more than ready to wake up and make today your own. But while you may be raring to go and make a name for yourself, someone could appear out of the woodwork to throw you off course. As much of a pain as this might be, remember that you’re the one who has the right to say no if need be. The real question is: will you want to say no? A yes could be well worth it.","The world is opening up to you, and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find waiting for you in the great wide yonder. Still, whether you're exploring physically or metaphorically, your responsibilities will come calling, reminding you of all the things you need to accomplish in the here and now. Don't feel like you have to give up on your more interesting pursuits, though. The more efficiently you can check off your chore list, the quicker you can get back to adventure.","You tend to do just fine with a buttoned-up style, approaching things as cool as a cucumber, yet some rather intense energy is coming your way today, and it could have you getting a little hot under the collar. The main problem you might have is deciding whether to take these feelings seriously or treat them as a passing fancy. You can indulge and make your whole day about deeper experiences, but life might send some lighthearted moments your way, too, so you get to choose.","You may be ready to spend some time alone today, yet someone is likely to pop up in your life to shake things up, whether you’re in the mood for it or not. This could be a wonderful thing and you might indeed have a lot of fun bouncing around with this person and enjoying life. However, they could just as easily push your buttons with their sudden appearance, so draw boundaries wherever you need them to be.","There’s a pattern and a smooth rhythm to this day that you can sync up with as soon as you open your eyes. Use this efficiency to get you places calmly and quickly, whether to literal appointments or just to the next task on your checklist. Some unexpected news or adjustments might shake up your schedule, so do your best to stay on track, regardless of any odd communications. You’re flying too high for people to bring you down."
2021-09-05,"Our feelings may be felt deeply today, and we’re being invited to express them whole-heartedly. The Moon is in demonstrative Leo and will form a potent opposition to bountiful Jupiter at 10:22 am EDT, giving the morning a few extra sparks. The drama gets reined in this evening, though, when the Moon moves into calm and collected Virgo. Still, our heartstrings might get pulled by a tense square between Venus and Pluto, giving us the urge to wear our hearts on our sleeves, loud and proud.","Your number one goal today should be enjoying yourself. While you are off on your own joyride, however, you might be reminded that your plans would be that much better if you opened them up to other people, rather than just doing as you please. Instead of being a one-person amusement park, think about getting a group together and letting others contribute their ideas. It will be well worth it when the good times start rolling in.","Even if you can’t bring your comforter with you when you get out of bed this morning, you might want to wrap yourself up in some kind of soothing and protective cocoon as you go through the day. Don’t think you need this as a form of defense, however; the world is going to call on you to put yourself front and center, and people won’t be able to see your abilities if you’re hiding them away. It’s okay to care for yourself and also put on a show.","Busy, busy, busy -- there are only so many hours in a day and today it seems like there just aren't enough. Still, you have as many hours as anyone else, and if they can manage to work within such a time frame, then you certainly can, too. Be efficient and get to work first thing, but maintain your trademark flexibility in case a fun opportunity comes in your direction; if you’ve already checked off the important items on your list, then you can pursue it without any reluctance.","You may be put in a situation today that leaves you questioning your own needs. What do you require to feel secure in this world? Trying to figure out the difference between needs and wants can be a little difficult, but this is a supportive time to try to understand where your desires land. Focus on excluding the superfluous and only put energy into the things you truly need right now; life can become much simpler if you do.","It’s a terrific day to pair up with someone and take on the day as a team. There’s an opportunity for you to find perfect symbiosis with someone else, and if the two of you put in your best efforts, you could wind up covering miles together whereas you might only take a few steps if you try by yourself. Go on and show the world just how far you can go when you share the spotlight.","A wonderful development may be in store for you at work or as you go about your day. A new client might appear on your radar when you least expect it, or perhaps someone will go out of their way to help you out on a project, thus making your life that much easier. Whatever happens, you’re sure to enjoy it even if you didn't plan on it, so don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.","You might wake up with nothing all that exciting on your plate, but a fun and uplifting experience may come your way after all. A friend or a whole group of people might call your name to come and play, or perhaps an opportunity for passion will pop up, bringing a dose of magic to your day. Whatever it is, be open to taking things as they come. There’s a lot of positivity on the horizon, and you have every right to enjoy it.","Your sights may be set high now, and while normally that’s no guarantee that you’ll be able to reach that far, today, you have all the drive necessary to go forward and arrive at your desired destination. You could even go further than you originally intended. A family member or feminine friend may give you some extra support, so don’t be afraid to lean on them if you need to rest for a moment; that’s understandable when you’re climbing such big mountains.","Your mind is firing on all cylinders and some brilliant ideas, perspectives, and plans are probably percolating. Today you should take the opportunity to share whatever it is you’ve been thinking about, inviting others to partake of your intellectual feast. Whether you do so in person, in writing, or over social media, tell people your thoughts; they want to hear them, and may be able to help you take those concepts to new levels in return.","Your sign knows how to make money better than most, and that very grounded nature of yours is going to come in handy today, as you have an opportunity to take your earnings and amplify them to an impressive degree. It probably won’t be a very traditional approach, but if you step outside of your usual lane, you may be pleasantly impressed with where you end up. Some very lucrative ideas are just waiting for you to find them.","You'll want to be especially careful now not to enter into any partnership or contract without carefully reading the proposition before you, fine print and all. While offers might come your way that look good at the start, they could turn out to be anything but that down the road. You can prevent any potential headaches or snafus by taking extra time right now to be diligent in your approach to projects. If you make a point to do exactly that, then future you will be very grateful.","It’s a good day to have an epiphany, preferably one regarding your own behavior. No matter how developed you might be, there is always room for improvement. You can greatly improve yourself right now by identifying some old, unhelpful patterns and doing your best to begin changing your ways. You don’t need to overhaul your life overnight, but if you’ve been carrying on any toxic behaviors, now is the time to start turning over a new leaf."
2021-09-06,"The universe invites us to transform for the better today, thanks to four major planetary events! Warrior Mars will boost our drive as he harmoniously trines Pluto in the morning. Afterward, romantic Venus forms the same aspect to expansive Jupiter, casting a lovely mood over the day. These energies will be locked in with the elegant New Moon in Virgo at 8:52 pm EDT, which is followed by a final trine between the Sun and Uranus, giving us the urge to shock everyone -- even ourselves.","The energies today are excellent for taking stock of how far you've come and thinking about any transformations you've gone through this year so far. As much as you may have accomplished, there could also be some resolutions or goals that are still sitting on the backburner. There's no shame in having fallen off the bandwagon in regards to fixing or changing your life, but if you have, now is a great time to hop back on!","Today marks the start of a wonderful period of opportunity and manifestation for you. Look around your life and ask yourself, ""What do I really want?"" Don't worry about pleasing others or asking for something reasonable or mundane -- you get to make a wish that is all about you. Right now, you've got cosmic permission to be a little bit selfish. Close your eyes and visualize your ideal outcome. The more you believe, the greater the chances of your wish coming true!","Change is in the air for you, Gemini. A strong surge of energy is being focused on your home sector today, and it's inspiring you to take a fresh approach to your own four walls. This could be as small as deciding said walls need a new coat of paint, all the way up to realizing that it's time to start searching for a new home base altogether. Whatever it is, don't be afraid to dive in and get to work!","You and your ideas are highlighted today as the beautiful New Moon highlights your communication sector. Do you have a message you'd like to share with people? If you've been sitting on some kind of written work -- be it a speech, a novel, or even a social media post -- you could soon be invited to say your piece. Even if you don't, this time will likely be very busy, so stay organized and get ready for your calendar to start filling up.","A chance to actualize your money and material goals is being presented to you right now. Whether you're financially secure and happy about it or you're in the market for a whole new revenue stream, today you can impact your financial life for the better. Look for ways to improve your earnings, perhaps by ferreting out fresh income opportunities or by learning how to make your money work harder for you. You could also research investment possibilities and other ways to create passive income.","You are gifted with your own personal New Year today as the gorgeous New Moon happens in your sign! If 2021 hasn't been all you were hoping it would be, you're getting a second chance to start anew with a clean slate and set some intentions for yourself. Think about the changes you would like to see in your life and start taking the steps to manifest those changes. It's your time to shine, so let your light radiate from within.","In the present moment, you might find yourself continually looking back at something in your past. It's not wise to spend too much time gazing into the rearview mirror of life, not when you should be focused on the future, but there could be something specific trying to grab your attention. If some kind of baggage in your history continues bugging you, it's a sign you need to deal with it once and for all. When you clear out old issues, new gifts can come your way!","Reaching out to others could be amply rewarded at the moment. Your sign tends to be known for being quite happy on your own and relishing your privacy. Of course, that doesn't mean you want to be alone all the time; you have your part to play in the world just as much as anyone else. No person is an island! You'll get more out of life right now if you do your share as part of a community or a group rather than shying away from others.","It doesn't matter if you've got your eye on world domination or just on the corner office, you're receiving a huge rush of cosmic energy to establish your deepest desires on the professional front, whether you're working today or not. If you're happy with your career already, then it might be time to branch out in your current position. On the other hand, if you're looking for ways to improve your professional standing, then prepare for them to come towards you very, very soon.","Your sights are drawn to the horizon now, far beyond any boundaries or other hindrances. There is a bountiful New Moon shining a spotlight on your travel sector, showing you just how much of the world is waiting for you to come and discover it. You don't have to book your tickets for any future trips right now, but you can still start planning out some places you'd like to visit. Perhaps your next trip to lands unknown will arrive sooner than you realize.","Today is all about the nuances of life, the deeper meanings and hidden things which don't always get proper attention. They aren't the easiest things to deal with -- often touching on subjects like the undercurrents of relationships, the things you owe to others, or the debts they owe to you. It might not sound like a happy-go-lucky time, and it probably isn't. Still, this is a valuable chance to transform power structures in your life, so steel yourself to dig deep!","A potential partner could be coming your way in the immediate future to help you get through life. While you can accomplish a lot on your own, you don't have to! This person could be a romantic connection, a professional partner, or a good friend. Whatever they are to you, you two can stand on equal ground with each other and balance out your weaknesses with their strengths, and vice versa. You'll be able to move more mountains together than apart."
2021-09-07,"The planets are bringing us with them as they move at a quick pace today, so buckle up and get ready to speed into the future. The clarifying Moon in Virgo trines alchemical Pluto in the early afternoon, making it easy to see past any confusion. She'll then form an exact conjunction with driven Mars at 3:24 pm EDT, giving us the drive to go after what we want. This energy will continue into the evening, until the Moon moves into easygoing Libra around midnight and the mood softens.","Proving yourself on the job shouldn't be too difficult with the help of the universe on your side. The Moon and influential Pluto are conspiring in your work sectors, pushing you to roll up your sleeves and get down to business. You can ride this wave all the way into a powerful performance -- one that might leave a client or a coworker more than a little impressed with you. Finish your workday strong, then kick back and relax in the evening. You earned it!","Your view of the world could solidify into something actionable and substantial right now. Do you have a vision of how you want your life to go? Now is a good time to consider your current habits versus the way you'd like things to be in the future. The best way to channel this is through creativity, so start brainstorming a new project that totally reflects your tastes and values. With the inspiration available to you today, it's bound to be something extraordinary.","You may wish to putter around in your home today to avoid the noise of the world. Unfortunately, things beyond your own walls could pop up at any moment, so be sure to take some time to center yourself before gearing up and going out to deal with whatever arises. Don't forget to check in with yourself and your general state -- if there are any parts of you that need some extra love, allow them (and yourself!) to rest as necessary. You’ll feel worlds better.","Today's energies could sweep you off your feet and carry you further than you ever anticipated going. There are plenty of things to enjoy -- the issue is finding the time to get to all of them! Someone could block your path when you least expect it, making you swerve away from your planned route in order to accomplish everything in front of you. If you need to, gather your courage and forge a new path to success for your current activities.","With the Moon highlighting your money sector today, you’ve got your nose to the ground and may be ready to sniff out some new source of revenue, or at least find a way to increase your current value. Thanks to supportive vibrations from powerful Pluto, someone at your current job could offer you this opportunity. If you do receive support from them, don’t forget to show your gratitude! People who know their help is appreciated will be more likely to assist in the future.","Ample occasions for you to shine under the spotlight could be coming your way. While you may normally prefer to be more of a wallflower, you might be surprised by how keen you are to take center stage right now. Don't let anxiety stop you from showing people what you’ve got. If you’ve been working on an important project behind the scenes, then this could be a great day for your big reveal -- even if you hadn't planned to do so beforehand. Let the universe inspire you!","Although you may feel more emotional than usual today, that doesn’t have to be something negative. Alone time can be very healthy, so check out from the usual rat race and find yourself a spot in the slow lane. It's OK to move at your own pace and ignore any distractions or annoyances from others. A family event or domestic matter might pop up as well, giving you all the more reason to take it slow or stay home entirely.","Someone could say or do something to jog your memory today, taking you on an unexpected detour down memory lane. Let this energy wash over you. Consider reaching out to some friends and spending the day catching up with one another. Reminiscing about old times and finding out what you have all been up to lately might be just what you need. An important message or bit of information may be revealed to you, so keep your ears and eyes open.","An enticing potential purchase might catch your fancy today, making your eyes go wide with both desire for the item and shock at its price tag. While it may be expensive, you can likely afford it if you take the time to be reasonable and organized with your finances. That in mind, don't make this effort unless you truly want to purchase it. It would be a waste of your time and energy if you spent ages trying to save up for something that you'll quickly grow bored with.","It’s important to stick to your guns, but it's also important to be flexible, particularly right now. Everyone needs room to grow and allow their beliefs to change with time and experience, and you're no exception. Today you might be inspired to alter your opinion of something, even if you don’t necessarily want to at first. Do your best to allow yourself to be open to the possibility of a better option -- you never know what good could come of it.","Something might be tickling the back of your brain at the moment, and trying to grab hold of it and figure out just what this message is may be quite difficult. It could be regarding some very intense matters in your mind, so don’t be scared to do a deep dive into your own psyche. Taking the time that you need to excavate your inner world could lead to some unexpected treasures that benefit you for a long time to come.","Relationships of all kinds are being highlighted today, and you may come to realize that some of your relationships have gotten out of balance. Do you like the position you currently occupy in your social circle? If you decide that your equilibrium could benefit from some TLC, then go ahead and do what you can to get your friendships back to baseline. You might be amazed at how much that increases your overall quality of life!"
2021-09-08,"There’s a pleasant mood in the air as the sensitive Moon sails through Libra, encouraging us to find balance in our lives. A midday beam from hardworking Saturn will remind us of our responsibilities, but the energy is harmonious enough that we should be able to roll up our sleeves without feeling put-out. When the Moon conjuncts Mercury at 9:01 pm EDT, relationships come to the fore, making it a good evening to link up with someone and get to the bottom of matters at hand.","People could be eager to get your attention today, so be prepared for the peanut gallery to start chatting you up. A fantastic offer might come your way in all this -- perhaps in the form of a contract or offer that you’d be a fool to ignore, or maybe a friend invites you out to join others for some fun evening events. Whatever offers do show up, be sure to give them your full attention, because they’ll likely be worth your time.","It’s going to be a busy day for you at work or as you go about your daily routine. A coworker or client might bring a new project your way, or perhaps you finally put the finishing touches on something you’ve been chipping away at for a while. This is a great day to seek out new work as well, so if you’re looking for a change, start browsing for a job that is more in line with what you want.","This could be one of the most positive days you’ve experienced in ages, so go ahead and take center stage if the opportunity arises. Passion and creativity are especially highlighted or you, so think about the things that bring you joy and make them a priority, whatever they might be. Whether it’s a person, a hobby, or something else entirely, if it makes your heart beat faster, then chase after it today -- that's where the rewards lie.","Something is brewing under your own roof right now, something that is going to take up a good amount of time and attention. Perhaps it’s time to start some home renovations or a redecorating project, or on a more lighthearted note, maybe you just decide to host a few friends for the evening at your humble abode. Try and control the focus of the day and you could have a truly lovely time without even leaving your own front door.","Something exciting is coming for you, Leo. It’s the kind of day when things seem to be happening even before you wake up, and you blow out of the house and hop right onto the merry-go-round of life. While this might seem a little daunting or tiring, it could actually be a day full of opportunities. Something quite unusual and unexpected could very well happen while you’re out simply running errands and keeping appointments, so be open to a little magic.","You’ve got your eye on your money today, thanks to fortuitous energy happening in your financial sector. You can choose whether to make it, spend it, or even both, but trust that you’ll be tempted to do at least one of these, as either a lucrative opportunity comes your way or something shiny catches your eye. Try not to invest in any fly-by-night options; pick things that will last, be they ways to earn or ways to spend.","You’ve got a special sparkle today as your grace and intuition is lit up by the Moon moving through your sign. You may even be tempted to share the deeper side of yourself now, so if you have a chance to take up center stage, stay away from shallow things and let people hear what you’re really about. They’ll be pleasantly surprised with just how poised and elegant you can be, so show off your serious side; it’s more appealing than you may think.","It’s a good day to get creative and lean into the more expressive side of life. If there's a hobby or talent you enjoy, make a point to carve out some time for it today. You might wind up channeling something truly spectacular that turns around to inspire you for years to come. Just remember that this is about enjoyment and enrichment, not pressure. You don’t need to make a magnum opus, although the stars certainly aren’t stopping you from doing so.","When was the last time you did something for someone else? That’s not to say you’re a selfish person, but if it has been some time since you did something selfless, it would behoove you to flex your charitable muscles and give where you can. Whether this means donating your time through volunteering, giving money toward a good cause, or just helping out a friend, make a point to help someone else today. You’ll be glad you did.","Your boss or some other person in charge might make waves for you today, but these waves could actually be for the best. Besides, if anyone could manage to surf over them without breaking a sweat, it would be you. If you’ve been angling for a promotion, now would be the perfect time to have that conversation. Because you’ll be shining so brightly, people will have a hard time turning you down, no matter what your proposal.","You may be feeling rather serious now, and keen on seeing how far you’ve come in life. You'd be wise to take stock of your beliefs and see if they still hold true to who you are. Chances are you’ve evolved a lot throughout this year, and it’s important to make sure you reflect those changes in your outward expression. Are you actually being the person you believe you currently are? It's time the authentic you shines through.","Someone might call in a debt today, and that could mean you have to pay up -- or perhaps it's you that gets to call in the debt and someone else has to pay up, nicely padding your pocket. Either way, finances are going to be in fine focus, especially those finances you share with someone else, including debt, credit, inheritances, or even taxes. These aren’t always fun matters, but you could still benefit from them running smoothly."
2021-09-09,"Although much of the day should feel easygoing, the afternoon could have us bouncing back and forth between two extremes. The Moon will square off with power-player Pluto at 4:48 pm EDT, making it easy to be a little too sharp in our approach to others. At about the same time, however, the Moon forms a happy trine with optimistic Jupiter, helping us to see the good in everything. Finding equilibrium will ultimately be the key to our success.","This afternoon is probably going to be a bit of a dramatic one, but that doesn’t mean it's all bad. A career matter or obligation could pop up that you have been dreading, and it might seem like more work than you really want to put in right now. Before being daunted by this, call up a friend or even a whole group of supporters and ask their advice; they’ll likely have the right spin to make you see the silver lining of it all.","You are encouraged to aim high today and show everyone just how far you can go. You could feel ready to blast off like a rocket in your desired direction, until someone or something tries to rock your view and make you question whether or not you’re on the right path to begin with. Your best bet is to ignore any naysayers and stick to your guns, and have faith that the end result will be worth it.","It could feel like you have no boundaries at all today -- like you can go as far as your feet or your ideas will carry you. It’s a good thing to let the world in and see how much you can absorb, but while everything is going so lovely, intense feelings may also be lurking. You might find yourself stricken by a sense of jealousy, dampening your happy-go-lucky mood. Choose the high road and that green-eyed monster will soon disappear.","You and a partner might be put through the wringer today. This could be a romantic partner, a good friend, or even a coworker. You two may seem to be vibing one minute, then the next, a wedge is driven between you without even realizing how it happened. Don't let this temporary setback become a longer issue. You can bounce back to a good place with a few kind words, so be the bigger person if any problems do arise.","It’s a busy day for you with lots of little things going on. Unfortunately, while you might have your focus set on sharing enjoyable pastimes with a partner in crime, you also have some responsibilities to attend to. Like it or not, duties will probably come calling in the afternoon. Perhaps a coworker or client comes to you with a sudden problem, and you have to drop everything to deal with it. Roll up your sleeves and do what you must.","Even if you’re normally very good at handling your obligations, today you simply might not want to. Although you could focus on the material or professional aspects of your life and check off any necessary boxes, you probably find no fun in that right now. Take this opportunity to instead slink off and do as you please. Make today about you in whatever way you can, then return to reality in a day or two. Every now and then, life needs to be about joy.","At first everything seems to be going in your favor today, and you’re certainly not going to complain about that. However, come the afternoon, a family member or roommate may bring a problem your way that you’d rather not deal with. It could even be your house itself that starts acting up, needing sudden attention or repairs. Tend to any obligations under your own roof, but still try to get in some fun before the clock strikes midnight.","Today could be rather murky, as though you simply can’t quite figure out what direction you’re heading in. One moment everything seems fine and you’re happy to be ambling about aimlessly, but the next, there may be a jarring change of events that requires your full attention. While this sounds dramatic, you have to decide for yourself just how involved you want to be. Are you going to let in the drama or leave it alone? It’s up to you and only you.","There is no shortage of fun and exciting options for you today, and you might already have a handful of different plans brewing when you wake up this morning. Go forth and enjoy, but don't be surprised if a financial or material issue pops up in the afternoon, requiring your attention. Perhaps there is a last-minute bill you have to pay, or you need to put the finishing touches on a work project when you’d rather kick back. Finish this for your own peace of mind.","You may be chugging along toward your goals now without any intention of stopping. Still, you could accidentally trip yourself up in your aspirations to reach the finish line. It's likely you will receive at least one opportunity to manifest material magic today, yet you could get in your own way if you underestimate the project. Dedicate the proper time and attention to whatever pops up, and do your due diligence. Sloppiness won’t be rewarded under the current cosmic climate, but thankfully, your work tends to be on-point.","Today is wide open to you, and there is no one else who can hold you back if you don’t want them to. However, the one person who can hold you back is you. While you may be interested in exploring new ideas and pushing toward new horizons, something might pop up on your mental radar to give you pause, and perhaps throw a real wrench in the works. If you have to exorcise some personal demons, do it now rather than later so you can continue forward progress.","There’s a strong vibration in the air today that's hard to miss, even if you try to keep your head in the sand. Some sort of disruption may be on the way within your social groups or any organizations you belong to. If you feel like you’re just not gelling with your usual tribe, go ahead and bow out for now. These awkward feelings will dissipate in a few days and you'll be able to see your connections more clearly."
2021-09-10,"We have a chance to dive deep today as the Moon slips into intense Scorpio at 2:05 am EDT, helping us read between the lines. The Moon will square Saturn later in the day, so we might find our desires bump up against our responsibilities, but this won't last forever. When romantic Venus embarks on her annual tour of Scorpio this afternoon, we'll be taken even deeper as she joins the Moon for a vivid, inspired cycle that can bring about major transformations.","Abundance arrives as darling Venus sashays into your sector of shared resources, bringing her bounty to you -- and possibly to someone else in your life as well. This is a wonderful time to focus on money matters, especially major ones. If you’ve been hoping to acquire a loan, now is a good time to look into it. The planet of financial flow wants to line your pockets while she’s here, and she is not the type to do anything half-heartedly. Get ready for a good time!","The partnerships in your life could begin to bring you more joy than they have in some time. If you’ve hit a rough spot with anyone special, an opportunity for it to change for the better is here. You've got lots to look forward to today! Whether it’s personal entanglements or professional partnerships, the people around you will be offering up only the best that they have available. Be sure you do the same and put your best foot forward.","Things are likely to be especially pleasant when it comes to your career at the moment, thanks to Venus entering your daily routine sector today. Coworkers and clients may start bringing solutions your way rather than problems, so you can enjoy a smoother ride than usual throughout the workday. You might even have the time to spruce up your workspace with some personal décor or a plant or two, whether you work from home or elsewhere. Let your personality shine through!","One of the loveliest periods of the year begins for you today as Venus, the planet of love and pleasure, dances into your 5th House of Passion and Creativity. This is prime time for enjoying yourself! You have permission now to wear your heart on your sleeve and do as you please, whatever that might mean to you. Artistic endeavors are able to flourish now as well, so go ahead and show everyone all the beauty you can create.","Home really is where the heart is starting today as beautiful Venus moves into your domestic sector. During this time, you’ve got every reason to indulge your natural eye for style and flair, specifically when it comes to your homestead. That could mean anything from making a few smaller updates to deciding to completely redo your whole house. Look to interior design catalogs or blogs for inspiration that resonates with you, then bring that into your space.","You’re a silver-tongued siren now as elegant Venus dives into your communications sector, giving everything you do a touch of glamour and shine. This is a terrific time for getting out more and seeing what’s going on in your own neighborhood. Try and seek out new things that have a sense of allure. Whether you're taking in a gallery opening or trying cocktails at that new restaurant down the street, life is about to feel much more beautiful.","Monetary blessings are on your horizon as luxury-loving Venus spins into your financial sector, encouraging you to find new ways to make it rain and spend your money. During her time here, you’ll be a total money magnet! Less fortunately, however, you might be tempted to spend as quickly as you can earn. If you’re hoping to save some of your new bounty for later, try to remember to be responsible and give liberally to your savings account.","You become the darling of the zodiac today as charismatic Venus enters your sign! During her three-week visit, you’ll be dripping in charm and appeal. People will have a hard time missing what you’re dealing out. If you’ve been feeling a little lackluster lately, it's now the perfect time to change things up with a new haircut or fashion makeover. You can truly start to embody your ideal look now, and feel like the very best version of you.","Wondrous energy infuses your life at the moment, thanks to beautifying Venus entering your soulful subconscious sector today. Find wherever your rose-colored glasses have been hiding and put them on. It's time to appreciate all the most delightful parts of the world -- especially those that you don’t normally bother to notice. A little voice is telling you to slow down for the time being, and you should listen! Put on the brakes for now; things will pick up again before you know it.","The joy brought by the people who surround you could be the highlight of your life as Venus, the planet of pleasure, enters your social sector today. While she spends time here, you can look forward to having more fun with friends and bounding about like tomorrow will never come.

Start planning out your itinerary, and friends will probably flock to you and your awesome ideas.","The sky is the limit for you as elegant Venus enters your career sector today for her annual three-week visit. During this time, your bosses and other VIPs may be particularly impressed with you and are more likely to notice your hard work! If you’ve been hoping to move up the professional ladder, consider this your green light from the universe. Remember to look your best during this time, because people could call on you to perform at a moment’s notice.","It’s time to look beyond your own backyard for both your inspiration and entertainment. Venus, the planet of beauty, enters your 9th House of Faraway Places today for her annual visit. Let her motivate you to bring something new and different into your life. Use this time to learn about people from different backgrounds and see how they can inspire you to improve the quality of your own life. Don’t let nerves or misunderstandings scare you away from a truly fabulous experience."
2021-09-11,"Optimism lends the day a friendly light as the caring Moon and bright Sun share a supportive sextile at 10:08 am EDT. This theme of positivity will continue as the Moon then forms a harmonious trine with dreamy Neptune, encouraging us to see the magical side of life. Everything is running smoothly! The only caveat is to be careful not to overdo it when the Moon squares bountiful Jupiter in the evening, which makes it all too easy to overestimate ourselves.","Go ahead and ask for what you need today! If any aspect of your life feels like it's slipping beyond your control, then it's OK to lean on others. People will likely be not only understanding, but also willing to help. Don't be concerned that this will make your peers think any less of you -- after all, being honest about your needs is the only way to have them met. Remember that honesty is the best policy and tell people about your situation.","You might have one of the best days you've had in some time -- and you likely won't be alone in this matter. Someone very special could waltz in and pick you up for a last-minute adventure, so don't turn down any invitations that come your way. Any opportunity may lead you somewhere fantastic. Still, there's no need to rest on your laurels waiting for this to happen. Feel free to call up a friend and make this a memorable day for you both!","A messy environment could take a harsh toll on your mental health right now. Take this opportunity to clean up your space and get things organized. If you've been letting dishes stack up in the sink or dirty clothes pile high in your hamper, start tackling your duties one at a time with the diligence of a seasoned general. Roll up your sleeves and get to work, even though it may not be very fun or exciting. You'll feel so much better for it in the end!","This day will probably have you pretty busy, rolling out of bed to immediately get up and at 'em! While this might normally sound rather daunting or even like an absolute headache, you could actually have a fairly pleasant time ahead of you. Even if you aren't expecting something fun to pop up on your radar, the planets could be sending you just that. Take the time to get out and about today, because the chances are good that you'll discover something lovely if you do.","Whether you're sitting on a difficult decision or feeling stuck in general, some brilliant women in your life may have very helpful advice for you now. Whether these are family members, friends, or even professional mentors, they might be sitting on a few nuggets of gold that could help you out more than you realize! You might just learn the perfect way to start moving forward once again, all thanks to some feminine wisdom backing you up.","Your quest for self-awareness is aided by the stars right now, Virgo. Given your usual critical and analytical nature, evaluating yourself probably isn't too difficult for you. It's important to take time and make sure that you're properly expressing yourself and your desires -- and that people are understanding your message! If you feel like you might be sending out mixed signals, then make an effort to clear the air, both for your sake and for the people listening to you.","You could hit on a really wonderful idea now, one that has the ability to greatly improve the material state of your life. What's even better is that you’ll hardly have to try to think of it. The planets are coordinating with each other to send jolts of inspiration your way, one right after the other, and any one of these jolts may turn into a million-dollar idea! Take the roundabout way today; you might end up somewhere fabulous.","Friends will likely be calling for you to join them, so don't hide yourself away today! You might miss out on some fun if you do.

If you've been plugging away at a project, seemingly without reward, then some appreciation for the things you've worked on could finally arrive! Perhaps a VIP will notice all the hard work you've been putting in and formally recognize it. Be grateful, but also be honest and proud -- you've earned these accolades.","Step outside of your usual territory today and make it a point to immerse yourself in something or someone who doesn't fit your normal routine. You might encounter a truly fascinating new idea or way of living that inspires you to adjust your daily life. Even if you're not the biggest fan of change, this could be very much for the better. You don't have to make any drastic upheavals, but doing some small things differently may benefit you a lot.","Major rewards for your efforts are very possible at the moment, thanks to a powerful vibration between the planets in your career sector and your sector of shared finances. You could shoot for the stars and end up receiving a nice lump sum for a job well done, but don't expect this to be a regular occurrence. Whatever money you do encounter will likely be a one-time thing, so keep your wallet open and make sure you don't miss it.","Someone special may open your eyes to a whole new lifestyle today, so take your hands off the steering wheel and let someone else drive for a change. You can learn a lot when you step back and just let life take you places, and you never know how much you might love the destination. You could also build a great relationship with your traveling companion, be they a familial, platonic, or romantic partner. Enjoy the journey!"
2021-09-12,"A brilliant idea might keep us up in the first hours of the morning as the Moon forms a supportive angle to energetic Mars, sending out powerful vibrations when we should be sleeping. The Moon then dips into expansive Sagittarius at 4:34 am EDT, reminding us to look beyond what we already know in order to solve our own issues. This task may become easier in the afternoon when the Moon sextiles karmic Saturn, bringing a helpful solution to any problems we are facing.","A sense of wanderlust may be tugging at you now as you long for adventure and far-off vistas. Even if you can’t hop on a plane to take in some new cultures, make a point to try and spice up your day with something intriguing, preferably something very different than what you’re used to. Try a new restaurant with bold flavors or take in a foreign language film -- broadening your horizons is the ticket to fulfillment today.","It’s a good day to set your eyes on a goal and then do everything you possibly can to get closer to it. There's some extra fire in you right now and no matter what you're chasing after, you could make progress at lightning speed. Your professional life is especially supported in the afternoon, so don't feel like have to wind down as the day goes on -- a second wind could carry you further than you ever expected!","You may have an opportunity to partner up with someone powerful today. Whether this is in a professional, romantic, or friendship situation, what's most important is that the other person be as different from you as possible. Instead of seeking out someone who thinks and acts in similar ways as you, look for a person who has a very different perspective of the world. With your individual skills and ideas combined, you two have far more potential.","You probably made some resolutions back at the start of the year about taking better care of yourself, and today is a good day to gauge how far you’ve come with those. If you’re in tip-top shape then congratulations, but if you’ve fallen off any wagons, then it’s time to hop back on. Whether you start a new exercise program or clean up your eating habits, do something today to start improving the quality of your life -- future you will be grateful.","If anyone can shine on their own, it would be you, Leo! Still, today would be a good day to lean on someone else for support. A friend, lover, or even a coworker could point out something special in you that you’re having trouble seeing in yourself, providing you with emotional bolstering you didn’t know you needed. You could also be this person for someone else, so if you spot someone who might be in need, be their cheerleader.","It's important that you be extra diligent today in crossing your T’s and dotting your I’s. It will be easier than usual to let a mistake or two slip by, so you'll need to be even more focused and meticulous than you already are. A job well done could receive praise and people will be impressed with your efforts, so don’t give them any reason to feel otherwise. Sometimes just a little more work can mean a lot more rewards.","How you present yourself makes a big difference when you have something to say. Communication and expression are highlighted for you today, and when you're handed the microphone, either literally or metaphorically, it will be important that your message syncs up with your identity. Speaking earnestly from the heart will be more appreciated than flowery but empty words, so don’t try and pull the wool over anyone’s eyes, including your own. Your truth is more interesting than any creative exaggerations.","Your foundations are coming into focus today, giving you a chance to level things out and fill in any cracks you may notice. Look around your life for any weak spots or places that make you feel insecure. Once you’ve identified them, develop a game plan as to how you can best strengthen these weaknesses, and turn them into pros rather than cons. A family member could help you come up with the right approach, so feel free to ask for advice.","Some interesting information could come your way today, and you would be wise to heed the message because it may be rather important. It's likely this news will come to you from a close friend or sibling, but whatever it is, it will be worth some serious thought. Serious isn’t a bad thing, however -- you can probably use this information to your benefit, you just have to take a moment to think how to best utilize it to your advantage.","You have a lot of support today if you roll up your sleeves and get to work. What's even better is you can make a lot of progress without much effort on your part. Before you dig in, try sitting quietly and getting into a meditative state, then applying that energy to your projects and chores. You can move mountains when you work smarter and not harder, and you'll impress everyone with your abilities along the way.","You might find yourself feeling a bit more serious than usual today. You’ve grown a lot lately, perhaps becoming more adept at showing up for yourself in the world, and that hasn’t always been the easiest thing -- growth is rarely painless. That being said, recognize your growth and be proud of it. You deserve praise for the efforts you've made, so take some time today to appreciate all you’ve done for yourself and how far you’ve come.","A guardian angel could have their eye on you today, so don’t be shocked if things seem to go your way without much effort. You have support from the universe in all that you do now, and even if you can't see it, you can probably feel it. If you have a wish or a hope you keep close to your heart, go ahead and put some belief behind it today; that belief could help propel it into reality."
2021-09-13,"It’s an eventful day for all of us as the changeable Moon bounds through active Sagittarius. We may be forced to make some adjustments when the Moon forms a tense square to the powerful Sun at 4:39 pm EST, but even those plans might fall through the cracks as the Moon then squares foggy Neptune, making it difficult to gain clarity. Thankfully, we can look forward to the evening when Luna's sextile to bountiful Jupiter promises us an opportunity to enjoy ourselves.","Sometimes it’s difficult to tell the difference between making actual strides and just spinning your wheels. Just when you think you're getting somewhere, you may stop to check your progress today and realize you haven't made it that far at all. It’s no fun when you seem to be just barely treading water, but you’ll do well to remember this is only temporary. Things will likely seem clearer in a day or two, so hold off on making any judgments for the time being.","Things could seem rather heavy today, as though you’re moving in concentric circles, unable to hop out of a funk. The best way to remove yourself from this spiraling energy is to clock out from your responsibilities and get together with some friends for a nice meal or other casual encounter. If you really don’t have the time, at least try to make plans for a future date; even a little bit of contact can do wonders for your spirit.","Someone could take the wind out of your sails today, or at the very least, they might attempt to do just that. Chances are you’ve been aiming high lately, and perhaps a particular person isn’t being very supportive because they see your progress as undermining their own experience. Realize that their drama isn’t your drama, but your boundaries are your boundaries. If this person is projecting or making mountains out of molehills, then take a step back and draw a line in the sand.","Even if you’re on a track today, with a goal in mind, all of a sudden something could come along to distract you from whatever it is you’re supposed to be doing. Normally this might be a rather unpleasant thing, but right now you might as well let this distraction take you as far away as possible. There’s probably something interesting just waiting for you to come find it, so be open to seeing what’s out there -- chances are, it’ll be something fabulous.","You’ll probably be happiest today doing your thing out in the open where people can see you, so don’t go hiding your light behind any clouds. You have a lot to share and people will be glad to take it in. Still, don’t be shocked if something rather intense comes your way to make you second guess yourself in the second half of the day. You would be wise to not let it affect you because it’s likely only a figment of your imagination.","Someone might leave you hanging today, and even if you don’t normally put much stock in this person, them dropping the ball could be a bigger disappointment to you. There’s nothing wrong with taking it a bit roughly, but try to gauge whether it really is the person’s fault, or a fault of circumstances -- in certain situations, it does make a difference. Try to be fair in your assessment, and if the person is at fault, then be judicious, but if they aren’t, then be lenient.","You could be bouncing around today, happy as a clam, until your responsibilities send a glaring reminder your way. This storm cloud doesn’t have to ruin your day, though -- try and assess whether these responsibilities really need to be tended to at the moment. Procrastination isn’t normally the best way to go about things, but if your chores or work can wait another day or two, then don’t let them ruin your flow. You can get back to work tomorrow.","There’s a line to be drawn today between having fun and focusing on your material obligations. However, the problem with lines is that they can easily change. It might be all too tempting to keep moving the marker, inch by inch, as you find yourself getting wrapped up in something much more entertaining than whatever practical plans you had for today. Try to find a balance between having fun and getting things done, and be forgiving of yourself.","You could be affected in more sensitive ways than usual today, so don't be surprised if you find yourself feeling raw and exposed. The important thing is to tend to your needs in this situation and not push yourself beyond your own barriers. Someone who shares your home space might muck things up a bit, pushing your buttons in various ways, so take time to yourself as you need it. Your strongest supporters will respect your need for space.","You’re normally right on top of your game, Capricorn, but today you might find yourself rather unsure of the rules as you navigate life. There’s a foggy energy in the air and this could make it difficult for you to figure out what you want to do with yourself and how to interact with other people. It might be best to take a step back from others for the time being, but if you can’t avoid people altogether, be extra empathetic with everyone, including yourself.","People want you to come out and play today, but just when you’re ready to head out the door for some fun, another matter -- probably a financial matter -- could rear its head and throw a wrench in your plans. Perhaps there’s a last-minute bill you forgot to pay or a reminder that you’ve been spending too much lately and need to rein things in a bit. Try to tackle this issue right away so you can still enjoy some fun but frugal time with friends.","At first things could go swimmingly with your work, as you have no difficulty tuning in to the efficient energy of the day. However, right as you're trucking along, you could hit the brakes and simply not feel like putting in any more effort. Although daydreaming might be a more pleasant use of your time, try and finish strong and hold off on throwing in the towel. Your mind will really be able to soar once it's free from the day's responsibilities."
2021-09-14,"A bewildering fog obscures much of our lives today as the radiant Sun forms its yearly opposition to mystical Neptune. That being said, the impressionable Moon will help us gain some traction once she dips into focused Capricorn at 7:43 am EDT, adding a more grounding energy to the day. Go-getter Mars then zooms into harmonious Libra in the evening for a six-week stay, helping us bring a necessary balance back into our lives and our relationships.","Your relationships take center stage now as your ruling planet, red-hot Mars, enters your partnership sector until the end of October. Starting today, people -- especially your plus-ones -- are going to be playing a larger role in your life than they may have in some time. This could bring pleasure your way, but it could just as easily shove some stressful situations into your orbit. It can't all be dynamic duos and power-player partners! Try to maintain your equilibrium regardless of those around you.","Your career may start heating up today as energizer Mars zooms into your work sector, impacting the pace of your daily life for the next two months. Things are likely to pick up on the job front, but you can look forward to higher energy levels to match this increased pace. If you can't burn off all that verve and vigor while on the clock, then try signing up for a new workout class. Choose something soothing that will help you destress after any long days.","You're entering a wonderful period at the moment with Mars, the action planet, moving into your passion and creativity sector for the first time in over a year. Starting today, life is going to bring lots of exciting and fun opportunities toward you! Get ready to engage with the world in actively positive ways. Go ahead and take up the spotlight for a bit; you could discover your own fifteen minutes of fame -- or perhaps even longer.","Intense cosmic energy can be found under your own roof today, and continuing for the next couple months as Mars travels through your domestic sector. Perhaps you'll decide it's finally time to move or to make other major changes to your living arrangements, like getting started on any renovation projects you've been contemplating for a while. A family member or roommate might push your buttons more than normal, so try to preserve space for yourself within the walls of your home.","The volume on the soundtrack of your life is turned up today with energetic Mars jumping into your information sector until the end of October. You're probably going to be especially busy beginning now, with a lot of different things going on. Do your best to be as organized as you can in order to stay on top of everything. A sibling or close friend might ask for more attention than normal right now as well. Perhaps they could assist with your hectic circumstances!","It's time to turn your attention to your money! Active Mars jumps into your financial sector today, where he'll stay until late October. You'll be motivated to earn more during this time -- but also tempted to spend more. Make sure you know how you make your cash and what you do with it. Being thrifty could be difficult, as lots of shiny (and expensive) objects may catch your eye. If you want to save, you'll have to be extra diligent about putting money away regularly.","You've got a full tank of gas and the need for speed today, Libra! It's time to rev your engine and blast off from the starting line as Mars enters your sign for the first time in nearly two years. This opens a window for you to chase after whatever you want in life. There's a lot of energy available to you, so try to use it in productive and progressive ways. Don't be afraid to go for the gold!","A much slower -- yet also more inspired -- phase of your life begins right now as energetic Mars enters your sleepy subconscious sector. During this time, you might find you have trouble getting appropriate rest, so consider using today to work a daily nap into your routine. The good news is, this cycle can also make you feel very creative! If you've got an artistic side, then this is the perfect time to let it out to play.","Your social life might take off today as fiery Mars jets into your friendship sector, where he'll be hanging out until the end of October. You may have been focusing a lot of your energy on your career as of late, but now it's time to reorient your attention to those around you. Start checking in with people and seeing anything you missed in their lives. If you need to be in charge of getting the band back together, then so be it!","A boost from the universe arrives today to drive you forward as red warrior Mars enters your career sector. This energy might feel like chugging rocket fuel, helping you lift yourself to the place you deserve to be. If professional matters have stalled as of late, this transit can blast the roadblocks away and open up a new path before you. You could be in an amazing new position by the time Mars moves on again. Take advantage of this and get to work!","Your horizons are about to become much broader. Mars, the planet of initiative and energy, dives into your travel sector today, and lands far, far away will be calling your name! If you can't leave town, then a staycation in a different part of your area could do wonders for shaking things up in a good way. There are even options to adventure at home as well -- you can always be an armchair explorer by opening a book on an entirely new subject.","Life could feel rather intense for the foreseeable future, thanks to passionate Mars entering your sector of intimacy and shared resources today. This part of your chart deals with a lot of hot-button issues -- things like taxes and inheritances, or even a very personal bond between you and someone else. With hard work and effort, you could see some real, positive results when it comes to breaking down walls and baring your soul to a close confidante."
2021-09-15,"Stagnant situations are stirred up as the receptive Moon forms an easy angle with rebellious Uranus at 8:31 am EDT, encouraging us to think outside of the box and escape any ruts we might be in. We should think before we speak, especially in the afternoon when talkative Mercury reaches out to the emotional Moon with some complicated energy that makes it easy to say unintentionally hurtful things. Thankfully, hopeful Neptune's trine to the Moon can rescue us this evening and soothe any bruised egos.","Ingenuity could spark in your mind today, inspiring you to look to a new road for success. Whether you've been aiming for the same goal for some time now or are bouncing from task to task, a little bit of creativity can take you further than you might expect. Try a new approach to work today by bringing something unusual and different to your normal routine. Don't let this opportunity pass you by just because it doesn’t look like you expected it to!","You probably aren't one to shake the boat very often, but today you're being encouraged to show people a different side of yourself. Let everyone hear about your ideas, beliefs, or any of the myriad thoughts and opinions that make you unique. If simply sharing your ideas doesn't feel like enough, consider shaking things up by throwing yourself into a fresh environment to learn something new and exciting. Cooking classes or art shows could be great places to enrich your mind.","A few shocks may jolt your system today, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. It is, however, very likely to be surprising. As you float along at your own pace, anything could careen out of left field to make a play for your attention. Suddenly you're being pulled into its orbit and carried off to some new experience! You probably won't be able to control whatever happens, but you can still do your best to enjoy the ride.","People may play an important role in your life today -- and a surprising one, as well. Uranus, the planet of the unexpected, is making waves in your social sector, but its current angle to the loving Moon invites positivity into your life, so there's not much to fear. An invitation could wing its way to you at the last minute, or perhaps you'll meet some new people that you totally vibe with. Either way, this is not a day to be anti-social.","You may have slipped into a repetitive pattern lately without even realizing it. If life has begun to feel a little monotonous, then make an effort to step outside your usual schedule today and do something different. Some new physical activity would make a good place to start changing up your routine. Even if you aren't feeling bored, exercise could be great for your overall health. Try out a group class or something outdoors to bring some fresh air into your life!","This could be an incredibly lovely day for you! A pleasant beam from Uranus, the planet of surprise, will align with the emotional Moon in your passionate creativity sector. Your power and energy are homing in on the things that bring joy into your life. You've got cosmic permission to be a little selfish now, so make the decision to spend today doing things that you love. Any responsibilities can wait until later -- it's time to have fun!","A family member or someone else sharing your home could bring something unexpected your way today. Happily, whatever happens will probably be to your advantage rather than anything to fear or hide from. This surprise might have financial strings attached, but the end results could be worth it in a big way! For instance, you could have the opportunity to do some major renovations, like turning an extra bedroom into an office to work from home so you can create more ways to earn.","People may be buzzing about you like flies today. Instead of trying to shoo them away, do your best to attract as many as possible to you. There's a good chance that at least one of them will bring something promising and exciting your way! Remember the idiom about being like honey rather than vinegar. Lay in wait and see what flies into your trap -- you could be quite pleased with whatever or whomever comes your way.","Today is the perfect day to shake up your professional game plan for a fresh start, whether you've been plowing away at the same job for years now or bouncing around to new gigs with relative frequency. A bountiful connection between your work and money sectors is encouraging you to try a new approach to an old problem, or at least to an old way of life. You could really impress people when you show them how ingenious your new solution is!","A nostalgic aura is coloring your thoughts at the moment, inspiring you to look back and recall something you really enjoyed doing as a child. Particularly if you haven't had the time to partake in this activity in a while, try to set aside some time now and do just that. Whether it was a creative pursuit, another form of self-expression, or even just indulging in plenty of daydreaming, allow yourself to relax and feel like a kid again, even if only for one day.","You may try not to let other people's expectations impact you too much in general, given that you likely know yourself better than most. Still, that doesn't mean it's always easy to have such thick skin. Right now, someone, perhaps a family member or roommate, might project a lot of their expectations onto you. It's your job to know where to draw the line between you and them. You only need to take responsibility for your own problems -- leave the rest to the other person!","Regardless of what you had planned for today, life may have something else in store. It would be best to be as flexible as possible, reminding yourself that the more you try to control things, the more difficult it will be. Someone in your social circle might pop up with a plan for you to ride off into the sunset together, and if that sounds appealing, then go for it! Don't sit back and miss this chance for adventure."
2021-09-16,"There's some very potent and powerful energy surrounding us today. Early in the morning, the intuitive Moon forms a harmonious angle with the influential Sun, helping us ease into the day and find solid footing. The Moon's midday move into Aquarius then helps us keep our emotions in check and maintain an analytical frame of mind. Still, the evening could present us with fireworks as the Sun forms a rare trine to alchemical Pluto at 9:53 pm EST, making for a night we may not forget.","You can make waves at work and pursue your way up the professional ladder without much effort today. Just remember that what may seem like not much effort to you could still leave other people choking on your dust. That isn’t to say you shouldn’t try and reach your goals, but do try to make sure you aren’t knocking anyone over in your race to reach the finish line. A job well done doesn’t have to be a job quickly done -- take your time with this one.","Your desires could be especially intense today, so don’t be shocked if you feel a little hot under the collar. There’s a powerful energy affecting the parts of your chart that have to do with passion and play, and this can give you more than adequate energy to chase after whatever gets your blood pumping. People will have a hard time missing you, so try to make sure they see something they like; you can charm just about anyone right now.","A family matter could present itself today, and it probably won’t be a small one. Your sense of security is being rattled by this event, and it might hit you on a rather deep level. It may be your financial security that is shaken, or your emotional security, or even a mix of the two. Although it could feel like the world is pushing your buttons, the best bet is not to avoid this, but to lean into it. The way out is through.","You may feel a lot of intense energy coming at you from other people today, and it is up to you to cut through the fat and get to the heart of the matters and the messages. Some of it may be a lot of hot air, without much substance, so try not to let yourself get bogged down with unnecessary drama. Still, amongst the frivolous interactions, there will also be some important ones, so prepare yourself and put your best foot forward to meet them head-on.","There's money on the table now and you would probably be wise not to leave it sitting there. However, before you reach out and grab it, make sure there aren’t any unappealing strings attached. Someone might offer you something or tip you off about a job, and while it could be quite appealing, it could also be quite a lot of work in the long run. Don’t sign up for something that will turn out to be a headache, even if the money is good.","This could feel like one of the biggest days you’ve experienced in some time. The Sun in your sign is forming a very powerful and very rare alignment with Pluto in your sector of creativity and passion, meaning a chance for romance or even your fifteen minutes of fame could come your way. It's imperative that you don’t hide away today unless you really want to miss out. Chances like this don’t come around often, so grab hold with all your might.","Your emotions could be a bit like the ocean today, changing from smooth to choppy in the blink of an eye. There's a lot of strong energy influencing you right now, and you won’t be able to control it as well as you might like. Therefore, your best bet is to tend to your own emotional and mental well-being. Make time to pamper yourself, doing anything to bring a little comfort and even luxury into your life; you deserve it.","Friends may be eager to spend time with you today, and if you can make room in your schedule, you should absolutely say yes to any incoming invitations. There is a good chance that whatever adventures you embark upon will lead you somewhere fantastic and inspiring, and you probably wouldn't stumble upon these experiences on your own. Even if your phone isn’t ringing off the hook, reach out and see what everyone else is up to -- something you hear about might appeal to you.","You could be feeling undervalued lately, or like you’re not getting your fair share. It’s important that you're adequately compensated for the work you do, and this is a good time to get some changes rolling. If you're seeking a new job altogether, a terrific opportunity could present itself now. Or, if you simply want to earn a bit more at your current gig, the universe is supporting you as you talk with your supervisors about a raise. Productivity is at a premium, so make this moment work for you.","Although there may be some barriers in your life that have been impeding your progress recently, today could offer you the chance to take a wrecking ball to them and make more space for yourself. The universe is handing you the tools you need to improve your life, whatever that might be, so this is no time to feel like you’re not capable. You’re more than capable, Capricorn, so go ahead and show everyone how it’s done.","This is the kind of day when it’s best to let the universe do the steering, because no matter how hard you try to control matters, chances are you won't be able to get a good grip on them. Even though you might want to call the shots, it's more likely you'll feel like you’ve been sidelined for the day, forced to just take it all in. This doesn’t have to be a bad thing -- there's much to learn through observation, so do your best to enjoy the show.","A close friend or partner could make something of a power play today, whether or not you’re expecting it. Perhaps a matter of great importance pops up and you assume it will go smoothly, but it becomes more of a commotion than you anticipated. This may not be a bad thing at all, but it certainly has the potential to take a lot of your attention. Maintain a cool head and you can get through this situation without much fuss."
2021-09-17,"We are caught between a number of ricocheting energies today that could bump us up against some surprising restrictions. The temperamental Moon forms a tense square against desirous Venus just after midnight, brewing some late-night issues. These issues could then lead into the early morning as Venus squares icy Saturn, putting a limit on pleasure so that we can’t seem to reach satisfaction. Unexpected events are in store when the Moon squares rebellious Uranus at 12:45 pm EST, reminding us that, really, we’re just along for the ride.","You probably have some ideas about how you would like to spend your day and which pleasures you would like to pursue, but reality may have a very different idea. Sober Saturn is acting up in your social sector, hitting the pause button on any exciting adventures by forcing you to go along with the group when you might prefer to fly solo. Although this may be tough for your independent self to accept, it's only temporary.","Work is probably going to come first and foremost on your list of priorities today, even if you aren’t the one putting it there. Although you might have your sights set on more pleasurable activities with an intriguing partner, that’s no guarantee of anything. A supervisor or a certain responsibility could require you to put in extra hours, getting in the way of your fun and freedom. A raincheck may be required, but at least you'll have something to look forward to.","It’s important to stand by your beliefs, but today you might find that your beliefs and values come up against someone else’s opinions, and you’ll have to decide just how important it is for you to stick to your guns. If you’re willing to put up a fight and defend your ideals, then more power to you. However, you could also decide the fight simply isn’t worth it and retreat for greener pastures. Do whatever is easiest for you and kinder to your spirit.","Although you may be up for a fun and uplifting experience today, you could also feel as though something or someone is trying to put a damper on your spirits. Pleasure-loving Venus in your enjoyment sector is receiving a cold check from sober Saturn in your intimacy sector, so any attempts at bringing something exciting into your life will probably be extinguished quicker than you would like. Be patient -- this trend is only temporary and good things will come your way again.","An obligation or matter at home might take up all your energy today. Perhaps a family member or roommate decides to cause some drama, or maybe you intend to have a nice, quiet evening at home and it turns out to be anything but. It can be difficult to find perspective when you're thrown into this kind of energy, but it'll help to realize that you aren’t the only one with an opinion at the moment and everyone is just trying to be heard.","You may normally get through life relatively easily by managing people and situations with a resilient and polite outlook. Today, however, no matter how much you try to smooth things over, people just might not be swimming in your direction, and you could end up snapping at someone in the process. Try not to lose your temper, even if someone loses theirs at you. Two wrongs don’t make a right no matter how much you think you can justify it.","An unfortunate truth is that fun often costs money. Today you might have to examine your budget, especially with regards to something that you normally really enjoy throwing money at. Perhaps your pampering manicures or massages are costing you more than you can afford, or maybe you need to start being more serious with how you save. Implement a plan today that aims to balance your spending between the things you need and the things you want.","Even if you feel like you’ve been riding high on a wave lately, today there might be a moment or two that knock you down a peg. Karmic Saturn is interacting in a difficult way with Venus, who is currently in your sign, so her normal gifts and bounty are going to be dimmed for the day. The pleasure cruise will return soon enough, but accept that it’s out to sea for the moment and use this time to rest instead.","Your daydreams can take you places, and it’s perfectly fine to give yourself over to flights of fancy every once in a while. Today, however, unrealistic visions could lead you into rather difficult territory, so be careful about donning those rose-colored glasses. While you think you’re off in some magical wonderland, the world will be moving on without you, and people won’t be thrilled that you’ve decided to sit this one out. Do your best to be accountable to yourself and to others.","This is the kind of day that could bring one limitation after another into your life, making you feel like a pinball, bouncing off everything in sight. It will be hard to ignore all the work and responsibilities you have waiting, because the more you try to avoid them, the louder they will call your name. Your smartest move is to roll up your sleeves and get to work -- you can get back to fun tomorrow without any roadblocks standing in your way.","Try not to trip yourself up today, because it will be easier than usual to stick your foot in your mouth or make an awkward move when you’re trying to impress someone. Stodgy Saturn in your self-expression sector will bump up against Venus in your public image sector, so your usual approach won’t likely pay off like it normally does. Hold off on making any important presentations or pitches for a few days, because you’ll be better received under softer skies.","It might feel like there is a wall of glass between you and the rest of the world today -- like no matter how close you try and get to people, there is still something separating you. Instead of letting this get you down or make you feel isolated, try to purposefully do your own thing today, taking time for you and only you. Doing something that broadens your mind could be especially enriching, like taking in a bit of culture or learning something new on your own time."
2021-09-18,"Our thoughts are active as the day begins with the receptive Moon spinning through free-thinking Aquarius and forming a harmonious trine to mental Mercury. Shortly after, the Moon aligns at the same degree as expansive Jupiter, encouraging us to dream big. We can use this energy to inspire us throughout the day, then let our thoughts turn fantastical when the Moon slips into dreamy Pisces at 4:22 pm EDT, giving a watercolor glow to the world at large.","Friends and mutual acquaintances will likely be the key to your success today, so put out feelers beyond your immediate circle to see what’s percolating in the world. Someone might know of an opportunity or event that has your name all over it, but you won’t hear about it if you don’t ask. Connection is important to everyone, and right now that theme is being underlined for you specifically, making it extra important to reach out. The results will be worth it!","Someone who acts as a gatekeeper could decide to allow you new access today, giving you the key to something special you’ve been hoping to know more fully for some time now. Try not to appear too eager when they let you inside, but once you’re there, you’ve got cosmic permission to see how far you can go. A social opportunity may present itself in the evening, so work hard during the day but then relax! You've earned it.","A special spark in the air is encouraging you to break down the barriers you normally build up around yourself, brush yourself off, and seek out broader horizons. The less familiar the territory feels, the more promising the rewards will be, so step outside your comfort zone, even for a little while -- it can do wonders for your spirit. A chance to wow people on a professional level could also come before nightfall, so it’s a good idea to keep up appearances.","A cocoon-like feeling may wrap around you today, helping you transform into something even stronger and more beautiful than you were before. There's powerful energy traveling your way that could have you wanting to keep out of the spotlight and spend time behind locked doors, perhaps by yourself or with someone special. Keep your wings folded securely around you during the day to protect your inner self from prying eyes. Then you can take the evening to fly free under the dreamy Moon.","A contract or offer might be passed in front of you today, and you would be wise to give it a thorough inspection before coming to any judgment. Perhaps this is something that looks great on paper, but in theory will be more work than you realize. On the other hand, maybe it doesn’t seem like it’s up your alley, yet turns out to be just that. It would be easy to make a quick decision, but if you’re flippant, then it may be the wrong one.","Your list of errands may feel erratic, or your workplace might feel more like a zoo than any kind of productive environment today. You can let this get in your way and make things a hassle, or you could decide to just go along with the wild vibes and be something of an animal yourself -- albeit one happily tending to their own work. Don’t worry about what other people are doing! You do you, and perhaps you can have a little bit of fun along the way.","Life brings you something truly lovely every once in a while, and those moments are made lovelier still if you don’t have to work for them. Today might be a day when something beautiful arrives on your doorstep or in your inbox. Even if it isn't the biggest event in the world, sometimes it's the tiniest moments that have the largest impact on our lives. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth! Take this time to cherish any small blessings from the universe.","Someone who's a part of your regular life could be feeling taken for granted at the moment -- even if they don't say anything about it. How have you been showing your loved ones that they matter to you? Make a point today to look around your life and examine those in it and the ways you show them that you care. Be sure to let people know that you value them, in whatever way you choose. It’s the thought that counts.","Life might feel like one thing after another today, so if you were hoping for a bit of peace, you may be disappointed. Your community sector is being energized, so it's likely that a lot is happening as people buzz around you like mosquitos. You may not want to dive in head-first, but dip your toe in the social pond and see what’s up! It could be a bit of harmless fun, but it could also be a big waste of time. Try it out and judge accordingly.","Something big and shiny might catch your eye now, and the urge to open your wallet and recklessly throw money at it is probably very strong. Frankly, there's nothing wrong with that if you’re in a financial position to do so and what you’re buying is worth it. Still, your judgment might not be what it normally is, so try to avoid making snap decisions when it comes to any major purchases. Make sure you really want this before committing to it.","Intense energy could push you to the edge today, Aquarius. You may not usually be one to put yourself out there unnecessarily, but currently, situations can sneak up on you that require your attention! Try not to bite off more than you can chew. This isn’t to say that you won’t be able to handle things, just to recommend that you be prepared on an emotional level. Tend to yourself first -- you can worry about other things tomorrow, or even the day after.","The world could seem to shift from fantasy to reality and back again in the blink of an eye today, which might leave you feeling a bit out of sorts. Be prepared for everything to feel as uncertain as a mirage during the day. The good news is that by the time the evening rolls around, you should start to feel more grounded and like your old self. For now, it would be best to wait for clearer skies before beginning any major projects."
2021-09-19,"The morning starts off on a lovely note for everyone as the soft Moon in Pisces forms an elegant trine to pleasure-loving Venus at 10:26 am EDT, helping us ease into the day's smooth vibrations. This mood will last for a few hours before the Moon moves into a positive sextile to change-maker Uranus in the evening, giving us a shot at some last-minute fun -- especially the kind we might not expect to come our way.","Taking a roundabout way could get you to better places than trying to bolt straight for the finish line, Aries. You tend to set goals for yourself and head directly for them, but right now, a different style of working might offer you a higher chance of success. Let yourself meander and turn over every stone in your path, following inspiration as it strikes. You never know what gleaming nuggets of gold lay underfoot, just waiting for you to take a look.","You might not have been asking for an audience today, but you've likely got one whether you want it or not. A powerful beam of energy is coming toward you, making everything you do shine bright in the eyes of all those around you! Go ahead and put on a bit of a show -- you may wow even yourself in the process. Your accomplishments could be remembered for a long time, making people think highly of you now and in the future.","You might dazzle your peers by showing off your unusual and eccentric side in public today. This isn't the time for playing by the rules! Even if you normally choose to keep your wild ideas to yourself, a fresh approach could net you awesome new rewards -- particularly if you feel like you've been holding back for years and years. People will likely be more willing to compensate you when they see how versatile you are, so get out there and impress everyone.","Something exciting and inspiring may be waiting just outside your door at the moment. Out of all the signs, yours tends to be one that's most satisfied with things that are already near and dear or tried and true. That said, this is a wonderful time to go beyond your regular boundaries and try things outside of your normal routine. Seek out adventure in whatever ways you can -- you might be very glad you did when an unexpected treasure trove pops up on your path.","Powerful energy is crackling in your life right now and you can easily feel the resulting heat. The moody Moon is traveling through your very intense intimacy sector, encouraging you to do some deep bonding with another person, whatever that might mean for you. You aren't likely to be interested in any casual connections, so don't let the day slip away by wasting your time with anyone who doesn't have the stamina to go the emotional distance with you.","A person in your immediate environment could play a major role in your life today, so you would be wise to listen to those you are close with and what they have to say. Their information or ideas may greatly benefit you in the long run. A contract or an offer of some sort might also be on the table -- the kind of thing that you would have never expected until it appeared directly in front of you. Seriously consider the opportunity!","A whirlwind of energy could make getting things done a little chaotic today, but it looks like the kind of whirlwind you'll enjoy, despite the difficulty focusing. Try thinking of it like a fun carnival ride! Your professional life is being supported now, meaning a coworker or client could bring an interesting opportunity to you before this weekend even ends. Consider saying yes to any offers coming your way -- some lovely financial incentives may be attached.","This is a good day to assert your individuality and celebrate the things that make you unique. Chances are you're not exactly one to blend in with the herd as it is, but today specifically, other people are more open to noticing all the best parts of you. Do whatever you can to stand out! An offer from a special someone to get together for a pleasant evening could come down the pipeline, so be ready to go along for the ride.","There's no rush to get out today; in fact, the universe is fully encouraging you to take a personal day within your own walls. Feel free to spend as much time as you like puttering around the house and not going out unless you absolutely have to. Tend to the little details of your life, wrapping up old tasks you might have left half-done and getting organized for the days to come. You can engage with life again tomorrow. Take it easy for now!","Enticing invitations are likely to appear in your inbox at the moment -- people are clamoring for your attention and you won't want to turn them down! You might have to hit the ground running, but if you can keep up your momentum throughout the day, you can go far without too much effort. Check off your responsibilities as quickly as possible so you can slide right into an evening that's more about your pleasures and your passions.","Things can be efficient and productive without being boring right now, and you might find that you actually enjoy rolling up your sleeves and putting your nose to the grindstone. Plus, people could be coming out of the woodwork to support you, so you won't have to do it all by yourself. The planets are doing everything they can to help you make it rain, so you might as well follow along and take this cosmic bounty wherever you can get it!","Chances to link up with friends may show themselves at any moment, so don't go hiding yourself away! People are probably quite eager to see you, and you should try to put yourself front and center. An opportunity for even a fairly routine hangout could turn into something much more exciting when you least expect it, so it's a good idea to accept any and all invites. You could broaden your horizons without even meaning to -- and have fun at the same time."
2021-09-20,"Try as we might, it'll be impossible for us to stick our heads in the sand today and disappear. Messenger Mercury is coming into a beautiful alignment with opportunistic Jupiter, encouraging us to use our voices and speak out. Our intentions can then manifest powerfully when the Full Moon in Pisces occurs at 7:55 pm EST. The Moon will shift into pioneering Aries late at night, setting the stage for future actions and giving us the drive to bring about a new world.","This is a moment of letting go and bringing things to conclusion, Aries. While Full Moons are generally a time of culmination, today's in particular is impacting your sector of endings and completions -- look around your life and see what habits or issues have lingered for too long, and show them the door. You need to clear your plate before you can add something else, so get rid of anything and everything you no longer want. Better things are on the horizon.","You have plenty of things to look forward to today as the Full Moon brings the cosmic focus to your friendships and the social groups you belong to. If you've lost touch with someone and want to rectify that, this is the perfect time to reach out and reconnect; chances are you'll have lots to catch up on. This Moon will also impact your hopes and dreams for the best, so go ahead and make a wish.","Take time to celebrate your accomplishments, because today's Full Moon could send you some sort of career success or reward, and you have every reason to be proud. Projects you've been hammering away at for some time could finally reach an endpoint or be ready for their big reveal, so look for opportunities to make your presentation in the days ahead. There's a road opening up in front of you and it's leading you straight to the top of the mountain.","Even if you don't consider yourself the most adventurous person in the world, it's never a bad time to change up your usual routine and try something a little more exciting. Today's beautiful Full Moon is shining a light on your sector of foreign cultures and boundless horizons, reminding you there is a whole world out there just waiting for you to come and explore it. If you're craving change but aren't able to leave home, open up a book or your computer and be an armchair explorer.","Although you may know that the fabled pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is just a myth, today's Full Moon could show you the way to an unexpected pot of gold, and you might not even have to follow a rainbow to reach it. In fact, the more you try to find it, the more elusive it may become. Instead of searching for a path, trust that the universe will take you to exactly where you need to be.","People could play an important role in your life today as the Full Moon illuminates your partnership sector, impacting everything from romance to business to friendships. You and a particular person might decide to become official, or you might decide it's time to go your own way toward new things. A contract could also come your way during this time, so be sure to read the fine print on any documents or offers that land in front of you.","It's time to get your life in order, Libra. If you've let things fall by the wayside, make a point to remember those resolutions you made at the start of the year and do what you can to get back on track. If it's a healthier diet, paying better attention to your mental health, or just engaging in some routine cardio, then it's a good idea to get started now. You're being encouraged to become the best version of yourself, whoever that might be.","You may be eager to put yourself front and center today, but that doesn't mean you have to shine all by yourself. Rather than making this a day that's all about you and your interests, try and turn the general positivity into a group effort, or at least keep some altruistic urges in mind. How can you help yourself and help others at the same time? There's power in numbers right now, so team up to make a difference.","Your home and family are the prime focus under today's lovely Full Moon happening in your domestic sector. It's a wonderful time to do a bit of redecorating or rearranging to change up the mood in your living space. If you've been considering moving, then that might start to look more viable as well. There's an easygoing vibe under your roof now, and also a healing energy, making any necessary forgiveness work between relatives easier than normal.","Your ideas and thoughts can take you especially far right now as the Full Moon powers up your communication sector and encourages you to speak your mind. This is opening a rather busy portal for you where lots of things are happening, so do your best to keep organized and stay true to your own vision -- people will be paying attention to what you have to say. A dynamic partner could also appear on the scene soon, so keep your eyes peeled.","This is an amazing time to start looking for a new source of income thanks to the Full Moon happening in your money sector. If your wallet is feeling a little light, start searching out new leads because a wonderful opportunity may be waiting for you. If you're already happy with where you earn your paycheck, it might be time to discuss a raise. If you can put together evidence of just how valuable an employee you are, VIPs will have trouble saying otherwise.","There's a lot of energy focused on you today with the beautiful Full Moon occurring in your sign. Hope and positivity are shining down on you and people will be sure to view you in the best light. If you've got any dreams or desires that have been sitting on the backburner, now would be a wonderful time to move them to the high heat. Seeds you planted earlier this year are ready for you to harvest."
2021-09-21,"Today isn’t for the faint of heart. The temperamental Moon in Aries forms a potent opposition to aggressive Mars in relationship-oriented Libra, making it easy for us to let our tempers run away with us. It's important to try and maintain balance in our partnerships, but if we can’t do that, then we should seek out peace and privacy. The good news is, the Moon forms a supportive sextile with sober Saturn at 12:43 pm EST, making it easier for us to see things clearly.","You may feel a strong energy coming at you today from someone in your life who you likely consider a partner, be it a lover, friend, or even a co-worker. Whether this energy will be used for good or for ill is still to be seen -- this person could push your buttons when you’d prefer to keep things copacetic, or, on the flip side, they could unexpectedly bring some very tempting and exciting times your way. One thing's for sure: you'll know you're not alone.","You might have a lot of excess energy today, so it isn’t just your imagination if you wake up with the urge to let loose and shake it off. If you can, start the day with a workout that gets your blood pumping and makes you break a sweat. Then use whatever energy is remaining to do some organizing, whether that’s just doing the laundry or getting your whole life in tip-top shape. Clean up your act and your future self will thank you.","You could have a rather exciting and fun day, or at least the offer is probably on the table, provided you don’t hide yourself away and refuse the opportunity. You are encouraged to express yourself in the most sincere and passionate ways possible right now, so go ahead and be yourself without trepidation. Whether you want to put on a literal show or just spend time dancing around in front of the mirror, make a point to be creative.","Something is coming up from deep within you, Cancer, and it’s pushing you along at a breakneck pace. However, it may not push you all that far, as you find yourself spinning in circles within your own walls. Powerful energies are coming to a boiling point on the home front, making it seem like there is barely enough space wherever you turn. Try to find some privacy or else things could push you a step too far.","It’s a good day to watch your words, because your tongue could be a little sharper than usual right now. You don’t have to keep quiet or avoid people altogether -- if anything, you’re encouraged to reach out to people and touch base, because conversations could be almost electric. Just make sure you don’t send so much electricity that it winds up shocking anyone; there’s a big difference between sharing your ideas and having a one-sided conversation.","Money matters may present themselves for inspection today, and they could put you in both rewarding and stressful positions. Issues of what’s yours versus what’s someone else's may arise, perhaps with a partner or someone with a debt between you. You might find that you owe money and have to pay up, or you could earn a windfall. Use your discretion and analyze every opportunity very carefully. Don’t throw your money away, but don’t miss out on a good opportunity, either.","A powerful blast of energy reaches you today as motivator Mars in your sign is amplified by the beautiful Moon. You could feel like you’ve chugged down half a dozen cups of coffee, even if you stick to only water! Don’t set any limits on yourself right now, because there's a great amount of potential in the air. Whether you have material goals in mind or emotional ones, take the fire that you're feeling and apply it to whatever is important to you.","You could pick up on a mystical vibe today, but mystical doesn’t necessarily mean easy. It’s like there is a major event occurring just off the periphery of your vision, just beyond where you can see it. Still, don't assume this is an event you're currently missing out on, because it's likely more of a preparatory phase. The best solution is to take a step back and try to go wherever the universe wants you to. You’ll be able to travel further if you don’t push.","People might have a lot to say to you today, for better or for worse. That’s all well and good if you’re in a social mood, but if you don’t want any guff from the peanut gallery, then you might want to put on some headphones and take a step back from communication. Mars is stirring up a tense vibration in your social sector, but it’s only temporary, so you can return to people in a day or two. For now, it’s probably best to fly solo.","Set your sights high, because this is the kind of day where you can make a ton of progress without expending a ton of energy. The road in front of you is clearing up and there’s a bounce in your step, so use these advantages while you’ve got them and propel yourself to where you really want to be. A boss or other VIP could also help you along the road to success; accept any assistance along the way!","A fresh breeze is coming to you, asking you to open yourself up to new ideas and new ways of approaching life. It’s easy to get stuck in a rut over time, but now you could get some unexpected opportunities to break down any confining barriers you may have constructed around yourself accidentally. Don't sit back and wait for these limitations to reveal themselves -- do what you can to identify them, then make like a wrecking ball.","You might feel like you're walking a tightrope today as things appear more dramatic than they really are. This intensity could impact you on a very deep level, making you feel more emotional and exposed than usual. Interactions with others might feel especially tense, but do your best to keep calm if a conflicting situation comes your way. If you can maintain your cool, you should be able to walk the line until things settle down."
2021-09-22,"The universe brings our attention to the most important matters in our lives today, as communicator Mercury forms a powerful square to deep-seeking Pluto and makes it impossible to miss the issues at hand. This theme is underscored once the Sun slips into Libra at 3:21 pm EDT, marking the Fall Equinox and the beginning of a new solar cycle. Our thoughts might then run away with us in the evening when the evocative Moon in Aries opposes Mercury, inciting our tempers to flare.","Even if you prefer to handle most things on your own, as many Aries do, you can't deny that there are times when life is easier with someone beside you to offer a helping hand. Regardless of exactly who they are, you may start receiving more support from a person in your life -- perhaps even from someone entirely new or from more than one person! You could find yourself pleasantly surprised by just how many benefits they bring your way.","It may have been easy to be careless about productivity and health lately, but today the universe is signaling that it's time for you to get your life in order! Everyone veers off track from time to time, so just forgive yourself and steer things back in the right direction. Whether you want to fix your sleep schedule, stick to a diet, or work on an exercise routine, you can go far when you put in the effort.","Good news arrives today as the universe encourages you to start living life to the fullest again. If you've been spending your time dealing with everyone else's issues, you can at last return to your own personal program thanks to the radiant Sun dancing into your passion sector. Don't be afraid to put your desires front and center. Focus on the things that bring you the most joy in this world and chase after them without stopping!","You've got permission to hit the snooze button as the life-giving Sun slips into your sector of foundations and family, helping you take things one step at a time. Instead of focusing on other people or starting major projects, take today to simply putter around the house and work on yourself. If you still feel the urge to make a visible difference, then try applying this energy to your home. Some redecorating or small renovations could really freshen things up.","The pace of life is about to pick up, so don't be shocked if stuff is happening today faster and more frequently than it has in a while. The dynamic Sun bounds into your communication sector, bringing fresh opportunities to connect with people. You could find yourself busy with lots of little things in general, so keeping a planner or some sort of calendar is a good idea -- you're going to be filling up that blank space very soon!","You're getting a boost in efficiency today, making this an excellent time to roll up your sleeves and get to work. You're entering an especially lucrative time of year as the Sun leaps into your money sector for a month. If you've been putting in the effort at work, then perhaps it's time to ask for a raise! Another option, if you feel that you aren't getting the financial recognition you deserve, is to start looking for greener pastures. Starting today, both choices could bring you great success.","The stage is set for a very pleasant day! Get ready to rub the sleep out of your eyes and show people what you're all about as the sparkling Sun enters your sign for the next month. If you've been living in the wings, now is the time to step into the spotlight. It's almost like a second New Year for you, so go ahead and set some fresh resolutions for yourself. With hard work, you can achieve them with flying colors.","The volume is getting turned down for you right now, so don't be shocked if you'd rather spend time alone and avoid people for a while. You're entering one of the quietest times of your year, when the mood is focused on detoxing old habits to make room for new things. Those new things aren't here just yet, but they're on the horizon. Take this time to create space for fresh opportunities so that you won't miss out on any of them.","A big change in the solar system today encourages you to step back from work and take some time to check in with people. You've likely been pretty busy manifesting professional gains out in the world, and you could have missed something or accidentally glazed over some important developments while working. It might be necessary to change tack to get your finger on the pulse once again and figure out what's going on. Something big could be waiting for your attention!","You're not the kind of person who would leave your aspirations out in the cold, Capricorn. Today marks a new phase of the year when you get to put all your attention on your goals. The vibrant Sun is entering your career sector for the next month, and it's time to decide what success means to you. If you're in the market for a new job, you could come across a terrific opportunity in the weeks ahead. Keep your eyes open!","The world unfolds like a map as the vivacious Sun dances into your expansion sector, giving you the urge to experience freedom once again. Try to find a way to explore the world on a level that will satisfy you mentally, physically, and spiritually. Although traveling to faraway places may not be an immediate option, you don't have to go far to broaden your mind and enhance the way you experience life. Even the smallest steps keep you moving forward toward fantastical places.","Things may seem very intense for a while, like the cosmic thermostat has gotten cranked up a few notches. Opportunities for growth are coming your way starting today, but it's the kind of growth that creates diamonds, with slow shifts beneath the surface that will eventually result in major change. It's time for you to create a few gems of your own, even if it isn't the most comfortable process. What big adjustments can you make? Start within, then work progressively outward for the best results."
2021-09-23,"The day dawns with an undeniable spark as pleasure-loving Venus forms her annual opposition to rebellious Uranus, making it easy for our feelings to shift suddenly. The results could surprise everyone, even ourselves! The gentle Moon will slip into Taurus at 8:38 am EDT, however, bringing a general calm to the day and reminding us not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Even so, the Moon's square to Saturn this evening might bring some roadblocks that require us to refocus.","Your values are liable to fluctuate today, changing from one moment to the next. Specifically, the way you treat your finances could vary wildly. Where you put your money could have long-term consequences, so remember where you spend it. If you're only thinking about the present when you spend, you might be doing future you a real disservice. If you don't have a rainy-day fund, now is a good time to start saving up to make one.","People could have strong reactions to you today, and these reactions may come at you in unpredictable ways or in ways you don't like. Someone might act rather shockingly and send you for a loop, or perhaps you'll be confounded by someone's behavior in response to something unexpected that you do. Either way, try not to put too many expectations on any one person in particular; it's too big a weight for anyone to carry right now.","You might feel like you know exactly what you're about and where you're going at the moment -- that is, until things start to cloud over. What was once a clear path may suddenly be covered with shifting shadows, but while this might look daunting and bewildering, the strangeness is only temporary. The road ahead will start to look more appealing soon enough. Use this time to rest! You'll be able to hit the trails again under the clearer light on the horizon.","Finding a balance between your plans and those of other people could be somewhat difficult today. You've probably got a million things to do -- most of which seem quite appealing. Still, someone or something may appear on the scene when you least expect it to whisk you away to some other adventure. It might be best to put your immediate plans on the back burner and accept that they can wait while you follow the herd on this particular day.","Hanging out around the house and spending as much time as possible in your pajamas probably sounds lovely today. There may be lots of smaller tasks you'd like to work on right now. While that would be nice and calm, something on the work front could require your attention when you least expect it and force you to trade your bathrobe for business attire. A VIP of some sort might call on you to perform at the last minute, so try to look your best.","Something or someone from far away could send a shockwave or two your way seemingly at random, so be prepared for a few changes on the horizon. A person with a background very different than your own may play a part in your life, even if only temporarily. They could do a lot to open up your view of the world -- possibly even changing it on a fundamental level. Don't turn away from any opportunities today, they're coming for a reason!","Issues involving money could present themselves today thanks to some tense energy coming from unpredictable Uranus in your sector of shared resources. Someone might call in a debt that you need to pay, or maybe it'll be the other way around, with you playing the role of the collector. A potential windfall may come your way -- but it could just as easily leave you, so do your best to hold your wallet tight and don't let every penny roll away.","It'll be nearly impossible for others to miss you and all your allure right now, Scorpio. However, whether you get the reaction you want or something else entirely is a whole other matter. With all these eyes on you, people might have quite a bit to say! It's good to listen to them while still taking their words with a grain of salt, because there's no guarantee that they're correct in their assessments. Remember that you know yourself better than anyone else does.","Life might seem like a dreamland today, which could be good and bad. You may love following any white rabbit that passes by ... at least until reality comes calling for your attention. A matter at the office or some other important appointment could pop up seemingly out of nowhere, or maybe because you simply blanked on it and now it's demanding your attention. Try to aim your focus where it's needed and you can return to Wonderland once your chores are complete.","You might have your whole day planned early, with plenty of activities that allow you to link up with friends for some fun. However, you may have a change of heart just as you're ready to get the party started. A complicated energy brought on by rebellious Uranus could provoke you to act out when you least expect it, so give yourself permission to do your own thing today. You can reconnect with people in a few days under less confusing skies.","Foundations could be thrown off today as your family sector is shaken up by unpredictable Uranus. You could be gunning your way up the professional ladder and poised for success when suddenly, something swoops into your life, distracting you from reaching up for the next rung. This might involve some unexpected dealings with a relative or another home-related matter. Matters of home improvement, whether they involve a situation or a person, may take precedence over everything else right now.","This could be a very busy day for you, so pick up the pace and get with the program! There's a lot of activity in store and some interesting interactions that you won't want to miss, making it imperative that you don't hide your head in the sand. Any experience you have today could lead to a greater opportunity, so get out and explore. You may not even have to go far; a nugget of gold could be waiting right down the street."
2021-09-24,"We can begin the day by smelling the roses along the garden path of life as the sensitive Moon sails through pleasure-loving Taurus. Things will get a bit shaken up mid-day, however, when combustible Uranus aligns with the Moon at 12:56 pm EDT, giving us the urge to break out of our routine. Emotional matters might pull at our heartstrings in the afternoon thanks to a complicated angle from Venus, but those feelings will be fleeting, and a night of creature comforts is encouraged.","This is a good day to change up your approach regarding your finances. The intuitive Moon is aligning with rebellious Uranus in your money sector, so if there has ever been a time to attempt a new hand at tried-and-true matters, this would be it. A unique idea or opportunity may appear on the scene when you least expect it, and it could be a very valuable opportunity. Partners can also be especially helpful now, even if you feel like you can do it all on your own!","You might feel a strong urge to break out and show the world just how different you are -- or at least how different you can be. Revolutionary Uranus and the impressionable Moon are forming a rare alignment in your sign today, so don’t be shocked if you decide to reach for a bottle of hair dye or book an appointment at a tattoo parlor. Just be sure you actually want to make a change and you aren’t just riding a temporary wave of enthusiasm.","You could feel a little bit off today, leaving you scratching your head as you try to figure out what's going on. There is a lot of action happening off in the wings where you can’t see it right now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use it to your advantage. The veil between reality and fantasy is extremely thin, so do your best to zone out and try to touch base with the other side. Interesting messages may be waiting...","This isn’t the kind of day to spend by yourself, so reach out and meet up with some of your favorite people. Just a few phone calls will do the trick if you can’t get together physically. Even if you don’t make the effort, chances are people will be seeking your attention when you least expect it, so keep yourself open to the sudden developments. Life could take you to some very exciting places alongside some very exciting people.","Brace for impact today on the professional front. Thanks to a rare alignment between surprise-a-minute Uranus and the emotional Moon in your career sector, something major could occur at work, and it may come completely out of the blue. You can't control what happens, but you can control how you react to it. Lead with your best foot forward, because people will be watching and a little delicate juggling right now could totally wow people down the line.","Your belief system may be under reconstruction these days. Thanks to revolutionary Uranus moving through your philosophical sector, you might be changing the ways you connect with your higher self and commune with the world around you. While this is a longer phase, these soul-searching vibrations are amped up today specifically as the introspective Moon aligns with Uranus. It may be time to start exploring some new perspectives and incorporating those into your life for the better.","Be careful about biting off more than you can chew right now. A combustible alignment between the temperamental Moon and surprising Uranus in your intimacy sector could bring up a matter involving you, someone else, and some shared property between you. This may be literal property or a more emotional circumstance, but either way, it's something that involves dual ownership. If you don’t want to go to extreme lengths, then play it safe until the skies clear up.","Your relationships are subject to major change today, specifically those relationships that focus on just you and one other person. This isn’t exclusively romantic, it's anyone you have an equal relationship with -- it could be a close friend or coworker, as long as you are on the same footing. This person could bring some very unexpected news your way, or they might behave in a manner that completely throws you off. To keep an even keel, make a little space between you and others for now.","Your workplace might be a minefield today, so tread carefully and keep an eye out for any saboteurs who are hanging out where you can’t see them. An intense alignment overhead is impacting your work sector, and if there has ever been a day when a client might push your buttons or a boss might get on your case for no reason, this could well be it. Calmer skies are on the horizon, so breathe deep and keep telling yourself this is only temporary.","Although you can accomplish great things, Capricorn, you may often be so focused on the end-product that you miss important parts of the process. Today, instead of worrying about how something is going to turn out when it’s done, try to loosen up and express yourself along the way. Get messy with some arts and crafts and don’t worry about what your creation will look like. Right now, there's more magic in the journey than in the destination.","It might feel like the walls are closing in on you as you have a hard time getting enough space or privacy. Things may feel especially tense at the moment, but try not to blow your lid at anyone, because the last thing you want to do is create a long-term problem over a short-term whim. Take a step back from people if you need to -- you’ll feel better when the planets move on to less volatile places tomorrow.","Watch your words today, because something you say or do could wind up hitting much closer to home than you’d intended. Before you know it, you may be apologizing for something you thought was just fun and light-hearted. It’s all well and good to joke around, but if your jokes carry a bit too much truth to them, you could get yourself into trouble. Err on the safe side right now and save your sharper words for less serious days."
2021-09-25,"We're in for a spark or two today, starting when the stable Taurus Moon forms a potent but positive trine to alchemical Pluto at 9:09 am EDT, kicking off the day on a powerful note. We can harness the best of ourselves as the day progresses thanks to another strengthening trine, this time between energizer Mars and hardworking Saturn. At the end of a big day, the Moon happily zips into chatty Gemini, allowing us to kick back and have a good time.","Today isn’t just about you, but rather you in relation to the important people in your life. It's possible things have become a bit one-sided, whether on your side or theirs. This is the perfect time to see that these roles are balanced out and that everyone is pulling their appropriate weight, while still actually enjoying the connection. Make sure you’re doing your part, and if someone isn’t doing theirs, then it’s alright to gently call them out and improve the situation.","You have a lot of support as you climb the career ladder right now, so don't work against it! A job well done will likely be noticed by a boss or other VIP, and this could translate into a nice raise or a bonus for you. You might rather take it easy, but you can make progress right now without breaking much of a sweat, so go ahead and wow everyone with how much you can achieve.","This is a time to put your own desires at the top of your priority list. Think about what brings you the most fulfillment in the world and focus all your energy on that, even if you have to use some unorthodox means of doing so. Stepping outside of your comfort zone in search of your passions can bring incredible happiness and help you view the world with unclouded eyes, so go ahead and color outside the lines today.","Things could feel rather heavy for you today, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. In fact, the best way to handle this is to dive in and immerse yourself in it. If there are issues you’ve been pushing to the backburner, give them their due attention now and see which ones you can fix and which you might need to outsource. If you leave these things for too long they can turn into bigger problems, so deal with them now and wipe your slate clean.","Positive vibrations are rumbling around you and beautiful energy could come your way from someone in your life -- most likely a friend or a friend of a friend. This is a wonderful day to make up for any lost time between you and someone you've fallen out of touch with, so make a point to connect with them in whatever way you can. Your efforts could be rewarded through both good feelings and good news.","There’s a professional energy to the day, but that doesn’t mean you need to climb every mountain you see or worry that you’re not achieving your goals fast enough. Rather, it’s time to do a check-in and see if those goals are actually waiting for you at the end of the path you’re on. If you look ahead and see they aren’t, then it’s time for a course correction. Take a step back today and get some perspective, then make the necessary moves.","The day starts off on a quiet note for you, so you can probably enjoy taking things slow and not rushing through anything. The mood will pick up come the evening, however, giving you a fresh burst of energy that could inspire you to turn your attention toward your own desires and nothing else. Do something that you know will bring you joy, and don’t worry about what other people might say. Feeling good should be your goal.","As much as you like controlling the direction of things, Scorpio, today you should ease your grip and let the universe take the wheel. There's a potent energy in the air that could impact you in fantastical ways, so instead of trying to push or pull one way or another, give yourself permission to just see how things unfold. You could stumble upon something that you’re not currently aware of, and that something may really benefit you in the long run.","Your world could open up a bit today, which is probably welcome news to your adventurous sign. It's likely you've been feeling boxed in, so look around your life for unusual ways to spread your wings. Whether that means diving into a new subject you’ve never studied before or planning a future trip to a country you’ve always wanted to visit, it’s a wonderful day to take the first steps in a new direction. Give yourself something to look forward to.","The greatest wealth you have is your health, and today your wellness practices may be up for review. This is not an order to suddenly change all your ways, rather a cosmic reminder that part of living a long and well-rounded life involves eating healthy foods, getting in regular activity, and having achievable goals. We all wander into more lush territory from time to time, but if you've wandered too far, you have extra support now to get things back in balance.","There’s an exceptional amount of positivity coming at you right now, so while you might have some unavoidable responsibilities looming, you shouldn't let them dictate your day. Instead, you're being encouraged to step into the spotlight and put on a little show to remind people just how capable you are. If you have any creative projects on the backburner, it's time to move them to the heat -- people could be very receptive to what you show them now.","It's been hard to connect with others for some time now, but this is a terrific day to check in with some of the people that you've lost touch with. Whether you've simply been keeping social distance or you have some other reason for dropping out, you don't have to explain yourself. True friends will understand more than you know, and you’ll probably have a lot of laughs once you get on the phone and start catching up. You may even learn some important news!"
2021-09-26,"Today isn't for the faint-hearted, but it shouldn't be too difficult either. The temperamental Moon is going to be especially active, connecting with one planet after another. She first reaches out to the primal Sun in the early hours of the morning, making it easy for us to speak our mind. Next, Luna will trine industrious Saturn at 10:57 am EDT to remind us of our responsibilities before she forms the same angle to ambitious Mars, driving us to plow through any outstanding chores.","People will likely bring lots of interesting information your way today, and you'd be wise to listen up! This information could greatly impact you for the foreseeable future. While you're busy focusing on your own plans, don't forget to touch base with the people in your life -- even the wider net of more casual acquaintances you've built up over the years. Someone may tell you something that's worth its weight in gold, so keep your ears open for any insights.","A path is opening up in front of you today, one that can lead you to the very top of a monetary mountain. You don't have to make the entire climb all at once, but right now is the perfect time to plan your ascent. Start taking stock of all the things you'll need in order to reach your lofty goals. If a VIP or boss offers you a helping hand, you'd be wise to accept it!","A fresh blast of energy could be in store for you, so don't be shocked if your morning cup of coffee seems to pack a little more punch than usual. Use this extra burst to look beyond your routine reality and search out new, inspiring vistas. You could come up with some hot new ideas that really light a fire inside of you! Something special may be waiting for you just beyond the horizon, so get ready to seek it out.","Things could feel a little off right now, like you're missing something obvious or like you have to translate every word you hear from a foreign language before you can truly understand it. While trying to wade through this murky energy might be a little frustrating, you can get to the bottom of what's currently happening by taking your hands off the steering wheel and letting life take over. The universe knows where it's taking you, and it will eventually be for the best.","There's a sociable energy in the air for you today! Rather than encouraging light-hearted hangouts or quick chats, though, this could fuel deep discussions with the people in your life. Don't be afraid to dig into any subjects you might have been a little hesitant to approach on more casual terms. Things don't have to be too serious, but you're able to make major headway on some complicated topics right now -- especially ones that would normally be more of a major headache.","Today is all about finding balance, both inside and out. Look around and consider where you may have been giving more than getting -- or perhaps it's actually the other way around. If the scales of your life seem wildly out of sync, then it's time to start getting on equal footing again. You don't have to jump from one extreme to another or make major changes overnight, but consider taking small steps to reach somewhere that's more in sync with the world.","A creative light shines on you today, tempting you to let out your inner artist. If you don't think of yourself as artistic, then picture this as unleashing your inner child and giving it free rein to do as it pleases. Instead of holding yourself up to unreasonably high expectations, you can be a little bit messy, a little bit wild, and a little bit loud, just for the fun of it! You shouldn't cause a big scene, but asserting your individuality is important.","It's a good day to be productive and get your act together! Whether you've already got all your ducks in a row or are barely managing to keep up appearances, take a minute this morning to center yourself before getting started. Think about how you can work smarter, not harder, and get the results you need to feel like you're on top of the world -- or at least on top of your own life. Find the loose threads so you can weave them together.","You may feel compelled to speak your feelings at the moment, and to do so with thought and intent -- as opposed to throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. A strong alignment occurs across your communication sectors, and while it is positive overall, it's not exactly light-hearted. Make an effort to empathize with everyone you talk to. Something that seems like banter to you could easily push the buttons of someone else, and today will be more fun if people aren't fighting.","The universe is bringing a lot of possibilities your way right now. Even though you'll likely be able to handle them all with a calm and collected approach, you might find that life feels a lot like a game of whack-a-mole in the process. Lots of little disturbances could happen -- the type of things that are fine one at a time, but can get overwhelming when you have to deal with them all at once. Take a deep breath and try to stay cool.","Even if you've got a million things on your to-do list, you may not be terribly interested in checking off those boxes. Why would you be when there are a million more exciting things you could focus on? If you can, allow yourself to take the day off from your responsibilities to have some fun. Most tasks can probably wait until tomorrow, so go ahead and put your desires front and center -- today is all about you!","A little solace and quiet could be the best thing for you at this moment, Pisces. You may be preparing to enter a major period of change and manifestation soon, but it isn't here quite yet. Before it arrives, it would be best to detox some negativity from your environment. Look at your surroundings and ask yourself what no longer serves you. If there are behaviors or relationships you have outgrown, then start weeding them out of your life to make room for the new."
2021-09-27,"Communication can easily tangle into a complex mess today as intellectual Mercury turns retrograde and begins his three-week backstroke through Libra at 1:10 am EDT. Confusion is a current theme, and when the Moon in chatty Gemini squares mystical Neptune in the afternoon, it'll be all too easy to get the wrong idea about anything and everything. Luckily, a bolstering angle from the Moon to expansive Jupiter will remind us of what's possible when we believe and help end the evening on a positive note.","You may encounter a stumbling block when it comes to your relationships today, be they platonic, professional, or romantic. Messenger Mercury is turning retrograde for the next three weeks in your partnership sector, so you'll need to be extra careful about what you mean when communicating with everyone. Unless you're completely certain that someone's giving you a crystal-clear explanation, hold off on jumping to your own conclusions about anything for now. Everything is not as it seems.","Your work life will probably be a little confusing for the next couple of weeks as Mercury turns retrograde in your daily routine sector today, impacting the regular grind that helps you earn your keep. Co-workers or clients might not be as helpful as usual -- they may even throw some wrenches in your plans just when you thought everything was already taken care of. Be sure to check your work multiple times before submitting anything! Still, give everyone some grace for error, including yourself.","Some pitfalls could appear under you as if from nowhere right now. It's all well and good to put yourself out there and let people see what you have to offer, but be wary of bounding into the spotlight without anything prepared. There's no guarantee that your impromptu performance will go off without a hitch. In fact, you'd be wise to rehearse everything before you put it on display. Practice makes perfect -- or at least as close as one can get.","You tend to feel most happy feathering your own nest, Cancer, but that might not be easy as Mercury turns retrograde today for three weeks in your home sector. Matters under your roof will need handling, whether they're regarding your physical home or any people who occupy that space alongside you. Bumping heads could happen at any moment, so give everyone their space. It's OK to retreat from any battles that may occur -- it's unlikely that they will have a clear winner.","You could easily wind up with your foot in your mouth at the moment. While Fire signs like you normally prefer to shoot from the hip, this is a good time to make sure you think before you speak. People may not be on the same page as you as Mercury moves retrograde in your communications sector for three weeks. Hold off on trying to get your point across until you no longer have to jump through hoops just to make yourself heard.","Some unpleasant monetary surprises may lurk in the dark corners of your wallet. No one enjoys financial uncertainty, but you in particular, Virgo, likely hate to have your stability shaken up. In order to avoid any shocks, try to go through your accounts and spending habits to ensure that everything is on the up-and-up. You might need to change your approach right now to get the benefits you want in the long term -- the results could be worth it in a big way!","No matter how firmly your sights are set on your specific goals, the path to them could seem rather winding and obscure right now. Mischievous Mercury turns retrograde in your sign, drawing down a deep fog to hang over the road and make it difficult to notice any unexpected potholes. Walk slowly and test every step before you put your full weight into it. If you don't watch where you're going, it'll be easier than you think to trip and fall.","Your inner voice could be scrambled with static starting today as Mercury turns retrograde in your subconscious sector for the next three weeks. While your intuition may normally be correct, it could easily guide you off course during this confusing time. Keep your focus on the facts and reality in front of you. If you're tempted to try and read between the lines, be careful -- the actual message likely won't be what you think it is.","Conflict can easily manifest among the people in your life at the moment. As Mercury turns retrograde in your social sector, no matter how hard you try to connect over the next few weeks, it may seem like a wall is blocking the path to proper communication with your friends and acquaintances. If you have a serious subject to discuss, consider tabling it for now. People might be much more receptive to your point of view in the future.","You've probably been running up the hill of your professional life for quite some time, and have made good progress! Today, however, you may need to be a bit more cautious when it comes to your speed as Mercury turns retrograde for three weeks in your professional sector. A VIP or boss might be the one to hold up a stop sign and tell you to slow your roll. Try to be flexible in your goals for the time being!","Parts of the world may be opening up to you and life could begin to feel a little more vibrant and hopeful now. Of course, that doesn't mean you can go traipsing off into the great wide yonder without any sort of strategy. Mercury is turning retrograde in your expansion sector today, making it vital to understand that things are shifting and even the best-laid plans will probably require some reworking. You can stretch your wings, but don't fly too far for now.","Not everyone is worth your time, particularly right now. Even though it's valuable to be willing to work hard for the people in your life, sometimes you need time for yourself. You should be careful about bending over backward for just anyone today. Be a little selfish with your own energy -- if someone is truly worth it, then that will become clear on its own. It's better to find that out before you jump through any hoops on their behalf!"
2021-09-28,"Our thoughts could keep us awake as the impressionable Moon trines mental Mercury shortly after midnight, but we might also receive certain messages in our dreams, so we would be wise to write them down first thing in the morning. Once the Moon moves into emotional Cancer at 9:34 am EDT, a softer tone takes over the day. Although there could be a battle between our hearts and our heads when the Moon squares the willful Sun this evening, our hearts will likely win.","A big wave of emotional energy may have you hanging out deep in your feelings today. The Moon is moving through your foundational sector of home and family, so staying in your own space might be a good idea. If you’re in need of company, don't feel like you have to paint the town red, just invite a friend or two over in the evening. They could lend a listening ear and bring some comfort your way.","You may have a hefty list of things to do today -- lots of little errands and obligations to remind you just how busy life can be. But busy isn’t always fun. Instead of getting bogged down by the tasks in front of you, try to team up with a partner or two and tackle them together. Many hands make light work, and you can breeze through everything in less time and with less stress if you don’t have to handle it all on your own.","You could feel like you’re pulled between two extremes today, as the serious side of life is calling your attention, but so is the side with all the fun and exciting experiences you desire. Thankfully, out of all the zodiac signs, yours is the most flexible and best equipped to handle this sort of confusion. Just know that it's temporary and you’ll have an easier lay of the land soon enough. Try to devote the day to work, then the night to fun.","You’ve got an extra push today to go after what you want, but what exactly is that? Trying to figure out how to expend your energy might give you more difficulty than actually doing it, so try to keep yourself from turning in circles. If you could use some guidance, reach out to a family member or a friend you trust. They will probably have some useful words and advice to get you moving in the right direction.","It would be easier to let other people call the shots today, even if you generally prefer to be the one in charge. If you try and guide the chariot yourself, you might find that it's much more difficult than normal, so save yourself the exhaustion and give up the reins as necessary. You can get back to leading the charge in a day or two, but for now, you’ll find more satisfaction -- and less opposition -- if you simply sit back and enjoy the ride.","Make a point to start your work as early as possible and plow through whatever tasks you might have, because you won’t want them hanging over you later in the day. The afternoon and evening are going to offer up some chances to enjoy yourself, perhaps with a few friends in tow, and if you’re still dealing with outstanding chores, you won’t be able to relax as much as you would like. Be efficient first so you can do as you please later on.","Libras are generally pretty good at making people see the best in them, and this talent can take you far. Today, however, it seems that the path in front of you will be a little bit trickier than normal, so do your best to read the room before you make any serious moves. A step in the wrong direction could set you back much further than you would like, but a step in the right direction could take you much further ahead than you’d ever expect.","A little bit of fantasizing never hurt anyone, but a lot of fantasizing can definitely cause a problem if you aren’t careful about going off the deep end. Today you could be tempted to do just that and swim around in some murky waters that, although they might look appealing at first, could bog you down more than is good for you. Try to look at life clearly, and if you can’t hold off on the daydreaming, at least don't lose yourself to it entirely.","Things could feel rather intense today, as though there isn’t enough space for you and all the people you normally allow into your life. If you feel like you’re getting a little claustrophobic, go ahead and hang up the ""do not disturb"" sign and take some private time for yourself. If people aren’t respecting your boundaries, then that says loads about them. You can be more conscious about how you spend your time when you do start to feel social once again.","Putting a lot of effort into your work is admirable, but you may have gotten so focused on your own track lately that you've forgotten about everyone else. Today, someone might come calling your name and begging for your attention, pointing out just how absent you’ve been. Don’t let this be a pain, rather use it as an opportunity to balance out the scales. You can be a great achiever and make people feel welcome at the same time.","You could feel pulled by the world today, with all the exciting things that pique your interest and make you want to learn more about them. Unfortunately, all that may have to sit on the back burner as work or other chores are demanding your attentiveness. You could find yourself so busy that you don’t even have time to do any daydreaming. Try to turn your focus early to the tasks at hand so you can embrace expansion and experience come nightfall.","It’s a beautiful day to enjoy yourself, especially if life has felt a little heavy as of late. You may have been keeping to yourself more while you've been put through the wringer, but today you have permission to do as you please and live out loud, free of any looming issues. Do something for the simple reason that it brings you joy and leave more intense matters for another day -- a little mental vacation will make it easier to deal with them."
2021-09-29,"An unexpected burst of impulsive energy could come our way this morning as the moody Moon squares off against fiery Mars before sunrise. The atmosphere becomes gentler, however, when pleasure-loving Venus forms an easy trine to illusory Neptune at 12:14 pm EDT and helps us see the world through rose-colored glasses. This fantastical energy will be balanced by another trine between the vibrant Sun and karmic Saturn, which could bring some fated moments our way. Pleasure and responsibility go hand in hand right now.","People could bring some truly lovely experiences to you today, so don't shut yourself off from others even if you're feeling rather tired. An invitation or message could be about to arrive, ready to remind you just how much people care about you and enjoy your presence in their lives. Go ahead and say yes to any opportunities! It might not sound like your thing, but you may be pleasantly surprised by how much fun it ends up being.","It's a great day to roll up your sleeves and put in all the effort you can! Some powerful energy is pushing you along at top speed, and it can impact your professional life in the best way possible. If you've been on the lookout for a raise or promotion, this could be the perfect moment to bring it up with your boss or another VIP. A male mentor might have some words of advice as well, so don't be shy to ask.","Power simmers in the universe today, helping you achieve a seemingly impossible wish or pipe dream. It's helping everyone in one way or another, but you can benefit even more than most people. Don't worry too much about reality! Instead, give yourself permission to daydream and focus on whatever bounty you'd like to discover or create. A manifestation exercise, like starting a vision board, can help you get clear on what you want and encourage the universe to bring it to you.","Some sensitive parts of you could feel triggered today, so take things one step at a time! Don't rush into anything until you get a proper lay of the land. This isn't to say there are going to be endless snafus waiting to throw you off balance, but it would be best to keep a careful eye on where you're going. Otherwise, you might wind up diving into territory that's a bit too deep for you.","Being social and getting out there can lead to lots of fun today. Go ahead and call up your friends and see what they're up to! Even if they already have plans, you can probably still tag along for an interesting trip. If there's nothing happening, it might be your turn to take the initiative and make something happen. Whatever you choose to do, you'll have a richer experience if you take on the day with others.","You've got firepower at your fingertips today and you'll be itching to put it to good use! If there are any outstanding projects that require your focus or any daunting matters you've been putting off, now is the perfect time to tackle them because you're even more capable than usual. Don't waste time thinking or worrying about how to do things, just dive right in. You might find that it's much easier to accomplish any tasks than you originally anticipated.","This could be one of the loveliest days you've had in ages! Things may feel like they're coming together by magic. If you have responsibilities and chores calling for your attention, do your best to clear them out of the way first thing. That way, you can instead focus on all the potential bounty in front of you. Spend time chasing your dreams and putting your desires front and center, because they are now well within your reach.","There's energy shimmering just beyond where you can see it, past the periphery of your vision. It's going to be difficult to grasp anything substantial in your hands, so rather than trying to control everything, see if you can let it guide and inspire you. The universe is working in mysterious ways today, and it wants you to take a backseat and follow its lead. You could wind up somewhere truly magical if you remain open to even the smallest chances. Believe in the impossible!","No matter how much you can usually accomplish on your own, burning out is a real danger today. Try picking a partner and making something of yourselves as a team rather than forcing your way through everything alone. Of course you're quite capable, but working solo isn't always the best way! You'll be able to go much further right now by going together, so form a dynamic duo (or even a group) with someone whose skills you trust.","You can achieve a lot today, so set your sights high! A surge of motivating energy is pushing you up the career ladder toward great and lofty heights. That being said, you don't have to make the journey all by yourself. A co-worker or client could help make your ascent that much easier, and you'll have every reason to be grateful to them for it. Many hands make light work, so don't be afraid to share the effort and the success.","Today's focus is on your money and what it can do for you. You may be able to cut through some confusion now to ensure that your money is working for you, as opposed to just sitting in your bank account collecting dust -- or flying back out as soon as you can make it. Look for ways to use your finances more efficiently! If you need to earn a bit extra to make ends meet, keep your eyes open because a wonderful opportunity could present itself today.","Deep feelings permeate through the day in a way that's rather beautiful, free from many intense or difficult emotions. You might find there's more than usual to do around the house, and while you're tending to these chores, you could unearth some old memories or keepsakes hidden away that you had forgotten about. Spend time reminiscing about the past, but stay focused on the good times. There's no need to stir up old negativity if it isn't going to serve you in the present."
2021-09-30,"It's a busy time for all of us as the ever-changing Moon forms nearly half a dozen angles to other planets throughout the day! All this will keep us on our toes, but the Moon's opposition to alchemical Pluto could really set things off. In particular, any power plays may be brought front and center. We're likely to go overboard as tempting Venus squares off with boundless Jupiter, and once the Moon moves into garrulous Leo at 8:53 pm EDT, it'll be even more difficult to rein ourselves in.","On most days you may want to play it fast and loose, but right now you might benefit more from keeping things safe and holding your cards close to your chest. Venus in your intimacy sector will bump into expansive Jupiter, making it feel like an unpleasant spotlight is glaring straight into your eyes. If you don't want to be put on display, it's OK to keep to yourself. You can dazzle the world another day!","People might want a lot from you today, thanks to your ruler Venus making some noise in your relationship sector. That's normally fine, but opportunistic Jupiter is doing his best to refocus your attention on work, so trying to find a balance between personal and professional matters could be more complicated than usual. Try not to shirk your duties! If anyone asking for your time can't accept that you're occupied, then remember that their attitude isn't your problem to take on, it's theirs.","Your daily grind may seem more enjoyable ever since pleasure-loving Venus skipped into your work sector recently, but today it might be a bit hard to focus on the matters in front of you -- even if they're fun matters. Generous Jupiter is in your expansion sector, practically begging for attention, so don't be surprised if you get distracted by every little thing. There are lots of things to learn today, so go ahead and learn! Put off whatever work you can until tomorrow.","It's a beautiful day to grow closer with someone, but try not to move too quickly. Charming Venus in your pleasure sector is encouraging you to wear your heart on your sleeve, yet influential Jupiter in your privacy sector will remind you to take things one step at a time. Let other people take the lead, and if you find yourself encountering some growing pains, feel free to slow down and take it easy for a bit.","Although people might be calling your name to come out and play, you may prefer to stay home and stick to your own program today, rather than adhere to anyone else's. Thankfully, it can be easier to nest cozily under your roof right now without worrying about missing out. If someone loudly demands your attention, then you can check in with them, but don't feel guilty about drawing a line in the sand and setting boundaries where needed.","A variety of random happenings and small events might sound quite enjoyable at the moment. Pleasure-loving Venus is in your 3rd House of Distractions, bringing lots of fun activities your way. Unfortunately, right now she's bumping up against attention-grabbing Jupiter, who's currently in your responsibility sector. As much fun as it might be to throw caution to the wind and do as you please, your chores are probably going to demand your attention. The sooner you get to work, the sooner you'll be done!","This is a good time to make some money moves if you can! Whether or not you think you've got financial work in front of you, go ahead and roll up your sleeves. Your ruling planet, Venus, is bounding through your income sector, and today she'll align with Jupiter, making things feel larger than life. You could hit upon a new and creative way to earn your keep. Since Jupiter wants to enjoy himself wherever he goes, you'll likely enjoy every step of the process as well.","You're already in one of the most enjoyable times of the year as pleasure-loving Venus moves through your sign. Today, though, inflating Jupiter tangles with Venus, increasing your urge to do as you please! You've got permission to make this day all about you, so go ahead and indulge in a few things that bring you total bliss. Anything from a fabulous meal to a little shopping spree could really lift your spirits and make you feel special.","Flexibility is your friend now, so don't worry too much about trying to control the day! As Venus in your subconscious sector rubs up against Jupiter in your communications sector, people could bring lots of options your way, making it almost impossible to decide what to pick. The best solution is to let this buffet of options fully present itself before you start choosing whatever you want. There's no need to focus on reality until you have the full picture.","Good times with great friends could really lift your spirits today! You might want to link up with some allies and see what you can all accomplish together. The only caveat is that Jupiter is acting up in your financial sector, so you could find yourself being a little too free with your wallet right now. There's nothing wrong with spending if it's within your budget, but try not to get so carried away that you foot the bill for everyone else.","Focusing on any of your obligations might be difficult today, thanks to distracting Venus in your career sector squaring enthusiastic Jupiter in your sign. If you've got the day off already, then by all means go enjoy yourself! Even if you do have work to do, try to balance it with some fun so you don't feel totally deprived. Dedicating blocks of time to your own desires will make it easier to plow through whatever less exciting chores await your attention.","Things that are serious or difficult have no place today, so let your fantasies lead you wherever they may! The universe is encouraging you to put on your rose-colored glasses and dream of distant vistas or magical realms -- ones that are very different from what's normally in front of you. If life has been feeling a bit dull lately, try to shake off the doldrums with some creative expression. A bit of painting, writing, or anything else artistic could do wonders for your spirit."
2021-10-01,"The more we have held back on asserting ourselves, the more uncomfortable it might be when we finally do it. Aggressive Mars opposes sensitive Chiron at 9:00 am EDT, which could push us to act no matter who gets hurt. The Moon in Leo, however, can provide a mediating influence by reminding us to pursue joy and honor the value of the individuals in our lives. As inquisitive Mercury pushes withholding Pluto, we may also be challenged to respect others’ boundaries while we seek information.","Someone you are close with may drive you nuts today, as they seem to land on all of your sore spots. Try to remember if there was ever anything fun about this relationship. Guiding the other person toward reconnecting with that pleasure together could help resolve the tension. If they have crossed the line into bullying you, though, you might be better off withdrawing from the situation. You can’t control everything, but you can choose what is worth your time.","People you encounter in your work, whether colleagues or customers, may seem really demanding now. A worldview held by you or by them could push you to see their emergencies as your emergencies, and you might feel bad about yourself if you are not capable of giving them what they want immediately. Do what you can to help them, but be aware that there may be other ways of viewing the situation that hold more compassion for your own limitations.","You may be frustrated because it seems like your friends don’t understand what really matters to you as an individual. However, they might not even be aware this is an issue if you have not told them. You can be more articulate than usual about your concerns today, so take the risk of opening a conversation. Even if your allies are not equipped to handle all of your deepest thoughts, going as far as they are able could help you feel less isolated.","Home may not be a relaxing place for you at this time. If you find yourself having the same fight over and over again, it might be time to look at whether an expenditure you have been resisting would actually make your life easier by removing a source of recurrent conflict. Sometimes the cheapest way to pay is with money. Fiscal responsibility has its place, but you can also honor your resources by using them when you truly need them.","People around you may be fighting about controversial topics like politics and religion. You might be tempted to jump in, but consider whether you are really capable of making the situation any better. Your attempts to mediate could just result in making yourself the center of the drama. Be especially wary of getting into a dispute like this at work, because you might not know the sensitivities of everyone involved. What you hear today, however, can help you clarify your own story internally.","Arguing about money with others could get heated, but make sure you have all the facts before you go off on someone. A piece of the situation that you have forgotten about could turn out to make it less of a problem than you thought. While it might be easy for you to see the financial issue as a threat to your individuality -- or as an opportunity to wield power you are otherwise denied -- try to keep the discussion on topic.","It may sometimes be hard for you to get the courage to assert yourself, but you now have an extra boost from Mars in your sign. You might be disappointed, though, when someone you stand up to acts wounded, like you have really hurt them. Before you get too down on yourself, go to your friends for perspective on whether you did anything wrong. Even if they don’t have the final authority on the subject, they can help you find your own judgment.","A lot of tension may be going on inside you, but you might not be able to put it into words. What's more likely is that you could start to experience your emotional stress through physical symptoms like aches and pains. Checking in with a trusted authority figure could ease your anxiety on multiple levels. Even if you are not ready to talk things out in detail, just getting reassurance can help. Your troubles will be easier to bear if you know your overall health is intact.","You might feel restless and lonely even if your social life is active, as your tolerance is limited for anything that seems shallow. Take the risk of bringing up a heavy topic like politics or religion, because you may need a sense of significance more than you need peace at this moment. Though you must respect the boundaries of those who don’t want to go there, people who are up for the challenge can give you the depth that you need.","You may be making progress in your career, but someone at home could feel neglected in the process. Showing them how they benefit from your ability to increase your contribution to shared resources might shift their perspective. Don’t get so caught up in managing their emotions that you lose sight of your own, though. You may become resentful if your personal needs are not met, so make sure that the amount of energy you are pouring into your work is sustainable for you, too.","Today it may become apparent that there is a deep divide on an important ideological topic between you and another person in your life. You might have to decide whether the relationship is worth keeping if you cannot come to an agreement. Knowing your answer, at least in your own mind, can guide your next steps. If you want to preserve the relationship no matter what, focus on what binds you together. Whatever you choose, though, being aware that you have a choice may be empowering.","You may be frustrated about money issues at this time, especially if you feel like you are dependent on someone else who is not handling things in the way you would prefer. Peer pressure about the situation might also be increasing your anxiety. If you are able to make more money through your own work, that could lessen the importance of your conflict with the other person. Even though you may not be able to control them, you need something you can control."
2021-10-02,"Genuine pleasure may be on our agenda today, leaving us unsatisfied with mindless hedonism. As sensual Venus makes a fruitful sextile with focused Pluto at 3:48 am EDT, we can party with purpose. The Moon is moving through flamboyant Leo, fueled by contact with Venus and expansive Jupiter, so we could feel especially creative and generous. However, the Moon also acknowledges the collective tensions of distant Pluto and Neptune. There are real problems in the world, but wallowing in things we can't change won’t solve them.","You may now crave connection on multiple levels. While a large group of friends could provide you with an uncomplicated good time, deepening the intimacy in a closer relationship can make you more secure in your own power to build the life you want. This strong bond may also give you the space you need to unravel any baggage that's been keeping you from fully enjoying the moment. Appreciate the unique strengths of your different relationships to make the most of all of them!","A news story could affect you today, as you see how it speaks to the challenges of someone you care about. If you're stressed out by such things in the larger world, focusing on improving your own relationships and making your home a more stable place can help you feel a sense of control. You might not be able to solve everything if a loved one is struggling, but they will probably benefit from what you can offer.","Working hard to achieve beauty in your routine tasks right now can be transformative for you. It may end up being part of your bigger philosophical understanding of the world. The most challenging aspect might be figuring out how to communicate the intense way that you experience this to everyone else. If they aren't able to collaborate on your level, you could still convince them that you need space to do things your way for your own reasons. The important people should respect your needs.","A money issue might be weighing on one of your close relationships, dragging the whole connection into a rut. Try doing something fun together to rejuvenate positive feelings for each other, as the companionship would benefit from you seeing this person through a lens other than irritation. The answer to your financial challenge may come to you once you let go of your intense focus on the problem. A solution could be hiding in plain sight, just waiting for you to adjust your perspective!","Having an attractive and uncluttered living area could be especially important for you at this time. If you can get others who live with you to help clean up, working together would be an opportunity to bond and improve your relationships. However, you might want to clarify in advance who has final authority over the project. No matter how tuned in you feel to the subtle energy of your space, stay aware of the energy of the other people involved as well.","Trying to decide how to spend the day together with a loved one risks your conversation becoming an endless loop of, “I don’t know, what do you want to do?” To break the cycle, try to identify what you both enjoy by talking about it, even if you think that such a conversation might be tedious or unproductive. This may feel like an oddly difficult secret to unravel, but you will eventually identify the answer if the two of you put in the effort.","Spending money on your living space may be worth it today, as you're likely to make an investment you will really appreciate. Your creative approach might even get you attention from your friends or on social media. Remember that you'll be the one who has to maintain whatever you set up, though, so don’t let the excitement of the moment spur you into doing something that's more elaborate than you can realistically keep up long term. Simplicity can be a wonderful form of genius.","Feeling and looking good is easier than ever today, with beautiful Venus active in your sign. Even if you lead a quiet life, casual interactions with the people around you can be very rewarding. Perhaps when you least expect it, your routine goofing around will get you noticed in a good way on a bigger scale, like on social media. Enjoy the attention, but also remember to appreciate any smaller connections you may take for granted. You don’t have to be famous to make a difference!","Labeling your spirituality could be hard for you because it seems like the picture keeps changing. While the details of your path may have fluctuated over time, today you might be able to grasp some continuity by focusing on the underlying morals that have motivated you all along. Your values and your roots can work together now, and if you notice they push you in a particular direction that makes more sense than you thought was possible, you should follow that.","You may be popular with your friends and acquaintances at the moment, but you could still be wondering if they know the real you. This sense of being lonely in a crowd can motivate you to do whatever is necessary to find true intimacy. While taking this risk might be scary, start with someone in your circle who seems like they share your values. You could discover that the potential for connection has been right under your nose for some time.","The work you've quietly been putting into your career may suddenly get noticed, perhaps surprising even you. With your skills getting more attention, you might wind up with increased responsibilities -- even on the weekend. Knowing your limits is also a professional skill, so consider making a strategic alliance with someone in your professional network. While you could already have the seeds of such a relationship growing, take today to talk openly with the person you have in mind to clarify everyone's expectations.","Entertaining events and social connections in the outer world could feel more exciting than tending to your affairs at home. Follow the energy where it leads you, as you'll only be frustrated if you push yourself to do something you find boring. However, you may discover that even fun things need their share of routine maintenance. Your social media accounts, for example, might be due for a tune-up. Taking care of that could be both a fun and productive way to spend the day."
2021-10-03,"Our egos may be easily bruised today as the individualistic Sun tangles with touchy Chiron. On the plus side, communicator Mercury makes a harmonious trine with benevolent Jupiter at 8:05 pm EDT, so we can succeed in talking through what has hurt us. Knowing when to stop talking, however, also has its place. As Chiron and somber Saturn both push on the practical Virgo Moon, our intellectual angst over the larger world’s problems might be relieved by engaging with our physical reality to achieve results we can touch.","Someone you're close with might introduce you to a larger community today. Even if you see the potential for long-term good with this group, you could feel exposed at first. You may want to hide behind your job or focus on your public role in the world as you engage with these people, and that's OK. If the connection develops further, you can let them into the more personal parts of your life later. Do what is necessary for you to feel comfortable now.","You might be good at your job right now -- especially parts of it that involve communication -- but not entirely happy with it. Authority figures there could seem heavy-handed. Try getting in touch with things that really bring you pleasure. While you may not be able to bring it all into your work, adding even a little bit of creativity to your tasks could make the situation more rewarding. You know the show must go on, but it won't hurt to have some fun with it!","Planning a really fun adventure could be easier than usual for you at the moment, as you can see how all the different things you enjoy fit into one big picture. Unfortunately, you might be bummed if your friends don’t seem as into it as you are. Honor their limits, but the story may not be over for you! Your family might be more open than you think to what you have cooked up, so consider the possibility of including them as well.","Someone in a position of power could be criticizing how you currently run your domestic life. Although you may have developed an innovative arrangement that really serves you and those you live with, this might be a good time for you to listen to any complaints. They aren't necessarily right, but every household -- yours included -- could benefit from a group discussion where you all refine the details of your living arrangement. Take into account everyone's perspectives, even the ones you don’t want to hear.","Your close relationships may be full of heavy conversation today. While you will likely be able to get your point across, you could also find that someone genuinely challenges your worldview. This might push you to clarify what you really value, specifically regarding which qualities you want to see more of in the world. It may become apparent that your preferred outcomes aren't going to result from the philosophical or political path you have been pursuing. Stay focused on results.","You might usually build your identity based on your work and your commitments to others, but the intuitive Moon's activity in your sign today makes this a good time for you to take a more personal stand. Particularly, realizing that your values differ from those of someone you're entangled with can motivate you to clarify who you really are. You can be practical and also make your deeper individual needs a priority. Balancing these parts of yourself will help you better utilize any opportunities available to you.","Joy could be a complicated issue for you right now, as you wonder how you can justify experiencing pleasure when others around you are in pain. The safest route may be savoring your happiness in private, where you wouldn't cause any negative reactions from others who have their own problems. That said, if you are able to find a tasteful way to communicate about something fun, that may lift the moods of those around you. Share your cheer with discretion.","An event in the larger world today could free you from a rut of boredom with your job and your home life. Your reaction to this provocation may surprise even you, but if you're honest about it, you've probably had a lot of tension brewing in secret for some time. The more you can be aware of any internal tension and deal with it consciously, the less disruptive it will be in the future. Still, sometimes some disarray is the only way to move forward.","Embracing your serious side now could be rewarded by professional achievement. Your broader social network might also be involved in or, to some extent, responsible for this achievement, so be sure to give credit where credit is due. You may wonder if these people know the real, fun-loving you, but this might not be the time to get into all of that. Nurture these connections to the extent that feels appropriate today -- you can get to know each other better over time.","Professional progress could bring you financial rewards today. It might also help heal any self-worth issues that developed early in your life. Still, once you achieve a goal you've been eyeing for some time, you may wonder if that's all there is. While concrete achievement has tangible benefits that are easy to see, there are also intangible benefits that can increase if you have an idea of how your work fits into your larger sense of purpose. Know why you do what you do!","Strongly identifying with your spiritual or political views may feel good for you at this time, as you could find it comforting to see how you personally fit into a larger purpose. The way you communicate about this with others, however, might be divisive. Figuring out whether conflict and debate are the forms of intimacy you really want in your life can help you pick your battles. Try to focus on connecting with those who share your most important internal paradigms.","The financial help you've been looking for could come from someone who doesn’t want a lot of attention. You may need to look at whether secrecy causes more problems than it solves in this situation. If you feel that your values are compromised by hiding the truth from others who have a legitimate interest in the matter, it might be time to push for public recognition of a connection that has been developing in private. Don't be afraid to say something!"
2021-10-04,"Anxiety may provoke us to grasp for security as the fretful Virgo Moon opposes inconclusive Neptune at 5:48 pm EDT. If we can bear to look at reality, however, we might discover we have more resources for moving forward than we think. Today the Moon also forms helpful trines with innovative Uranus and powerful Pluto, which are both in grounded Earth signs. We may need to try something new, but we have the sense now to identify the risks that are likely to work out.","You may be wondering what is realistic for you to expect from a job. Finding a clear career path, enough money to meet your needs, and a sense of meaning from what you do all in the same place can be a lot to ask. Right now, you might be able to get more of those three things if you are not attached to them manifesting in a very specific way. Given the room to do so, people can pleasantly surprise you.","Creative expression can be rewarding for you at this time. You are in a good position to catch the vague vibes that are floating around in the collective and corral them into physical form. Don't feel like you have to create a masterpiece -- it could be as simple as a particularly clever meme for social media. Either way, your artwork may resonate with the people around you, as they feel like you said what everyone was already thinking. Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame.","The complex parts of your family dynamics may be calling your attention now. Though you might idealize a key person, you could also be aware of secrets and entanglements going back a long time. Balancing that knowledge as you continue to interact with your family may be challenging, but try to stay focused on what people concretely need in the present moment. What you know about the bigger picture can inform you, but don’t feel obligated to solve all of that today.","You may idealize a philosophical or spiritual path without being very articulate about its details. You could actually be afraid that, if you tried to clarify the details, your connection would lose its magic. Knowing what you are talking about, however, can help you communicate your passion to the people in your life. You might have to decide whether savoring pleasure alone or being understood by others is more important to you right now, but a strong belief system should survive a little conversation.","Making a difference in the world could be especially important to you at this time, and you might be ready to put your own money toward the change you want to see. What you want, however, may surprise even you. If your career path has shifted over the past few years, what you have experienced in that regard could inform what you now value. Identifying the things that you care about enough to invest in can help you concretely see how you have grown.","Having to be the practical one in a relationship can feel like a lot of pressure. What might be news to you, however, is that the other person could be under pressure, too, if they have to carry the weight of YOUR less-than-practical desires for creative expression and adventure. Try to be honest with yourself right now about the full range of your own interests. You may enjoy others more if you can acknowledge where they end and you begin.","Ambiguity in your work or routine could be frustrating for you now. If you just can’t get rid of it, you might look at whether you are secretly getting something out of the lack of clarity. Perhaps your upbringing led you to believe that being direct tends to end badly, or that people can't get disappointed about unmet expectations if the expectations are never described out loud. Today, you may be able to both understand your early influences and take the risk of trying a new approach.","You may feel like a chameleon right now, blending in with the people around you to the point you are not sure of your own sense of self. That doesn’t mean the people you have chosen to be around are necessarily wrong for you, though. This is more about you than it is them, and they may actually be able to indirectly guide you through it. If the parts of you that tend to come out around your friends feel good, follow that feeling.","Professional achievement may be possible for you today, but be careful not to burden it with unrelated expectations. You might feel driven to throw yourself into your work because you seem to have control over the outcome there -- as opposed to your home life, where other people may be creating a chaotic and unpredictable atmosphere. Appreciate what you are able to accomplish right now, but realize you can’t fix everything. True emotional security must be cultivated within.","An enlightening book or other teaching you encounter today could give you the words you didn't even know you needed. With this language, you may finally be able to describe a physical or psychological pattern of yours, and once you can name it, a lot of things could suddenly make sense. Still, you may need some time alone to chew on what you have learned. While you might later use this knowledge to find others with similar experiences, understanding yourself will probably be your greatest desire for now.","Someone who is financially dependent on you may actually be taking advantage of you. You might need to look at what you get out of keeping the arrangement going, though. Perhaps you secretly enjoy the power or even the security of continually being needed. Even if it is scary in the moment, renegotiating your idea of what makes you safe could ultimately be liberating for both you and the other person. Understand your own contribution before confronting them.","You may feel like you're being pushed by people in your life to pin down the details of your plans, while you prefer to leave more room for spontaneity. Be realistic about how much spontaneity is actually likely to happen, though. Also, be honest with yourself about whether keeping things vague is a way for you to maintain power over others. They may actually agree to do what you want if you just ask for it directly, so give that a try."
2021-10-05,"We may be very good at identifying the structures in our lives that lack foundation today. As intellectual Mercury makes a frustrating quincunx with illusory Neptune at 9:53 am EDT, staying grounded could be hard. However, we can nurture each other in concrete ways when the Moon in practical Virgo forms a fortunate sextile with sensual Venus. The Moon then moves into judicious Libra and forms a harmonious trine with structured Saturn this evening, helping to give our thoughts clarity.","On an external level, life might be going well for you. Work may be stable enough that it allows you to think about your long-term financial goals, and you could even feel comfortable introducing someone special to your larger group of friends. Although you may feel like status or surface concerns are taking precedence over your spiritual plights, keep in mind that you cannot take care of everything every day. Today’s energy favors outward activity, so reflection may just have to come later.","You could be on the edge of a breakthrough in your career, as your routine work is giving you clarity on your bigger ambitions. With a lot of energy going in this direction, you may not have room in your schedule to socialize with your broader circle of acquaintances. Being nurtured in a close relationship, however, can give you the secure foundation you need to plot your next professional move. Make time for the connections that really give you the support you need to be yourself.","Working to make your home more beautiful may be rewarding for you at this time, as an uncluttered living space can help you think clearly. With this physical support in place, you might be able to grasp a mental picture that really connects a lot of dots. However, sorting out an issue related to your career could still be challenging. You may not be able to come up with an answer for that today, but see if you can at least identify the question.","Although you may have ideological differences with your family, they could also be supportive of you in terms of financial or material resources. How you negotiate this awkward situation could come down to how you explain it to yourself. Today, you have an opportunity to examine your story and update it as needed. Be honest about what is not working for you, but also acknowledge the benefits you are receiving. Seeing the full picture can help you decide how to move forward.","You can communicate clearly in a close relationship right now, but you might still try to keep things light. Interrupting the peaceful flow of conversation by bringing up a heavy topic could seem unappealing. If you are trying to keep a secret from the other person, though, they may pick up on it just through their intuition. You don’t have to dive headfirst into the deep end of honesty, but try testing the waters in an orderly way.","Work may come with more financial advantages than usual for you now. However, a positive development of this sort could cause conflict in a close relationship if someone else feels entitled to a piece of your bonus. If you know in advance that even a good change might be coming, communicating it early may reduce the likelihood of the other person feeling blindsided and reacting badly. Try to negotiate boundaries and establish expectations with them ahead of time.","Expressing creativity in your physical appearance may feel especially appealing to you now. Still, there might be limits to how much flair you are able to display in your workplace or another public environment. If it turns out that some things you really value have to stay in your private life, you can mitigate the frustration by making the domain you do have control over as nurturing a place as it can be. Although the outer world has its restrictions, your personal life is whatever you want it to be.","Keeping some parts of your family dynamics private may make sense to you now, and there's nothing wrong with that. A creative outlet, however, can be helpful for releasing any tension that has built up in you over whatever is going on at home. Expressing your artistic side might also be good for entertaining your friends, who are likely to be a supportive audience. Even if they don’t know everything about what's happening in your life, you may be comforted that they are there for you.","You may have a good sense of what is public versus what is private right now. Your professional life can especially benefit from your sensitivity toward the hidden side of things and your ability to handle it with discretion. You could also connect with your larger social network in a satisfying way without giving away the details of your personal matters. As long as you are not hiding something in order to avoid dealing with it, knowing what to keep to yourself is a good thing.","The financial aspects of your career may be more clearly visible than usual at this time. Other parts of your professional life, however, could tend to be implied rather than talked out directly. If you need help, try seeing what your social network or an informed author advises about the type of ambiguity you are dealing with. If they point out obvious potential for it to end badly, you might need to push for changes. If they don't wave any red flags, though, follow the guidance of your intuition.","Sharing the specific details of your political or spiritual views could feel easier than usual to you at this time, and you may be proud to represent your philosophy in public. Though you might find others who agree with you and appreciate what you have to say, the hard part could come when you must go forward in your private life and live out what you advocate. You may see the things you want differently when you have to pay for them yourself.","Close relationships tend to benefit from a shared sense of adventure and philosophical compatibility. However, as much as you may have in common with someone who's important to you, there could be things you are not ready to reveal to them. You might be able to organize your own thinking about a heavy issue right now, but integrating those insights into your identity could be a bigger challenge that won’t be checked off your to-do list today. Enjoy what others have to offer, but honor limits -- theirs and yours."
2021-10-06,"While we might be able to agree that feeling good is important, deciding how to make it happen could be harder. Today's New Moon in Libra at 7:05 am EDT helps us articulate our visions of beauty and fairness. Energetic Mars, also in Libra, supplies power to pursue this dream, but as he quincunxes shocking Uranus, we are reminded that the reality of the physical world can override what we think things should be. Meanwhile, potent Pluto turns direct, pushing us along our path of transformation.","Starting a partnership could be on your mind at the moment, as two heads are often better than one. Whether your new connection is with a coworker, a therapist, or anyone else, remember to keep sight of your own values and responsibilities. You might secretly wish the other person would serve as an authority figure who could take the blame for any negative results, but you'll have a better chance of a good outcome if you commit to approaching things as a fellow dependable adult.","Though you might think improving your health would enhance your attractiveness, the process can end up being more complicated than that -- at least in the short term. Eliminating something unhealthy from your body might have an unfortunate side effect, like making you break out or otherwise feel worse before you feel better. This may be frustrating if you weren't expecting it to happen. Still, try to trust the process and remind yourself of the eventual benefits in store. A bit of irritation now could lead to an amazing future!","Using dark humor to express your feelings about difficult or hidden subjects could be a form of both creativity and release today. This may be different from your usual style, but sometimes you have to get the tough stuff out of the way before you can get back to lighthearted fun. While some people might not handle this intense approach very well, the right audience could really get a kick out of it. Just keep in mind that your own catharsis will likely be more rewarding than social validation.","Friends may give you support to break out of a rut in your home or family life right now, but watch out for someone who's more interested in being considered helpful than in actually helping you. Even so, that kind of person could genuinely assist you in identifying the manipulative behavior of someone else in your life -- in the sense that it takes one to know one. If you work with them there, you can tell them in good conscience that they really did help.","You may be able to get the things you want from an authority figure today, but you might have to ask for them directly. While you could worry that speaking up will disturb the peace, dropping hints won't fix the discomfort you're already experiencing. Once you begin to assert yourself, though, you can't always control what happens next! The potential risk involved there might be the scariest part. Keeping quiet can help you feel in control, but it also keeps you from progressing.","Getting your money in order may tug on your thoughts all day long, and a book or finance guru might have convinced you that you can do it. That said, be careful of one-size-fits-all solutions! Stuffing yourself into a mold that doesn't quite fit could just frustrate you with the whole project. While it's perfectly fine to be inspired by someone else who has conquered their financial problems, make sure that any plan you set up takes your unique situation into account.","Sharing resources with someone else could be constraining you today, as you try to assert your own point of view or goals. It might be time to ask yourself if you're getting enough rewards out of this commitment to justify the ways it restricts you. Deciding whether to stay or go likely won't be easy, but a third option may be able to stabilize the arrangement with just a few adjustments. With today's New Moon in your sign, you can be the champion of balance!","A partnership that has been growing out of public view may suddenly demand recognition. While it's not necessarily wrong to be discreet about your personal connections, there is a difference between secrecy and privacy. The cagey communication that's necessary to keep things on the down-low could be difficult enough to push whoever you're quietly connecting with into loud rebellion. If you have a valid reason for wanting privacy, hear out the other person's concerns and figure out how to address them as a team.","Social activities may be full of exciting opportunities for you! Unfortunately, you could be tempted to engage with them to the point that you have trouble taking care of your work obligations or doing what you need to for your health. To draw the line between pleasure and responsibility, you might need to look at what you really value in life. Your priorities could have shifted since you last thought deeply about this, so take today to consider your current mindset.","Opportunities to advance in your field could fuel your climb up the professional ladder today. You might, however, like the idea of some of these changes more than you enjoy the reality of the duties involved. As you try to decide what to do, pay attention to the messages coming from your own body. Accepting a position of authority that makes it difficult for you to express yourself could cause friction. You'll have to determine whether the career benefits make up for the creative drawbacks.","You could experience a truly revolutionary breakthrough today on a philosophical or intellectual level. However, this might generate feelings of distance from your family, as it provokes you to question the way you were raised. Try to get clarity about what specifically feels like it's holding you back, instead of rebelling indiscriminately against every part of your upbringing. You probably do have things you need to work on, but your most significant problems might not be the obvious ones. Don't settle for instant gratification.","The only way to get to the bottom of a situation involving shared resources is to discuss it with the people involved! Peer pressure might be influencing the way things are currently drifting along, but clear and direct communication can help you construct an arrangement that truly works for each person in the situation. Try holding a serious conversation today about what everyone is looking for. Don't be afraid to be realistic about your own needs for physical comfort instead of thinking you should tough it out with less."
2021-10-07,"Emotional conflict may cause friction today, whether it's with the strict structures of society or our own personal stubbornness. As the melodramatic Moon moves from intellectual Libra to secretive Scorpio, it also forms challenging squares with both withholding Pluto and stern Saturn. Fortunately, pleasure-loving Venus enters Sagittarius at 7:21 am EDT, helping us find joy in adventure and learning. Instead of picking apart the things that upset us, we might be better off if we set them aside and try to have fun!","You may feel drawn to try something new in your approach to relationships and intimacy, even if it's very different from the examples that authority figures and your peers provide. You might not be wrong, but you could benefit from at least some guidance as you blaze your own trail. If no one you know can advise you, try to find a book or website of someone who's already traveled the path you're considering. Learn from their mistakes instead of making any yourself!","A close relationship could feel like work for you today. It doesn't have to be that way, though, despite what you may think. Starting now, Venus favors intimacy for you, so take the risk of questioning the norms of this companionship. You might discover that there's a difference between busywork and addressing a real challenge: the former will have you spinning your wheels, but the latter can actually move you forward! Take advantage of this moment because you can negotiate the tough stuff more kindly than usual now.","You may feel like you have to choose between pleasure and duty today. Luckily, sweet Venus is boosting your ability to connect with people individually at the moment, so finding a collaborator to help you with your responsibilities could help you whistle while you work. While your main focus for the moment might need to be completing a particular task, finding someone competent, calm, and practical to rely on may help you forge significant relationships now and in the future.","You may want to relax and do your own thing right now, but someone close could be pushing you to deal with heavy issues in your connection with them. As caring Venus begins supporting your approach to relationship responsibilities, you might consider trying to do some random acts of kindness on a regular basis to strengthen this partnership. While you may not get out of the serious conversation this time, building a strong, nurturing foundation could reduce the need for talks like that going forward.","A close relationship of yours could be weighed down by the responsibilities of living together or making each other feel secure. This brush with reality may feel more burdensome than usual as Venus is now pushing you to pursue things that bring you personal pleasure. Although your sign has a reputation for being a bit self-focused to begin with, the other person might enjoy your company more if you find a way to share your fun! This may be just the reboot your connection needs.","Beautifying your environment could be your focus now as indulgent Venus begins to light up your domestic life. Figuring out how to make your plans happen, however, could be daunting at first. While you might be reluctant to spend money, doing it yourself may not be any cheaper once you itemize everything involved. Spend some time thinking through what will make you feel more secure: money in your bank account or a home tailored to your needs. Either way, the choice is yours!","Finding the line between sweet talk and manipulation could be difficult as charming Venus begins to highlight communication for you now. Still, you might not particularly care if you cross that line, because rationality probably feels less effective when it comes to stubborn social or familial dynamics. Try to have a clear idea of your values in your mind so you can identify situations where you absolutely have to engage. Avoiding unnecessary conversations and unproductive drama will help you keep your interactions peaceful.","Speaking your truth at home could be difficult, as loved ones may seem indifferent to hearing about your personal experiences. You might have to pursue something you want by yourself if you can't persuade anyone else to go in on it with you. Starting today, though, affluent Venus is boosting your financial and material resources, so your independent efforts might turn out better than you think! Even your current detractors may become interested in you once they see you succeed.","People may be drawn to your confidence, as you can both look and feel good with lovely Venus dancing into your sign today. You might feel lonely in a crowd, though, if you can't be honest with those around you about the things you really value. Pay attention to these concerns, because they can show you which friendships or communities aren't working out for you. You don't have to dramatically cut anyone off, but you can choose where you invest your time.","The public persona you display in your career and community might be at odds with your more private identity and values. While some gaps are probably inevitable, this could be a good time for you to intentionally identify the personal secrets you hold, as vulnerable Venus begins to favor the hidden parts of your life today. Keeping something private can benefit you if you know what you're doing and why you're doing it, but a secret that you're less aware of can cause trouble.","You might notice some shifts now in the influences and philosophies that contribute to your identity. While you may be inclined to throw out as much as you can in hopes of starting fresh, stay in touch with your friends as you go through this process. Each part of your past contributed to who you are now and is part of the story that brought you to your current community. Change may be necessary, but don't forget to acknowledge what has worked for you.","Being seen can be a relief -- as long as you have nothing to hide. Starting today, charming Venus is increasing your visibility in the job field and other public areas of your life. As useful as that is, you don't want to waste this opportunity being visible for the wrong things. If you're perceived as manipulative, you may need to honestly reflect on whether there is any truth to this complaint. Fortunately, any course correction or behavioral changes you make now will also be visible."
2021-10-08,"We may get some personal satisfaction from picking fights as the assertive Sun meets aggressive Mars in Libra at 12:01 am EDT. Beyond these conflicts that everyone already knows about, long-held grievances could be expressed in a way that seems to come out of nowhere when the Moon in brooding Scorpio opposes impulsive Uranus. Just being heard out could heal a lot, though, as the Moon also makes a helpful trine with empathic Neptune. Responding to rage with peace can help to defuse it.","Money matters may become more complicated right now if someone else gets involved in them. You might feel like this person is disrespecting your boundaries and aggressively pushing their way into your business. Help could come to you from unexpected places, though, so try to look past your frustration to see whether whatever they are demanding is actually a good idea in spite of their obnoxious approach. If the cost of their assistance really does outweigh the benefits, you may have to insist that they back off.","You could feel apprehensive about expressing yourself today, for fear of what your social network might think. Still, you may be holding on to a tremendous amount of energy at the moment, and not having an outlet for it might even make you physically uncomfortable. Taking the risk of shocking people is probably your best option at this point. Even if someone reacts badly at first, that is not necessarily the end of the story. Your example could ultimately be needed to liberate them.","You may be particularly sensitive to the needs of an authority figure in your life right now, to the point that you wind up holding on to a secret of theirs for them. If you get too entwined with this person, however, it could warp your sense of boundaries and make it difficult for you to actually maintain their privacy when it's necessary. Finding opportunities to heartily express yourself in your personal life could be a way to help keep your own story separate from theirs.","Your creative side is calling today, but it could be hard for you to distinguish whether you are more interested in expressing yourself or in getting people's attention. Alleviating loneliness is a valid need, especially if frustrations at home make that an unsatisfying place to connect at the moment. Art for a particular audience, however, may be different from art for your own personal catharsis. Try to think through what outcome you want, and that can help you work out how to get there.","You could be confrontational in your communication today, but maybe someone had it coming. A family member who is acting recklessly might need to hear about the impact their choices are having on others. Even if you're frustrated, acknowledging how the larger family dynamic weighs on this person can be key to getting your message across. They may be more likely to listen to you if they can tell you have empathy for their side of the story.","Forming a strategic alliance can support your pursuit to make more money, or at least preserve the funds you already have. The right financial adviser or business partner could shift your mindset, helping you see possibilities you weren't able to see before. Remember to be responsible for your own end of the equation, though, and don’t let your greed lure you into a plan that isn't grounded in reality. While fresh ideas can make things better, anything that sounds too good to be true probably is.","You can be a fierce advocate for yourself today, and you might especially have an eye on your money. If you're thinking about asking for a raise at work, first get clear on what you really hope to achieve. You will likely be happy with increased compensation if the only hole you're trying to fill is a financial one. However, if your dissatisfaction is more about feeling unappreciated or mistreated on an emotional level, be realistic about what money can fix.","Another person in your life might take up more than their share of space if you don’t claim yours. Though you may feel like they are constantly provoking you, they probably have no idea that you are silently seething. To alleviate your frustration, you may need to abandon the security of blending into the background and assert yourself more. While it might be scary and uncomfortable at first, try to keep in mind that the other person did not necessarily cause this discomfort.","You may be especially active right now in a community you belong to, but be aware of when your passion crosses the line into pushing others around. It could be very easy to lose perspective in this way if you are obsessively looking to this group to satisfy needs that aren't getting met in other areas of your life. While these people may appreciate the good you have to offer them, know when to step back and tend to your own business.","Intense power dynamics in your workplace might push you to think that everything must come to a battle royale. Another community you belong to, however, could remind you that there are other ways for humans to interact with each other. This reality check may be just what you need to stay grounded right now. Knowing that others in your life value you regardless of whatever happens in your career could also give you the confidence to do what you need to do at work without fear.","You may feel it's important for everyone to agree with you about some serious matter today, and you could even be willing to do whatever seems necessary to make that happen. If you look honestly at the approach you are using, though, you might see shades of the way that someone else bullied you in the past. Discovering that you face similar temptations may help you develop empathy for whoever caused you pain. Healing can come when you least expect it.","You may be inclined to talk about your spiritual beliefs at this time, which could arouse in you a craving for something more. Unfortunately, a transformative experience might not be the easiest thing to obtain in the moment. Even if you can't force something outside the bounds of routine life to come to you, though, you can still follow your curiosity forward into the unknown. That way, you at least guarantee you will learn something new."
2021-10-09,"Our words could fly faster than speeding bullets today. As intellectual Mercury, still moving through his confusing retrograde, conjuncts the individualistic Sun and then aggressive Mars, we might be tempted to spill our opinions first and ask questions later. However, when the emotional Moon meets pleasant Venus in bold Sagittarius at 3:37 pm EDT, we may be able to find the good intentions behind any rougher sentiments. Keeping small offenses in perspective can stop them from becoming fights.",Simply sitting around doing nothing at the moment is not the best way for you to spend time with someone you care about. You may have a lot of energy that needs to be expressed in some way -- you might even start a totally unnecessary fight if you don't have any better options. Try to find a way to escape your usual routine and have an adventure together. Seeing that the world is bigger than the two of you could be very refreshing.,"Proper perspective is vital today, particularly if you're looking to make progress on a matter of shared money or property. You probably have more energy than most at this time, helping you to notice the finer points or small details of your arrangement and to propose adjustments to them. While you might be able to catch some things that need to be dealt with, others may eventually run out of patience for your exacting approach. Try to identify and focus on the most important problems.","A close relationship can provide you with both security and pleasure right now. Still, if it seems too good to be true, you might feel compelled to test the boundaries of how far you can express yourself with the other person. This may be a necessary part of establishing norms in a newer relationship, but you must avoid crossing the line into punishing them for the failures of others. Don't blame this person for the actions of those in the past.","You have the potential to manifest beauty in the physical world today, and you could also have plenty of energy raring to implement it in your home immediately. Even so, be careful to respect others who share your space! No matter how awesome your idea is, how you present it might be what determines if everyone else wants to use it. All the beauty in the world is no good if it's pursued in a way that makes people feel trampled.","For once, a long list of errands today could appeal to you, as you might enjoy getting out and about. You may think of extra stops once you begin your itinerary, so make sure you're not crunched for time. Impulse buys could also be enticing once you enter this zone of having fun and feeling good, and the longer it has been since you last did something like this, the wilder you might go. It's OK to let loose and get it out of your system!","Intense activity could be buzzing around the money in your life currently. In the midst of this chaos, taking a moment today to appreciate your home and family may help you gain needed perspective. It can be useful to think about how your loved ones would benefit from increased financial security, but connecting with them on a deeper level would be more valuable. If what they truly need most right now is your emotional presence, the other stuff may be able to wait.","You could be at a point where big changes in your image or identity are becoming obvious to the people around you, even if these things have been developing for a while in the background. This process might be difficult, but taking your frustrations out on those around you may only add to your challenges. Today, you might be more capable than usual of telling your story gently. When you give people the benefit of the doubt, they may surprise you with their kindness.","Financial matters could be going well for you at the moment, and it may not be obvious to others how you're making it happen. As a result, you've been on the receiving end of rumors and speculation. You might have to decide which you value more: your privacy or people knowing the truth about you. Remember that idle chatter doesn't have to have larger consequences or even be believed! Your best option might be to let others think what they want until they move on to the next shiny thing.","Tension may be brewing in your community or friend group today, but you've got a chance to come out of it still looking good. You don't have to insert yourself into the drama or try to mediate between warring parties directly. If you just stay on the sidelines and maintain a peaceful presence, others might eventually gravitate toward someone calm and rational. You may not be able to stop everyone from getting heated, but you can stop yourself from joining them.","You may have a sweet side that you're afraid to share with the larger world. Putting up a combative front could seem safer, as you suspect that people might try to take advantage of you if you seem at all vulnerable. While the need to be guarded may be a lesson you learned the hard way, a worthy friend could really benefit right now from the parts of yourself you hide. Think about finding a person with whom you can be more open today.","Being right about anything can be its own reward, but you might be tempted to push for more than that today. If your friends call you out on your determination to win against whoever you think is wrong, take their advice to calm down. They may be able to observe consequences of your approach that aren't visible to you yet, and they're looking out for your future! Let the kindness of your friends help you remember how to be kind to others in return.","Your public image may be in a good place at the moment, as you're able to communicate emotional warmth to others. Under these circumstances, it might make sense to revisit an issue of shared money or property that has caused some unresolved frustration for you in the past. While sorting it out now will likely have its challenges, you've grown since you last attempted to tackle this matter. Consulting a mentor might be in your best interest, so reach out for a helping hand today."
2021-10-10,"We may enjoy pushing for productivity today as the impressionable Moon in optimistic Sagittarius forms a set of driving sextiles with Mercury, Mars, and the Sun, all in logical Libra. Taskmaster Saturn also turns direct at 10:17 pm EDT, moving us along the path to our ambitions. Still, we might have to admit we can't get everything done in one day. When the Moon falls into a challenging square with unfocused Neptune tonight, it could be time to get some rest.","Going on an adventure or learning about something new together could be a great way to strengthen your relationship with someone close right now. That said, some time alone at the end of the day might be crucial for understanding all of the information you gather during this experience. While a companion can show you things you might not realize on your own, they can't understand the direct relevance of that information to your personal life. You're the only one who can do that for yourself.","Confidence in your progress toward a major personal or professional goal could have you feeling ready to tell your friends some big news. Their reaction, however, might not be exactly what you want it to be. If they blurt out something thoughtless, don't let their knee-jerk opinions throw you off. While you've had plenty of time to think through all of the pros and cons on your way to your decision, your friend may be starting from square one.","A companion could help you find a playful attitude today, one that you might have thought was impossible for you. Letting loose with a friend usually feels great, but right now your shared fun might be muted by the voice of an authority figure lurking in your head, telling you to be more serious. This may be a good opportunity for you to revise your ideas about who has control over you. You could be giving a person from your past more power than they deserve in the present.","A home improvement project could be tempting you to work yourself to exhaustion at the moment, especially if you don't have a very clear idea of your desired end result. Instead of chasing unproductively after a vague mirage, you might need to step back for a moment and remember why you took on this project. Getting in touch with your true motivation can help you determine a specific course of action that will help lead you to a satisfying outcome.","You may be witty and chatty today as you enjoy lighthearted conversation with everyone around you. You could end up feeling lonely in a crowd, however, if your need for more depth is not met. Your desires for seriousness and stability in your relationships might conflict with this need, particularly if you fear that opening up would scare off even people you've known a long time. Still, the best way to identify your truly fulfilling connections is to roll up your sleeves and take that risk!","Feelings of security -- or of lacking security -- could drive you to focus on financial concerns today. You can successfully work on the parts of your situation that you have personal control over, but if another person is involved, you might not be seeing their contribution clearly. Whether you're overestimating or underestimating their work, your idea of what they're doing could cause you a lot of unwarranted stress. Make sure that you have the facts before you fret.","Talking to others about changes in your life may exhaust you, especially if they demand all the details. It might seem like you can only find the support you need by letting someone invade your personal life, but you don't have to say more than you find comfortable. This may be a good time for you to lay out your boundaries around self-expression. Being specific about the help you actually want could also give the person you're speaking with something more productive to do than dig for information.","A hidden part of your life might be the perfect place to mine for an extra income stream right now. Still, as beneficial as it may be, the thought of openly expressing something that's private to you could be daunting. Look for the best of both worlds by creating a protected space for your more sensitive content, either physically or metaphorically. Although not everyone is equipped to handle all of you, others may really need what you have to offer.","You could feel pulled in multiple directions today, and it might seem impossible to make everybody happy. Friends may want you to hang out while your family also asks for your time. As these people present their desires, remember that no matter how persuasive they are, you should ultimately listen to your own voice. Beyond being liked or keeping the peace, make sure your needs also factor into the day's activities. You deserve a say just as much as anyone else!","The sensitivity you have right now to dynamics going on behind the scenes can make you more effective in your public life. As important as your awareness of unspoken feelings may be, though, you might risk taking it too far. Keep in mind that every little coincidence is not necessarily part of a vast hidden agenda. Sometimes events really are as simple as they appear, and there's no need to read into them further. Do your best to balance your intuition with your regular perception.","An extraordinarily adventurous idea you have today could be a little intimidating -- even for you. You might ask for your friends' opinions, and it's likely they'll encourage you to do it. Don't let them push you into doing something that conflicts with your important values, but a little bit of confrontation may be exactly what you need to identify what's really important to you. You might not know your line in the sand until you see it.","You have an opportunity to bring some of your hidden intensity into your public image at this time. Still, a part of you might resist this as it tries to maintain deniability of any potentially controversial opinions you hold. To move toward greater openness, try to intentionally decide what's really necessary for you to keep to yourself and what it would be OK to share. If you're clearly aware of the secrets you have, you can have less fear that they'll slip out without warning."
2021-10-11,"Optimism is ours as the day begins with a fortunate sextile between the upbeat Sagittarius Moon and lucky Jupiter. Though this might bring a mellow and relaxed atmosphere, we could still find ourselves wanting to buckle down and get to work when the Moon moves into practical Capricorn at 1:15 pm EDT. Dreaming often comes before doing, though, so there's no need to feel guilty about any less productive moments. Everything, even resting, has an important part to play in our lives.","A friend could have a lot to say about a great book or blog they've been reading lately, and you shouldn't gloss over this conversation. This could be just the hot tip you need to freshen your intellectual life -- it might even help you professionally as well. Whether you learn about a whole new field of work that intrigues you or just discover a way to get better at what you do already, you can greatly benefit from studying the experiences or methods of others right now.","Don't be afraid to get in touch with your inner depths now. While you may sometimes prefer to keep things on a practical level, exploring a more confusing part of your emotions could be just what you need, personally and professionally. You might need to spend some time chewing on any new insights to figure out how they fit into your larger worldview. While even the clearest philosophy can't capture everything, it can contain a lot. Use today to figure out what yours contains.","Someone may come to you for advice today, and you could be delighted with the opportunity to strut your intellectual stuff! That said, you can probably learn something from the encounter too, so don't let your ego get in the way of a fruitful exchange. The biggest challenge you face might be determining how deep to let this connection go. While you may enjoy the increased intimacy, changing the established dynamic of the relationship could be unsettling. Be thoughtful as you open up.","An arrangement to pool money or property with others may currently help you achieve results you wouldn't be capable of on your own, but it will still take effort on your part. As you put in your necessary share of work to maintain this system, you could particularly gain from improving your relationship with the other people involved. Though you may be used to only interacting with them for limited reasons, they could turn out to be interesting people even outside of that context.","A close relationship might be in a good place right now, giving you room to have fun and express yourself. The resulting boost to your confidence -- in both your creativity and your ability to connect with others -- could improve your performance on even your less fun responsibilities. While you might feel like the practical side of life is not your strong suit, remembering things that you are good at can empower you to blossom in all areas of life.","Working to beautify your home could be rewarding for you today, as you have an eye for spotting changes that would make your environment more comfortable. You will probably feel better in a space that looks good, but follow your own preferences rather than those of a decorating guru. Once you've created or cleaned up a space that nurtures your unique needs, you may find that you're able to express yourself with more clarity and creativity than usual. Your surroundings can really make a difference!","You might not know what you enjoy when you see it, but you could know it when you say it! A good conversation may help you identify your passions today. Even something that makes you laugh might be an important hint. If you get an insight of this sort, try to work it into your personal life and space. While having a secure and organized home is necessary, you might be surprised at how much better things can be when you make room for pleasure there as well.","Positive developments in your domestic life could help you see the value in spending more money there. Your investment, in turn, might result in you having even more of whatever's going well for you. Furthermore, if you wind up occupied with a home improvement project where curious neighbors can see you, this may be a worthwhile opportunity to get to know them better. There's a lot of favorable energy available for you in this part of your life right now, so let the good times roll!","A big conversation could be really rewarding for you today. Bringing your emotional experiences into the discussion in a way that's constructive rather than disruptive can help you find the validation of being heard. If you listen attentively to the other person's contributions as well, this might bring clarity to the way both of your values intersect on an important matter. Even if their perspective isn't quite the same as yours, a respectful exchange can leave everyone involved feeling supported and connected.","You may think you know what you value in life, but there could still be things you take for granted. Use your time today to think about any assumptions you have that may not be as universally shared as you think they are -- or think they should be. Whether or not you retain these parts of your paradigm after you become aware of them, the act of making thoughtful choices and having informed opinions can help you move through life with greater confidence.","Being comfortable with your identity can help you enjoy connecting with your friends today. True self-confidence, however, includes knowing that your friends won't abandon you if you need to take a mental health break. Pay attention to your energy levels and take a timeout from socializing if you're physically or emotionally tired. No matter how much people may want to spend time with you, when you're exhausted and need to rest, it's up to you to take a step back. Give yourself the gift of self-care!","Your public visibility could get you the attention of someone who wants to help you, though they might ask to stay private for now. In the long run, this connection will likely be useful for your larger ambitions. For now, though, you may have to maintain discretion about any developments like these that are brewing out of sight as you continue your usual routines with your broader social network. To reduce the temptation to spill your news, try asking others how they're doing instead."
2021-10-12,"The hard facts of reality may challenge our sunny ideals as the serious Capricorn Moon squares the optimistic Libra Sun at 11:25 pm EDT. Storyteller Mercury, still retrograde, similarly gets smacked by the Moon, so we may wonder how far back into the past our difficulties stretch. Still, when innovative Uranus nudges Mercury, we can start to form a new narrative. As Uranus also makes a harmonious trine with the Moon, we can move forward by staying grounded in our physical experiences.","An important relationship in your life could seem to be holding you back from the status or success you crave. It may turn out that you are able to combine your competing interests more than you think, though. Instead of trying to figure everything out in your own head, as capable as you may be, talk to the person you have the issue with. When you examine together what you really value, you may see a clear path forward.","You may be drawn to something that promises to improve your health or beauty, but putting in the actual work to make it happen could get tedious. Your beliefs about the situation might also make your experience worse than it needs to be. Ask yourself what you hope to get out of the change you are wanting to implement, and honestly reflect on whether your expectations are realistic. Though instant gratification may not be possible, more gradual gains could be worth pursuing.","You could feel a stronger urge than usual to express yourself today, but you might reach a point where you find yourself on the verge of sharing something you have long held back for a reason. Although you may think your only options are to either impulsively blurt out the whole story or to continue holding on to your secret for the rest of your life, that's not true. Instead, think through what you can tell in a way that allows you to maintain control over your narrative.","Your relationship with a member of your family may be frustrating for you at this time. If you choose to vent to your friends about the situation, be clear that you are looking for sympathy rather than advice. Their conventional wisdom might not fit the unique dynamics of your family, but they can probably relate to your emotional experience. As you get heard out, you might even wind up talking yourself through a resolution for your family drama.","There could be a lot of conversation in the course of your work today. Though you might not get things done quickly, taking extra time to talk could serve another important purpose, like strengthening your professional relationships or nailing down the details of a major project. Still, you may need to be able to determine when a quest for agreement is no longer productive. At that point, you might have to start discussing how to move forward if everyone cannot get on the same page.","Although you may not feel comfortable taking many risks when it comes to your money management, avoiding risk can have its own problems. It may not even be a specific danger that you're concerned about, rather a feeling that you aren't qualified to determine what is and isn't a worthy investment. Building your knowledge about financial matters right now -- perhaps with the help of someone more informed -- can help you let go of these inhibitions that are not serving you well.","Family dynamics could be intense for you at this time, and you may be a key person in whatever is going on. If everyone agrees that you are the troublesome one, then at least you have convinced them to agree on something! On some level, you might even enjoy the power of being in this position. Instead of focusing on what you can personally gain from your time in the spotlight, though, try using it to help the group reach a transformative outcome that benefits everyone.","Relying on someone else to keep a secret for you could be risky right now, because sharing your hidden information might strike the other person as a way for them to feel powerful. Instead, beat them at their own game and let your secret out yourself. Though opening up to others can be scary, being honest and even showing your emotional side a little bit could be just the change you need to help your relationships grow.","Working some of your ethical values into simpler parts of your life like your diet or daily routine could give you an exhilarating sense of being in harmony with something bigger than yourself. For the moment, though, it might put you out of step with your friends. They may not be judgmental of anything in particular, just surprised to see a side of you that is new to them. If they cannot give you the validation you crave right now, your own satisfaction will have to be enough.","Although you may usually like to keep your public image polished, you might find yourself reacting or expressing yourself in more emotional ways right now. While this could cause some discomfort for you or others in the immediate moment, that might not be the end of the story. People may take advantage of you if you never speak up, because they think you are okay with it, but learning they are hurting you could motivate them to change their approach. Give them room to grow after they hear you out.","Learning a family secret could be liberating for you at this time. While this specific issue might have been shameful or scandalous in the past, it may be viewed in a different light now. Either way, you might feel less alone in your own struggles knowing that people have always had some sort of drama going on. Although you could be tempted to blame someone else if you're feeling troubled, examining your personal outlook to see what you might be suppressing or judging unfairly could help you break this cycle.","An interpersonal conflict may be weighing on you now. Talking to friends about it could be helpful, but they might also call you out on your own contributions to the problem. While this may not be what you want to hear, accepting their perspective could ultimately help you think about your situation in a way that gives you more power to do something about it. Even if you can’t control the person you have an issue with, seeing you make an effort could inspire them to do the same."
2021-10-13,"Emotional manipulation could be more overwhelming than usual today when the martyred Moon joins forces with powerful Pluto. We may not even have the will to confront this sort of problem directly as the assertive Sun is blocked by sensitive Neptune. Chipper Venus, however, makes a friendly sextile with secure Saturn at 3:26 pm EDT, so we might have the internal stability to go around whoever is whipping up all the turmoil and just do what we need to do out of their sight.","An authority figure like a boss or a parent may be wielding guilt trips to control you today. The more you idealize this person, the more room they could have to exploit you. Thankfully, your friends can be a great resource for you to get a reality check about what is a reasonable request. At the same time, if they have been hearing your stories about this person for a while, they might also hold you accountable for your own contribution to the situation.","Although you may have felt manipulated into holding certain intellectual or spiritual views out of fear in the past, you can turn things around now by finding a leader who has a more relaxed attitude toward the mysteries of life. The breathing room this person gives you can come as a relief, yet you might be reluctant to disrupt the peace by asking too many questions. They may have a looser attitude toward details than you are used to, but they should still be able to answer your inquiries with honesty.","Someone you are entangled with may be using the threat of withholding things from you to get you to do what they want. Refining your own beliefs about what constitutes a healthy partnership can guide your decision about how to handle this situation. If it becomes obvious that you're able to take care of yourself without whatever it is they're keeping from you, the other person may get a clue that they need to find a different way to work things out.","Your idea of what your home life should be might differ from its current reality, and you may be tempted to use manipulation to get the people you live with to fill in the gaps. However, you're better off putting in practical work to maintain the space and resources you share, because this can remind you of the things you have to appreciate and be grateful for already. From a foundation of love, you can negotiate with others to make whatever adjustments are truly needed.","You might be suspicious that the boundaries in one of your close relationships are not what they should be. You can try to investigate this further by seeing whether the other person respects your decisions about your personal wellness, such as diet or other health matters. Their manipulative speech may be subtle, but you can tell when something feels off. If they just can’t let it go that they think you should have handled something differently, you might have to address bigger issues of respect in this relationship.","It might be difficult for you to hold on to your money today if someone important to you is in need. Whether this is your own child or someone else who seems dependent like a child, your protective instincts may be hard to turn off. While this person’s request for help could be legitimate, asking them to put in some practical work in exchange for your assistance may be healthy for your relationship with them. A dynamic of victim and rescuer helps no one.","You may wonder why you should bother planning your own routine when someone in your home or family always seems to upend it anyway. While you may feel like your willingness to be flexible makes you liked, you'll probably be happier if you develop, communicate, and stick to boundaries about at least your highest priorities. Your resentment about present conditions is likely less of a secret than you think, so others could ultimately benefit from your clarity, too.","You can be a great advocate for something you really value today, as long as you know when to stop. Describing how a situation has emotionally affected you may be a powerful part of speaking up for what you need. Crossing the line into manipulation is a risk, however, if you pound hard on blaming others for your problems. While you are not required to heal from your wounds immediately, try to focus on what specifically people can do to improve things right now.","People you know might admire your logical way of thinking, but they could be surprised to discover that you are also equipped to resolve problems that defy rationality. Your most useful trick at this time may be a flexible idea of what constitutes currency. While money might not motivate someone you're trying to get through to, see if you can find out what else they are willing to exchange for the goods or services you need.","It might be hard to resist going off on an emotional rant in public today, as you feel like your grievance is so important that the ends justify the means. Be careful not to get in your own way, though. Things could actually be developing behind the scenes in the direction they need to go -- which could, surprisingly, turn out to be better than the direction you want them to go -- and loudly demanding an immediate resolution could jeopardize that progress.","If you don’t know what you value, you might be willing to accept a philosophy that doesn’t help you get it. You may be more vulnerable than usual to subtle manipulation now, and your intellectual nature could work against you if it leads you to disregard your capacity for intuition. Your friends, however, may help keep you grounded. Their unfiltered reaction when you tell them about a hot new idea could be what you need, even if it isn’t what you want.","Sharing the most intense things on your mind with your social network might be risky at this time, as it could result in you being misunderstood and having your words twisted against you. You may be less disappointed if you can admit to yourself that some people don’t WANT to understand anything that doesn’t fit their agenda, and this is their loss. Keep your treasures safe for those who are truly interested by staying quiet and practicing discretion for now."
2021-10-14,"Even if the truth isn't all we want it to be, acknowledging it can help us plan our path forward today. As the emotional Moon joins with serious Saturn in logical Aquarius at 4:54 am EDT, we might seem a little cold, but we're just trying to find a path to security that will actually work. Fortunately, the Moon also interacts harmoniously with friendly Venus, sensitive Chiron, and thoughtful Mercury, so we're able to take a variety of perspectives into account.","Your friends may be on your side, but the way they express it might not be very warm and fuzzy right now. They could confront you about a difficult dynamic in one of your relationships that they can see more clearly than you can. Of course, your friends can't live your life for you, and there may be other components of your situation that are out of their view. That said, considering their insights will likely help you make your own decisions about how to move forward.","Clarity could melt away any fog over your goals and ambitions today, especially when it comes to the practical work it'll take to make them happen. You might get the support you need from others to do so as well. However, this progress may not make you as happy as you thought it would. Making a commitment, even to something you want, can tie you down. It might be necessary to acknowledge the loss of freedom that can come with any gain in stability.","Having a clear view of the world and how you believe you fit into it could be comforting for you at this time. Still, your friends or community members may not see everything the same way you do. While you might insist that your opinions are an important part of your self-expression no matter who gets hurt, try to make room in your philosophy for compassion in your relationships. Human life may be more complex than any ideas are able to contain.","Putting reality before your emotions is key today, particularly if you have to negotiate or revise an agreement where you share resources with other people. While you may question your identity if you don't act like your usual nurturing self, the others involved may actually respect you more when you stand up for your own interests. Although a success here could trigger feelings of regret about past situations where you were less assertive, don't let these concerns hold you back now. Learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward!","A key relationship in your life may not seem very comforting at the moment, but you could still feel secure based on the knowledge that the other person isn't going anywhere. This lack of emotional charge could even be surprisingly refreshing, as it can help you communicate more clearly with them. Even so, your passionate side is not going to go away just because this person isn't equipped to deal with it. Try to make sure you have some kind of creative outlet for expressing all of yourself.","Being fairly compensated for your work is important, and today you may be able to clearly see if some financial details aren't what they should be -- and be driven to do something about it. It could be time to acknowledge that a situation isn't what you hoped for or to admit that you feel let down by others from whom you expected better. Although these realizations can be painful, they can also motivate you to take positive action. Be honest about what you really need to feel secure.","You might have an opportunity right now to reveal a deeper part of yourself in a developing companionship. Maybe this juncture has challenged you in your past connections, as it can be tempting to throw yourself in too deep. Fortunately, you gain experience each time, so you're probably getting better at expressing yourself in a way that has enough boundaries to keep everyone secure. As you tell your story with just the right amount of passion, take a moment to marvel at how much you have grown!","A cleaning project at home could be daunting at the moment, and you might feel bad that you let things get this out of hand. Happily, once you get into it, you may really enjoy any hidden treasures you find. Uncovering and remembering these artifacts could give you some beneficial insight on your past. Plus, you may now be better equipped than ever to set up an organization system that makes your belongings more accessible in the future.","It may feel like a positive light is shining on you in your community today. You could find yourself doing a lot of talking with people there. However, you also might be acutely aware that the pleasure you get from this group comes with some limits on your self-expression. While you may wonder if you'd feel freer elsewhere, you might have a better time where you already are if you set more realistic expectations for the people around you. Boundaries are probably inevitable wherever you go!","Counting up your money right now may be stressful, as it might remind you of times when you didn't have enough to meet your needs. Still, these feelings and memories can be necessary for helping you make realistic plans to achieve your goals. Once you do a thorough inventory of all your resources, you may discover some that you had forgotten about! Going so quickly from feeling poor to feeling rich can show you how important your attitude is to your finances.","Your friends could respond well to you at this time, even if you come across as a little cold. They might be glad that you're the one who's willing to put things in rational and logical terms, while they get credit for looking more sympathetic. While some amount of division of labor is inevitable in life, be aware of whether your role in your social group is really working out for you. Try to avoid doing anyone's dirty work other than your own!","Remembering any inhibitions you forgot you had can help you today, as they may be unconsciously holding you back. Perhaps you internalized the messages of stern authority figures long ago, but now you're starting to understand that the powerful people who are in your life these days see things differently -- even if you already knew on some level that times had changed. You may feel betrayed if you've been valuing obedience all this time for its own sake, so you might need to reconsider your values going forward."
2021-10-15,"An optimistic view can make whatever challenges we face more bearable. Today, as the ever-rising Sun forms a harmonious trine with expansive Jupiter at 7:46 am EDT, we can have faith that we are part of something bigger than ourselves. Meanwhile, the social Moon in Aquarius helps us link with each other as she unites with Jupiter and connects kindly with the Sun and assertive Mars. When we put our heads together, we can get the best of what each person has to offer.","There may be conflict in one of your close relationships today, especially if you rely on that person for a lot of your social interaction. The root of the contentious energy might simply be that no one person can meet all of your needs. Reaching out to a different friend -- perhaps one you haven't heard from in a while -- could be rewarding for everyone involved. You need excitement in your life, and it's hard to get that from someone you see very often.","Hard work can result in major progress toward your ambitions at this time. You may put a lot of effort into getting the details correct in your day-to-day duties, and you can help yourself stay motivated by finding emotional satisfaction in the way these small things bring you closer to a major goal. An expression of appreciation from an authority figure could especially warm your heart. Even if you have your own reasons for doing what you do, being seen can be comforting.","While you could have plenty of energy needing an outlet here on Earth, today in particular, you may crave the emotional security of connecting with something on a grander scale. Finding a way to bring your spirituality into your creative expression or using your creativity in your spiritual practice can both be very rewarding for you at the moment. You might be much better off honestly acknowledging the magnitude of your needs than expecting anyone else to be able to satisfy them for you.","Your home life could be full of conflict now, but it's possible that the underlying problem is simply too much energy with no place to go. Try to convince whoever you live with to help you channel all that intensity into completing a task that you've both been putting off for a long time. Whether you take on a physical project around the house or focus on important domestic paperwork of some sort, finishing it together can improve household morale and fill you with pride.","Initiating a big conversation in one of your close relationships could go quite well for you right now. Asserting yourself and your needs, even if you worry that doing so would make the other person upset, is an important part of getting the respect you deserve! If you can express any anger you may have without being aggressive, the other person can then handle it more easily. Their response could make you feel heard and maybe even solve whatever problem you had.","Having a positive experience with a diet or health practice could make an impact on your values, as you work to understand the bigger picture of how you achieved these results. While it's normal to be excited about something that's made a helpful difference in your life, be careful to respect everyone else's boundaries as you embrace your newfound clarity. Focus on how good you feel instead of how wrong you think they might be, and you never know -- they may come to you for guidance!","You may feel like it takes a lot of energy for you to carve out your own identity, and wonder if it would be less effort to just keep your head down and go with the flow. Try to stick with it! You could be surprised at how vigorous you feel after asserting yourself. Constantly holding back anything potentially contentious consumes more energy on an ongoing basis than you may realize. With that burden lightened, you might feel both re-energized and liberated.","Positive changes could be noticeable today in the environment and people around you. It might be time for you to start a conversation about a family secret, especially if you are struggling with anger and resentment about it. Even if previous discussion attempts didn't go well, some constructive growth may make the process much smoother this time. Someone could finally respond with the nurturing and compassion that was needed long ago. You can't change your family's past, but you can build a kinder future.","A community you belong to could be downright chaotic right now, but you may know just the right words to soothe any conflict. While you can take pride in your ability to nurture others, you don't need to worry that your peacemaking will always be a one-sided effort. Sometimes it just takes one person to intentionally change the tone of a whole group. Your positive example may influence others to speak more thoughtfully, which will make things more comfortable for you and everyone else.","Your hard work in your career could result in financial gains at this time. More than that, you may finally feel enough financial security to plan for your future. These opportunities might tug on your heartstrings, bringing up memories of what it was like to not have enough in the past. Let this inspire you to be generous with others in the present! If you continue to approach your resources with gratitude such as this, you'll likely be rewarded for a long time to come.","You may enjoy seeing yourself as a defender of your philosophy today. While you might have good ideas, watch out for becoming a little too intense. The more emotional your arguments become, the more you may need to chill out. If trying to reform everything becomes too overwhelming for you, you could actually have better luck doing something nurturing for your own body. This reminder that you're human and a part of the real world can help you keep the proper perspective you need.","Digging deep into some complicated finances can go surprisingly well for you today. Even if you initially worry that you're poking the metaphorical bear, its growl could be much worse than its bite! Something that was previously hidden in this situation could turn out to be good for you. Still, you may need to use discretion to benefit as much as possible from this. Another person involved who seems intimidating might simply want privacy, and they could be very helpful -- as long as they get that."
2021-10-16,"Quiet might be hard to find today, but we likely won't be troubled by loneliness either. Chatty Mercury forms a friendly sextile with relaxed Venus at 9:24 pm EDT, so pleasant conversation may be more compelling than our responsibilities. Venus also connects with intense Chiron, so we might not avoid even difficult topics. This could at times shake our sense of security, as the sensitive Moon squares Venus, but our challenges can be easier to bear when we know we're connected.","A fast-paced conversation about an important topic may have you feeling intellectually stimulated. When you talk with one other person rather than in a big, intimidating group, you might discover that you can keep up with a complex issue better than you expect. This could help you heal any old worries about not being smart enough. With your confidence raised, you might enjoy reinforcing what you learned by researching it more on your own. It's OK to be proud of yourself!","Paying attention to detail in your work or other responsibilities could help you or someone else financially today. You might be able to catch and fix a hidden problem before it causes more damage. While it would be valid to feel proud of this achievement, try to resist the temptation to brag. Handling your satisfaction quietly is probably better, as whoever caused the problem might be embarrassed about it and afraid of being judged by others. Instead, focus on helping everyone move forward together.","Misunderstandings could have been common lately, as you may feel like you're on the wrong side of a social dynamic in a large group or community of yours. You might worry that you're being misinterpreted whenever the whole gang gets together, but you may get a fairer hearing if you talk to another group member one on one. Whether or not they're able to intervene on your behalf, they can probably give you needed insight on what motivates the approach of the group's leadership.","You're capable of executing beautiful plans for home improvement today. At some point, though, you might have to get your logical brain out of the way and let your intuition take over. You could sense the energy of where something should go, even if you can't explain exactly why. Watching this lead to a great result can help you heal from past experiences when you were shamed for not being methodical enough. While intellect is important, it isn't the best tool for every task.","Laughter may be music to your ears today, and your clever wit and funny jokes don't have to be shallow. A good joke can make an intelligent comment on a controversial subject, and you might get away with just that. As long as you have the sense to pick an audience that can take it, even the type of thing that usually gets glossed over because people are uncomfortable with some of its details is ripe for comedic skewering at the moment.","Sentimental feelings about your family relationships could provoke you to spend more money than you normally would at this time. You might even discover that nothing horrible happens when you're a little less fiscally disciplined than usual. This could help you see where your attitude toward money may need to relax. While you might be positively motivated to accumulate money for things like taking care of your relatives after you're gone, it's OK to take care of them while you're here too.","Your to-do list might not get done today, as building relationships may come much more easily. The way you talk with people right now can make them feel good, even if you don't shy away from harder topics. Opening up about your own story may encourage someone else to share theirs, which could be a healing encounter for both of you. Even if taking the time to bond slows down your productivity for the time being, it could be well worth the sacrifice.","Digging around in the hidden corners of your life could net you a financial boost, as you may find some money or other resources that you had forgotten about. Deciding what to do with the bonus might be harder! You may be tempted to blow it on a fun impulse purchase, as thinking of more responsible things to spend money on could bring up depressing topics. In the long run, however, being able to take care of yourself might be its own reward.","Looking good could intimidate you, as you might see the prospect of being attractive enough to get noticed as something that threatens your peace and security. Luckily, with your friends in your corner, you can find the strength to confront some of the inhibitions that are holding you back from expressing yourself. You can't guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen to you, but you can build a support network to cushion you against whatever challenges do block your path.","Exciting news about your professional or public life could be coming your way! That said, you may need to keep it quiet for now, perhaps while waiting for some details to be finalized. You might prefer to chew on this development in private before you bring others in on it anyway, as you may fear that those you tell will make your story all about them somehow. If you have long struggled with such a dynamic, this could be your opportunity to change it.","A mentally invigorating conversation with your friends or broader social network could be inspiring but challenging for you right now. You may have to weigh your values against the possibly complicated fun you can have when hanging out with those whose views differ from yours on some important topics. Learning to navigate disagreements with kindness and respect might be your most important lesson today! Happily, you -- and others -- could be surprised by how well you perform on the test.","In the public side of your life, you may be honored for your skillful handling of shared money or property. You might still be privately disappointed that things don't seem to go as smoothly for you when you try to manage your own resources. Objectively assessing the needs of others does mean that you don't have to worry about the details of your own issues. However, you can still try and find a way to channel for yourself the competence you have when helping others."
2021-10-17,"The truth demands our attention today, but it could have competition. The optimistic Sun makes a challenging square with restrained Pluto at 8:12 am EDT, showing where our ideas could break when confronted with reality. The emotional Moon in Pisces does unite with manipulative Neptune, so whoever cries the loudest still might get what they want. The Moon also sextiles Pluto, so we may acknowledge the facts at least privately, even if it doesn't feel safe to do so out loud yet.","A power struggle in a close relationship could hinge on determining which one of you is the authority and whose expertise gets to be the final, definitive word. While credentials and achievements can be important, something may seem to be missing as you tally up all the points. You might want to try looking at the situation from a spiritual perspective, where factors beyond earthly accomplishments are also considered. Remember that each person is the authority on their own experience.","Your approach to health matters may be held back by ideas from others that are out of date or even subtly destructive. Even if all of your friends are in agreement with a prominent health guru, you must trust your experience of your own body. It can be hard to work up the confidence to defy someone with more official credentials than you do. Remind yourself that you know when you feel good and when you don't, and sometimes it's that simple!","Expectations in a growing relationship may be hard for you to manage at this time. While you might have fun with someone, you could also be hoping for a deeper connection than they intend to give you. Even if they're trying to tell you that, your own wish for nurturing may stop you from hearing them clearly. Alternately, you could be the one leading the other person on, accidentally or otherwise. Either way, be careful to avoid assuming things instead of really communicating.","Ideas of how your home or family should look may be very powerful in your mind right now. Though manipulating those around you so they line up with your vision might be tempting, they are human and may resist or rebel if they feel like you don't respect them. Try to tell them what's on your mind as openly as you can. Even if you're embarrassed that some of your details are a little vague, they could really respect your honesty.","Someone may be acting like you can do no right as you go about your routine responsibilities. Alternately, you may develop this sort of critical attitude toward another person. Either way, instead of getting stuck in the details of any petty complaints, you should directly ask whoever is being critical what they DO want. It could turn out that they're just looking for connection but don't know how to ask for it openly. Intentionally engaging with them might reduce their desire to seek negative attention.","Someone else's impulse financial decisions could be making an impact on you at this time, whether or not you'd be interested in taking certain risks yourself. You may need to watch for subtle drains like that on your finances. Something initially drew your practical self to connect with such an impulsive person, though. If you intentionally explore your own potential to be a free spirit instead of vicariously living through this other person, that could positively shift your dynamic with them.","Your family could be limiting your freedom in some way right now. While you might be frustrated with their demands, it may also be obvious that they legitimately need your help with a practical task. Once you start on the job, it will probably take longer than you think -- not because anyone was intentionally dishonest, but because the problem was bigger than anyone realized. If you let yourself become totally immersed in solving it, you might at least forget how irritated you are!","A secret could be burning a hole in you, but you might have valid reasons to be avoiding sharing it at the moment. You may be able to get the best of both worlds if you tell your truth in a creative or metaphorical way. This could let you relieve the pressure you feel holding everything inside and keep enough distance from your actual drama to reduce the likelihood of offending someone. Focus on exploring your emotional experience rather than the facts of what happened.","Your social life may be fun, but it could also be costing you -- and not only in terms of your friends choosing activities that strain your budget. There might be deeper tension where you feel like you must hold back your thoughts on values that are really important to you. While there might still be enough good in these connections to justify riding out any frustrations, you may need a comfortable place at home where you can be more relaxed and open.","The way you choose to communicate may not be entirely tied to the facts at the moment. While you might have some valid points, you could feel more comfortable resorting to emotional manipulation to cover any gaps in your knowledge than admitting that there are some things you don't know. You may feel like this approach serves your interests, but it could blow up on you if others get sick of it. Use your intuition to read the room, and know when to back off!","Pushing yourself to be honest about the cost of things you want could be important for you now. Having an optimistic view of the world isn't a bad thing! However, you're likely to run into resistance seemingly out of nowhere if you haven't thought through what you're really asking of people when you want them to go along with your ideas, however brilliant. Try to acknowledge the parts of reality, such as the cost of a project, even if you don't like it.","Profound insights about issues that might be of life and death importance could come to you today, but they may conflict with your community's ideals. It might be possible for you to use genuine emotions to talk down any naysayers, but tapping into intense feelings like this comes with great responsibility -- not to mention the potential of humiliation. You can only pull this off successfully if you commit to going all in, so make sure it's truly warranted before you do so."
2021-10-18,"Life may begin to move forward today as Mercury Retrograde, an infamous time of delays and frustrations in communication and technology, finally ends at 11:17 am EDT. Ambitious Jupiter also ends its retrograde period and forms an encouraging trine with energetic Mars, where both are eager to take significant action and push powerfully into the future. The emotional Moon makes a stable sextile with practical Saturn, so we might have the sense to use some moderation if our goals get too inflated.","A community or large group of yours may have a prominent role as a unit in your life, but today you might want to develop your one-on-one relationships with individuals in the group. Revealing more of yourself can help you connect, but you may have to maintain a balance between your desire for connection and the tone of the community. Things could get awkward if your levels of intimacy are very different from the group's norms. With good boundaries, you should be fine!","Problems at work, particularly ones you've been chewing on for some time, can get solved today. While those in power likely appreciate your persistence, the way they congratulate you may be more private than public, at least for now. The skills you developed in addressing this challenge, however, are yours to keep -- regardless of what anyone else does. Your growing confidence in your competence can help you find the best path forward to the next stage of your career.","Adventure and excitement may be on your mind now, but you might not be able to get as much of them as you want today. Luckily, you can still work with your friends to plan something fun for the future. While you could have a clear view of the big picture, they might be more tuned in to the little details that will really make your experience something special. Just talking about all of this could be almost as fun as the real thing!","You may finally start to make progress on a frustrating home or family issue involving money or property today. Trying to do too much too soon could backfire on you, unfortunately. The emotional sensitivity of a parent or other authority figure might be a factor in the situation, so you may need to match your pace to what this person is comfortable with. Slowing down can also give you more space to think about your own emotional experience, so embrace this opportunity!","Talking through big plans in a close relationship can go well for you at the moment. You might be more interested in figuring out how to get things done than in feeling warm and cuddly, but that probably doesn't come from a place of being insensitive. Understanding the larger context of your situation may simply give you a quiet sense of security, and you want to clearly see how the actions you want to take right now will help you get more of that.","The possessions you treasure may require a frustrating amount of maintenance at this time. You might think of a particularly demanding item as an investment that will make you more money later. Even if you're right, be honest with yourself about whether or not the way you're handling the situation is sustainable for you today. Ask yourself if what you expect to get in the future is enough to justify what you're spending now. Don't forget -- time is money too!","Getting the balance right as you try to express yourself could be hard for you today. While you might frequently hold things back to keep the peace, a moment that feels right for opening up could have you spilling your concerns openly. Afterward, you may worry that you went too far or said too much. You may not be able to see clearly how you come off to others. Consider talking to someone you trust to get their take on the situation.","Cleaning up at home might be important for you today, as you could really benefit from having a comfortable place to sleep. If a steady pace of activity is marching along in your daily life, you may want to stop and think about it. Giving yourself permission to do that while you're awake can be hard, though, especially if responsibilities call your name. Sleep could be an opportunity for your dreams to process all of the information and experiences you've taken in lately.","You might be talking a lot with your friends today, but there could be another whole conversation going on inside your head as you overthink the details of every little chat. While there is value in listening to the more cautious side of you, you can also trust yourself -- especially when it comes to communication -- more than you currently do. You're probably more successful than you think you are at expressing yourself in a way that's comfortable for everyone involved.","A professional matter that has been delayed could be moving forward now, and you may wind up with more clarity regarding both your job title and your compensation. You can be more ambitious than usual in negotiating about money at this time, but don't let your desire for security overwhelm your thoughts. Remember to fairly assess whether an offer you receive is reasonable. Be realistic about what you truly need from an opportunity to succeed, as overestimating and underestimating both have their problems.","Broadening your current perspective doesn't have to involve exotic pursuits or complex subjects. If you want to sharpen your intellect in a way that would really help you right now, you could focus on learning more about things you might take for granted, like your body or how you communicate. Who you are as an individual matters, even if the world's problems seem more compelling. Paying attention to your own subtle quirks can be the key to having a much greater understanding of many things.","Your patience may be rewarded today, as you work out some complicated money drama that could have been dragging on for a while. Now that the end of the road is at least visible, you might benefit from examining your own motivations before you nail down the finishing touches. You may be pursuing this issue because you think your desired resolution will leave you with a better sense of security, but be aware that there are some holes no amount of money can fill."
2021-10-19,"We may blurt out our thoughts as quickly as they come to us today. These outbursts could hit each other's sore spots. The emotional Moon in Aries opposes inspired Mercury at 1:26 am EDT, so we could tend to take things personally, especially as the Moon also meets sensitive Chiron. As Luna forms a helpful trine with fortunate Venus, however, the frustrations of the moment may later work out. Still, Venus also challenges visionary Uranus, so innovation might not be appreciated right away.","You might be easily wounded by any statement where it seems like someone else is pointing out your physical flaws today, even if that isn't necessarily what they meant. Your own ideas of what looks good and how you want to maintain your body may be shifting, and the process of adjusting to these changes could have some difficult moments. Try to keep your feelings about this complicated journey separate from whatever anyone else says. They probably don't know the whole story.","Hitting a roadblock of hidden sensitivities may interfere with your drive to get a lot done in your work today. That said, if you take some time to pay attention to what comes up, you could learn a lot. The conflict might not really be about whatever petty thing ignited it. Deeper issues, such as feeling like you must choose between shared intimacy and your own development, could be at stake. Try to talk it out -- maybe you can have it both ways!","Friends and peers could seem easily offended today. You might think you're just expressing yourself and not realize how disruptive your words can be. To identify the battles that are truly worth fighting, you might need to intentionally choose between keeping the peace and getting others to agree with you. You can have calm in your relationships -- at the cost of not getting everything else you want. Remember that you usually can't get everything you want, no matter what you do.","The inconsistency of an important authority figure may feel hurtful today. As you work to satisfy them, you might be doing your best to keep track of the details of their requests. Meanwhile, they could keep changing their mind about what they want! Seeking advice from someone else outside the drama may help you get perspective on whether the demands being made of you are reasonable. Getting some external validation that you're in an unwinnable situation might be a big relief.","An authority figure may help you identify some of your beliefs that could be blocking you from expressing yourself. No matter how much you admire this leader, your most important lesson now may be learning to listen to your inner voice. Your limiting beliefs probably first developed when you were pressured into letting someone else's point of view upstage your own experience. You can honor a good teacher by using their wisdom to move forward, not by becoming dependent on them.","Someone may seem like they're pouting or throwing a fit to prevent you from candidly discussing money with them. You might feel like you have to choose between having a peaceful environment and getting the information you want. Keep in mind that sometimes people shut down when they feel overwhelmed, and this isn't necessarily a personal attack against you. See if you can narrow your quest down to the information you truly need right now -- they may respond better to more focused questions.","You may feel drawn to initiate a conversation with someone else about how they've hurt you, and you could get what you want in terms of making this conversation happen. Once it starts, though, you likely won't be able to control where it goes. True dialogue needs at least two people, and there might be unresolved pain on both sides here. Regardless of how legitimate your issues are, only open this exchange if you can accept that you might need to make changes too.","Rest may be the best answer to worries, including ones that can make you feel bad physically as well as mentally. While money fears that are contributing to your stress could be easier to resolve than you think, a solution that will be a good thing in the long run might not make everyone involved happy at the moment. You may see that coming and be dreading it! Try to be at your physical best to ride out any emotional storms.","Benefits from a new health routine or diet could be starting to affect your life, but you might not be ready to explain this to others yet. Even if your friends mean well and are genuinely curious about your habits, their endless questions could irritate you now. Instead of snapping at them, try to be honest about your limitations. It's normal for the early phases of a new endeavor to be confusing, and doing it may be easier than talking about it at this point.","You may have the right to tell someone what to do, but that doesn't mean that you have to or should do so. Responsible use of your authority could require sensitivity to the needs of those you supervise. Taking the time to hear them out now may have more lasting benefits than pushing forward on your personal agenda would have. Even if you have to bend the rules a little bit, use your own judgment to quietly do the right thing.","A friend who really cares may take some extra time to try to unsnarl a misunderstanding that comes up in conversation with you today. Working with them on this might be more challenging for you than just walking away from the situation. While you may still be focused on the original intellectual argument on something such as politics or religion, what may need more attention is your human emotional reaction. Don't let your insecurities push away someone who's trying to help!","You might feel offended if someone asks you questions about your finances today. The words they're actually saying, however, may be different from the words you hear through the filter of your own shame. You might be caught up in bad experiences you had with authority figures judging you in the past. The person who's talking to you now could have something genuinely promising in mind for you, so do your best to stay grounded in the present moment with them."
2021-10-20,"Blunt honesty may be our way of satisfying an urge for aggression today. The emotional Moon in impulsive Aries tangles with red-hot Mars and powerful Pluto, so tension could easily escalate with any provocation. With the revelatory Full Moon happening in Aries at 10:57 am EDT, however, simply telling the truth may pop a growing balloon of simmering anger. When the Moon moves into calmer Taurus later in the day, engaging with whatever is physically real can bring some perspective to the drama of heated egos.","A power struggle in one of your relationships could be hard for you and the other person to see clearly today. While you might appear to be overly emotional, perhaps they are goading you and getting away with it in a way that makes you look like the problem. They may, however, be using this technique to distract you from the real issues. If you can insist that you both keep your attention on the practical or physical facts of the matter, clarity might come.","You may have a lot of energy for getting things done today. Still, some of your vigor could get diverted by your temptation to convince others of the One True Way -- yours, obviously -- to carry out a particular task. If you must go this route, tell them your grievance directly instead of sneaking around behind their backs to redo their work. You might learn there was a valid reason why they did it the way they did in the first place.","A risky investment could be appealing to you now, but the reality of the situation might be more complex than the hype; there may be manipulation, strings attached, or just bureaucratic hassles that are not readily apparent. Though the benefits could turn out to outweigh the drawbacks, don’t let peer pressure push you into anything you're not sure of. An opportunity that is really worth pursuing will still be there after you take the time to do your research.","Your eagerness to take action on home-related matters could be met by resistance from your family or other people you live with. While you may struggle to understand how they don’t see the need to maintain the household with the same urgency you do, you might have to respect that their priorities are not necessarily the same as yours. If you want company while you tend to your chores, friends might be willing to help, but when you work alone, you can do things just the way you want.","Solving a problem at work might require you to honestly talk through some cultural differences with your colleagues. You may be tempted to demand your own way because what you want seems like the obvious choice from your perspective. However, taking extra time to make sure that others feel included and accommodated can help you build alliances that will be important to the growth of your career. Even if you still have your own preferences, you know you can’t do everything by yourself.","A money issue could be especially stressful right now because someone else is playing on your sympathy. You may be afraid to stand up to them because they wear their suffering on their sleeve, but if you resent what you are being asked to give, this will come out no matter how much you try to hide it. Your greatest conflict might be with your own beliefs about what you must do to be a good person, and once you solve that, dealing with others may be easier.","Although you may feel like it's time to assert yourself in a close relationship, the other person could respond with things they have been meaning to get off their chest, too. While you, as the initiator, have had time to think through your strategy, they might be surprised and react impulsively. Though a complicated confrontation isn't what you're looking for, try to be patient. If you can endure the mess of hard feelings, you may ultimately get the understanding you crave.","You may feel a valid reason to hold back certain information from others, but if you become aware that this is interfering with something important getting done, you might need to change your approach. The people whose reactions you are afraid of could be kinder than you think, because they are aware that your honest input is necessary to solve the problem. When you all set aside personal grievances to focus on the task at hand, your relationships may improve as an added bonus.","Arguments in your social circle could get heated at this time, and people might be surprised to discover that your views on a hot-button topic are not what they expected. They may, however, be impressed if they can see that you put your money where your mouth is. Demanding social change of one kind or another is common, but living out the change you want to the point that it costs you is rare and admirable.","Your progress toward your ambitions may be moving along so well that it could be hard to admit you need some downtime at home to do your own thing. Still, you are better off acknowledging this and giving yourself permission to relax rather than pushing yourself to work through your fatigue. Your work is strongest when your heart is in it, and you can come back to it with renewed strength and passion after you take a refreshing break.","Though you may tend to assume that everyone around you shares your politics, you could be surprised today to discover that someone you interact with does not. You might feel betrayed not so much because of what they believe, but because you found out they kept it from you for a long time. Still, you may need to consider whether you contributed to this secrecy. If you give others the feeling that you are not a safe person to open up to, they will protect themselves accordingly.","A money issue may be frustrating for you at this time, as you might feel that someone who is more powerful than you is pushing you around. However, realizing that this conflict is likely part of a bigger societal problem may actually be comforting to you now, as it allows you to feel less alone in your struggle. Talking to other people who have dealt with similar challenges can help you decide how to move forward."
2021-10-21,"Even painfully disruptive change can have its beautiful moments today. As the security-seeking Moon in Taurus meets shocking Uranus at 6:28 pm EDT, we may find that the things we rely on for stability are shaken. The Moon also squares authoritative Saturn, so we might be disappointed by how those in power handle a disturbance. Thankfully, thoughtful Mercury and hopeful Venus press on the Moon to find a new path forward. After we learn what doesn't work, we can look for what does.","Longtime social relationships of yours may be cooling right now, as it becomes increasingly obvious that you aren't in the same place as the other person is on some major issues. Though you might mourn the good parts of what you're losing, try to be aware of any new connections that you're developing. Pursuing any adventures and learning opportunities that call to you can help you bring people who value the same things that you do into your daily life.","You might find yourself wandering off the beaten path today -- whether you want to or not -- as you could feel at odds with authority figures no matter what you do. Don't give up! If you can manage to improve the lives of others around you in practical ways in spite of any conflict, they may be interested in joining forces with you. Even though deferring to authority is often a deeply ingrained habit, people will likely be drawn to what gets real results.","A belief about the world that you may have been taking for granted could be restricting you, and you might finally realize this today. A loving relationship where you feel safe expressing yourself can give you space to talk about any conflict and decide how to move forward. As you discuss this, don't give in to the temptation to replace one limiting idea with another. Focus on what actually works in the physical realm, even if it pushes you to question some of your philosophies.","A dramatic news story could pull you out of a rut today. Even a comfortable routine of work and home life can feel oppressive if you have no other stimulation, so this news might be welcome. Though this problem in the larger world may remind you of some personally upsetting issues, it could signify that it's time to face those concerns head on and stop letting your regular activities distract you. You might not get the answers to everything now, but talking with friends can help.","Excitement could spark your enthusiasm for an innovative idea in your professional life, but an important person there -- whose approval you may crave -- might reject your idea without giving it the consideration you think it deserves. Try not to get too discouraged! Remind yourself that the world is bigger than their particular view of things, and let their criticism motivate you to express yourself clearly and address any missing points of your plan. This could really help you attract others who will support you.","Being productive and checking items off your to-do list might seem like the most important priorities for you today, but staying focused could be harder than you thought. An unexpected opportunity to do something physically or intellectually adventurous could be on its way to you. Your loved ones might be interested in pursuing this distraction with you -- they could show you that it's more affordable than you think. Learning something new would be a good accomplishment today, so go for it!","The desire to maintain a calm and collected image may conflict with your wish to deeply connect with someone else. As you can likely already see, this could potentially stir up some messy emotions. An actual conversation might surprise you by being less scary than you expected. While just seeing that it's possible for serious personal talks to go well could be helpful for you, you may also need to reflect further on where your fear of this kind of communication comes from.","You might have recently broken away from some aspect of your background that was holding you back. While you might be tempted to give a disruptive relationship all the credit for making waves like this, don't forget to credit yourself as well. Remember that people tend to attract others who are on the same wavelength. You could have held your suddenly public values privately for some time, even if letting the other person take the heat as the instigator sounds easier than admitting that does.","While you may be proud of some changes you've made to support your health lately, the people around you could be critical. They may ask questions that seem like they aren't really trying to understand, but are instead attempting to push you back to doing whatever is more common where you live. Those who actually understand your choices might have to be found elsewhere, like in an online community. Even if they're physically far away, they can make you feel less alone.","The financial impact of taking a risk might worry you at the moment, even if you can tell an opportunity you're considering could also help you move forward in your career. As you deliberate on your options, try to make sure you see the full picture of the situation before you react out of fear. There may be factors not easily visible that are working in your favor -- those could be making a calculated risk less dangerous for you now.","A lack of fun in your life may weigh on you at this time, especially if there are solid obstacles blocking your path to doing things that you normally consider exciting. You might, however, be able to get more adventure and community than you would have expected within your domestic life. Making an effort to appreciate the people you may take for granted can shift your perspective and help you see opportunities you have overlooked. They might be grateful to spend time together too!","A professional collaboration could push you to reveal something you'd normally keep to yourself, as you can probably recognize that the other person has a legitimate business reason for needing to know. While you might be ashamed of whatever you were hiding, a compassionate response from this person may shift your attitude about it. You don't have to flip to the other extreme of broadcasting this information, but learning that you don't have to feel bad about yourself can increase your confidence in general life."
2021-10-22,"We may be rational and practical to the point of ruthlessness today. As aggressive Mars squares destructive Pluto at 12:20 am EDT, working toward our goals may seem more important than worrying about who could get hurt. Meanwhile, the emotional Moon's goading square to exuberant Jupiter could encourage us to push past our limits. If we can bring ourselves to stop and think, the Moon's harmonious trine with transformative Pluto can still bring us insight into the power dynamics in our lives.","Making decisions in a close relationship could be difficult at this time, as the two of you may be tempted to tussle over who has the power to make the final call. Try to keep in mind the shared values and ideals that bind you together. This might remind you that you and the other person are working toward the same goal, even if your approaches differ. Seeing them as a peer rather than an enemy can help you both choose the common good.","You may run into a conflict with the law -- or with a busybody who's decided that they're the law's personal representative -- in the course of your work today. Thankfully, the actual relevant authority figure might have more sympathy for your side of the story than whoever instigates the issue does. As long as you don't try to push the boundaries to demand more than your fair share of consideration, you can emerge from any drama without lasting damage.","An adventurous financial move may appeal to you now, but there could be some friction if you take this risk using resources you share with others. Even if you think the potential reward is great enough to justify going behind their backs just this once, your secrecy may not be as subtle as you think it is! You're likely to get caught. You can, however, direct your energy toward researching your potential investment so you can make its case to others openly.","A relationship conflict you have at home or with family may seem difficult to deal with, but your friends, who've perhaps been hearing about it for a while, could have helpful insights for you. A dynamic that you're too deeply embedded in to recognize might be more obvious from a distance. Even as you take in your friends' perspectives, try to maintain some boundaries in what you tell them. No matter how mad you are at your opponent, some things should stay private.","Workplace gossip could get out of hand at the moment, and it may be easy to cross a line from sharing information about a controversial matter into saying something hurtful. Staying focused on your larger career goals can guide you to the big picture, beyond the details of today's drama. You may still have a lot to say about your professional life, but do your best to direct your desire for connection toward building constructive relationships that can help you reach your goals.","Money may seem to talk loudly, particularly if you can't get people to take you seriously any other way. While you might succeed in getting others to do what you want in the moment by either giving or withholding resources, ask yourself if this is consistent with your internal philosophy. If an exceptionally tough situation truly needs such a rough approach, your lofty ideals could need to make room for this occasional reality. Building a lasting relationship probably still requires a gentler touch.","You may be ready to speak out against a family dynamic that is controlling or manipulative. Before you confront anyone, try to be aware of how you may benefit from the present arrangement, such as through gaining access to money or other shared resources. Though you could ultimately be capable of working out some changes to any agreement without abandoning it entirely, you may need to first be honest with yourself about what you might have accepted in exchange for your freedom.","You might feel like maintaining control over information is a way for you to achieve security. Unfortunately, the strain of holding in too many secrets can sap energy that you'd otherwise be able to use for different things. Look for a different kind of security by taking the risk of opening up to someone you trust. If you're pleasantly surprised by how well this goes, you might be tempted to divulge too much too fast, so be careful! Start small for now.","A distressing event in the news may motivate you to make an effort to be the change you want to see in the world. Finding a way to take concrete action can be an outlet for any intense emotions about the situation. It might also make discussing your views with others easier. While they may have avoided getting involved because they didn't know where to begin, asking them to do something specific with you is more likely to encourage them to help right now.","An authority figure may be goading you at this time. Being in any way dependent on them could be exacerbating the problem. Look for a way to do what you need to do by yourself without involving them to reduce any tension. You may have more resources available to help with whatever issue or project you're working on than you thought you did! Still, try to keep your inventory realistic and don't let your estimates get inflated by the excitement of the moment.","Being too pushy about your ideology might lead to you having more solitude than you thought you wanted right now, as people may decide they don't want to argue with you. On the other hand, some quiet rest at home could be just what you need. Taking some time to recharge can let you reconnect with a broader sense of yourself, one that's bigger than your views on any particular issue. You might still be right, but there's more to you than that!","Using your money to get your way in a community of yours could be tempting, but you might be making any conflict more complicated than it needs to be. Even if you're dissatisfied with what prominent members of the community have said in public, approaching them in private to talk further may go better than you expect. You might not get everything you want, but you could learn about other sides of the story or work toward a compromise that's better for everyone involved."
2021-10-23,"We may be able to skate through today smoothly, but the threat of conflict under the surface could be hard to ignore. The friendly Moon in communicative Gemini harmoniously trines structured Saturn, so we can express ourselves logically. However, the Sun enters powerful Scorpio at 12:51 am EDT, demanding we deal with our complex -- maybe even irrational -- emotions. The lighthearted Gemini Moon is an awkward match for the intense Scorpio Sun, but dark humor might help everyone adjust to the situation.","A big money issue may be on your mind at the moment, but you might not be ready to talk to anyone else about it yet. When it comes to a complicated topic like taxes or investing, a lack of confidence in your knowledge could get in the way of a productive discussion at this point. Researching topics like this online at your own pace may help you organize your thoughts enough to know what questions to ask and who could answer them.","Career and money matters may be working smoothly for you right now, and you could enjoy the predictable routine. However, an unpredictable personal relationship might demand attention and disrupt your calm. Consider asking yourself how this person came to be in your life in the first place. It could have been something involving opposites attracting, where you enjoyed their excitement and they admired your stability. Even if it used to be balanced, you may have changed over time. Make sure the relationship is still fair.","Your thinking may be clearer than usual today, and you might be justifiably proud of a particularly elegant solution you've developed for a challenge in your life. Unfortunately, putting your thoughts into action could be the hard part. Starting today, the Sun's transit through your service sector for the next month will emphasize working to make your dreams manifest in the physical world. Whenever reality confronts you with details you couldn't have thought of beforehand, calmly work through them one by one.","You may be proud of your ability to assess difficult issues rationally and calmly today. Regardless, it's still important for you to acknowledge if you've reacted more emotionally at other times in your life. This might help you maintain empathy for someone else who seems like they're taking a current upheaval harder than you are. Their expressiveness could also let you rediscover your own capacity for deep emotions. Returning to this ability after time away may reveal that it's changed for the better.","Social delights could fill your cup with fun today! However, your friends and acquaintances might only see the pleasing side of you, and not a more dramatic side that may come out with your family. While some amount of separation like this is probably inevitable, trying too hard to be chill and relaxed in public could leave you with more pent-up frustration to let out at home than usual. Maintaining both familial and friendly relationships might require you to hold back less as you socialize.","Your attention to detail in your daily tasks can truly support your larger ambitions at this time. Frustratingly, you might struggle to explain this to the people around you. If they don't understand the motivation behind what you're doing, they may feel like you're nitpicking for no good reason. You might not be able to make them agree with you right now, but keeping good boundaries for yourself could reduce the likelihood of your quirks affecting or further irritating them.","The personal growth you experience in your life journey might be going well enough that you know exactly the right educational course or adventure to get you to your next step. The prospect of paying for it may not be easy! Money issues may have some murkiness for you, especially if any of your emotional needs that don't fit your cool, collected image pile up there. Letting your emotions simply be emotions could give your money more space to just be money.","Family life can be very stable for you now. Even if there could be more emotional warmth, you're likely satisfied that the way you all share money or other resources seems to run smoothly. That said, as the headstrong Sun moves into your sign today, you may be challenged to focus more on your personal interests. If you feel like pulling away to do your own thing threatens your power within the family group, that might be exactly why you need to do it!","Communication in a close relationship can happen with clarity now. As the Sun's transit through your 12th House of Secrets starts today, the normally hidden parts of your life are emphasized. You might be more aware than usual of what you hold back even from those you trust. There may be valid reasons to keep some things private, but you should at least learn your own reasons. They may simply not be relevant to what you're dealing with now. Either way, make sure you know.","Your mindset toward money and your need to work for it could be quite serious at this time. Even so, the possibility of socializing and having fun could tempt you away from that prize as the Sun moves into your community sector. While your bonds with your friends are probably tight enough that they'll understand if you can't see them right now, figuring out how to make connecting with them a priority over the next few weeks would be a great idea!","Presenting yourself clearly may come easily to you now. While it's nice to have clarity about who you are and what you need, this could also reveal the areas where your current professional situation doesn't quite fit. Your expectations could be part of the problem, as some of your needs for self-expression may be better met in other areas of your life. If you can maintain a realistic attitude, you may be able to identify potential adjustments that could really make things better for you.","The comfort of your home may be at its best these days. Still, once you feel cozy in there, you might get a little bit bored. Fortunately, the Sun's transit through your 9th House of Expansion starting today could turn your attention toward some articles or books you've been meaning to read. Though distractions may make it hard to commit to settle down and read, finally sinking into the process can let you experience the thrill of learning something new without leaving your house."
2021-10-24,"We may be torn between thinking rationally and wandering sentimentally today. As the Moon in quick-thinking Gemini forms a harmonious trine with cerebral Mercury at 6:17 am EDT, we might be able to make clear plans. However, the emotional Moon also makes challenging aspects with popularity-seeking Venus and nebulous Neptune, so our desire to be liked by others may override our common sense. Precocious Mercury, meanwhile, is challenged by shocking Uranus, so unexpected circumstances could provide a way out of this dilemma.","A good conversation in a close relationship can help you see things more clearly right now. You might feel like the other person is pressuring you about money or your beliefs. Still, try to be honest with yourself if you're viewing those topics through rose-colored glasses at the moment. Any challenges you detect may not be coming from the other person, but from reality. While your worldview could give you a sense of security, the most reliable security comes from living the truth.","Working smart for your money may be getting you results you're proud of at this time! This newfound financial security might attract others who want some of your resources for themselves. If their big ideas for what you should do with your money don't sound right to you, you may need to tell them that directly. Though you could worry that they won't like you if you speak up, they'll likely benefit from a gentle reminder that they've crossed the line.","Explaining yourself may be easier than usual now, but giving yourself the permission to do so could be a challenge. The dynamic of one of your close relationships might be so potent at the moment that it's hard for you to think of your own interests because the needs of the relationship seem to be more important. Try to remember your goofiest quirks -- maybe even the ones you tend to hide -- to help you avoid losing yourself in the intensity.","It may be difficult to keep your feet on the ground and your head out of the clouds when it comes to beautifying your home today. If you're trying to follow ideas from a favorite decorating guru and just aren't getting the results you want, consider the possibility that their model isn't providing what you need to feel secure. Taking time to articulate your unique needs may require more research, but doing so can help you create an innovative solution that truly works for you.","The words might flow freely from you today, as circumstances could give you an opportunity to share more about your personal life than usual with your larger social network. While unburdening yourself might feel like a relief in the moment, weakening your boundaries too much could lead to saying things that you'll later regret. Try to keep your public image in mind! While that image may actually be due for an update, make sure it's a change for the better.","Seeing one of your close relationships clearly may be difficult for you right now. You might be so concerned about the way people outside the relationship view your connection that you lose track of what being a part of the relationship is actually like. Staying focused on the financial or material component of this connection could help you maintain a tether to reality. When you let the facts and figures show you what's really going on, you may discover an innovative solution to your challenges.","People may attempt to talk you into doing things beyond your usual responsibilities for them today. A longing for security could tempt you to give in to these requests, as you might think that complying with them will guarantee that you'll be liked. No matter which way you decide to handle this situation, you can take the opportunity to analyze your beliefs about your obligations to others. An interesting twist could be trying to identify what you believe are their obligations to you.","What you really want in life could be hard to see at the moment, leading you to spend money on things that might not be worth it. While having fun in the moment can sometimes be a worthy investment, you may benefit from pushing yourself to intentionally look at the bigger picture. You might be using up valuable resources on distractions because you're afraid to admit to your true desires. Seeking out a pep talk from someone encouraging could set you free to move forward!","A significant relationship in your life may look good on paper, but you could have some nagging concerns. Your friends might have a helpful perspective on any dynamics that you may be having trouble seeing clearly. Another way to get information would be paying attention to how the relationship makes you feel physically. If you're tense around the other person, that could signal trouble! On the other hand, if you feel comfortable, whatever you're concerned about might not be a threat after all.","Asking for what you want might be tricky at this time. You could be especially disappointed if you assume that doing good deeds for someone else means that they'll automatically figure out what you want them to do for you in return and that they'll actually do it. In the end, however, trying to manage the behavior of others may become less interesting if you do something for yourself that makes you feel good. Focus on the things that you can control!","Money may be no object when it comes to impressing your friends now. If you think your spending could be going too far, though, you might want to reflect on any messages you received in your upbringing about entertaining others. While pleasure has its value, no one benefits when you live beyond your means. There are likely ways to find adventures that don't overextend you financially, and being realistic about your limitations can help you find something that really works for you and your friends.","You may find yourself desired, both in your public role and in your home life. Acting vague about your own preferences could seem like it's helping you be everything to everyone, and you might take pride in that performance! A bureaucratic matter that forces you to put the real facts down on paper, however, may bring you back to reality. Corralling your complicated life into the boxes on a form could remind you in a comforting way that everyone -- including you -- has limits."
2021-10-25,"Big ideas are afoot as the connection-making Moon in clever Gemini trines both motivated Mars and exuberant Jupiter this morning. Emotional concerns could take precedence later in the day, after the Moon enters sensitive Cancer. By the time she trines the powerful Scorpio Sun at 10:54 pm EDT, we may find it easy to say how we feel. Luckily, our newfound pull toward security can help us refine the details of any recent brainstorms before we act them out.","Playing matchmaker may tempt you today, as you can see how a person in your life would benefit from meeting someone else you know. Whether any connection you want to make is professional or personal, take a moment to think through how the change you're considering might play out when it comes to the boundaries of your present social world. While something like combining friend groups or working with a family member can go well, the fallout might be disastrous if it doesn't.","Clarity could be coming to your professional life, as you begin to see how your daily duties help you progress toward your larger career goals. Whether or not you hope to make more money in the future, things could be working out well enough on that front at this moment. As these loose ends resolve, you might finally have the bandwidth to get through an overdue conversation with someone close. Your newfound confidence can support you in whatever else you need to work out!","The urge to explore may open the door to an intellectual adventure that really resonates with you right now. Figuring out how to get more of this pleasure in your life might be just the motivation you need to finally organize your finances or your schedule. When you can clearly see how having control over your money and time gives you room to pursue something you enjoy, you may have more patience for dealing with details that would otherwise seem boring or restrictive.","Unraveling family secrets could be compelling for you at this time. Though you may surprise even yourself with how hard you push, other people involved could also, for their own reasons, be more willing to share information now than they were in the past. If you make it clear that your motivation isn't to shame anyone else for whatever they feel bad about, but instead to better understand the influences that shaped your life, you might be able to get everything you need.","A sense of obligation could push you to reach out to different people on your contacts list and see how they're doing. While this type of maintenance can be a necessary part of keeping relationships going, remember to go for quality over quantity, and try to be aware of when you've done all you can handle for one day. One really rewarding or deep conversation could give you a lot to think about. It's OK to take some time to do so!","Money concerns may motivate you to work hard at the moment. While you do so, you might see a glimpse of a direction in which your career could grow. Running this idea by your peers could help you decide whether or not you want to pursue it further, as maybe a friend of a friend is doing something similar. You may also want to find more formal information online, but this sort of unfiltered personal experience can be very helpful in its own way.","You may be confident that the truth is on your side in an important matter, but it could be difficult for you to bring this attitude into a situation where you believe that maintaining your good reputation requires you not to rock the boat. That said, if you've been known to toe the line up to this point, people might recognize that you wouldn't speak up unless you had a truly important reason. There are no guarantees, but this context could justify your actions.","You might need to look at whether your ideas about independence are serving you at this time. While you may believe you should do everything on your own, it could become obvious to you that your family or other supporters are helping you quite a bit behind the scenes. As long as there aren't restrictive strings attached to their gifts, you don't have to feel bad about something that works for you. Even so, it's likely a good idea to acknowledge whatever arrangement may exist.","You could seem almost aggressively social with the people around you today if you aren't careful. As much as you may enjoy getting to know some of your acquaintances better, let your common sense tell you when to stop. Your sensitivity to the comfort of others could be heightened by your own recent explorations into heavier issues. Plus, a passing comment from someone you talk with might be all you need to inspire the next step of your introspective process. Listen carefully!","You may be passionate about your pursuit of professional status and the financial rewards it can bring you at the moment, and you might be willing to accept a challenging daily routine as the cost of achieving these goals. The hard part could come when the rules you set for yourself intersect with your commitments to others. If you're having trouble making time for your friendships or community groups, you may need to be honest with them about your current limitations.","How you fit into the grand scheme of things may be quite clear to you today, which could inspire some ideas about what should happen to make the world a better place. However, the petty chores of your daily life likely still need to be done! Finding a way to incorporate the causes you care about into any mundane responsibilities could make them more gratifying. If you come up with a particularly innovative way of doing so, you might even get some publicity for it.","The obvious resources in your life might not seem like enough to meet your needs right now. If you think outside the box, though, you may find that something like an old investment account you'd forgotten about or a new credit card promotion is able to patch whatever hole you're trying to fill. Making this discovery just in time could be a great relief, perhaps even one that restores your faith in the Universe. It might also inspire you to get a little more organized!"
2021-10-26,"Perfection may get in the way of reality today as idealistic Venus squares impractical Neptune at 9:06 pm EDT. Compounding that challenge, the sensitive Moon in Cancer tangles with touchy Chiron and harsh Saturn, so we might feel bad about our inability to live up to our own high standards. Luckily, the Moon also makes a friendly sextile with quirky Uranus in sensual Taurus. Pursuing what makes our bodies feel good, even if it's not what we expect, could relieve us of our worries.","You may be very sentimental about your spiritual beliefs at this time, making you eager to defend them against any perceived attack. The biggest threat to them, surprisingly, could come from your own more complex spiritual experiences. You might be loyal to some traditions that you know limit you because they give you security and a way to understand certain personal wounds. Still, you might need to look at whether this is really the only way for you to deal with those issues.","Someone in your social network may be seeking your financial backing at this time. Even if you're able to spare the funds they want, that might not be enough to make their idea work out like they think it will. Be realistic about whether you're capable of truly helping them! Saying your piece could be hard, particularly if you were taught to defer to others, but your candid feedback may be the best thing you can give them for now.","You may be tempted to connect with someone because you think associating with them will make you look more impressive to others. This could especially appeal to you if you feel like you need to make up for being dissed or treated unfairly in another social situation. While the person you're considering could be good for you in some ways, your interactions with them might go better if you can approach them with a sense of confidence in what you have to offer.","A professional disappointment could feel personal today. You may, however, have expectations that no job is capable of filling. You might believe that if you work hard enough, you can earn love from others. Don't let that hope could lure you into a situation where you're far more emotionally invested than the other person is. Your friends may be able to console you in general and help you by modeling a less intense way of relating. Life doesn't have to be this dramatic!","The guiltier you feel about self-care, the more trouble you might have focusing on anything other than your resentment of being pushed to justify your existence through continually being productive. You might as well intentionally plan on doing something that makes you feel good for now! As long as you don't neglect truly urgent commitments to others, most of your to-do list could probably wait a day to get done. After some downtime, you can return to whatever you need to do.","Your social life could be more of a burden than a joy, as today you might feel like everyone wants something from you. However, you may need to acknowledge your own contribution to this dynamic. If you believe that giving without restraint will make others love you, stepping back to let them work things out on their own could be scary. Fortunately, a pleasantly surprising outcome might help you update your relationship beliefs. You can't make people love you, but you can make your life easier.","Someone may try to talk you into a health or diet decision you might not otherwise make today. You may be tempted to give in to keep the peace, especially if they use their hurt feelings as leverage. This could make you feel resentful about being bullied, or even more deeply disappointed that this type of experience is what relationships often seem to be for you. Getting some space from whoever is bothering you might be more helpful than confronting them directly for now.","Feeling like you're stuck at home and can't get the adventure you crave could tempt you to take a financial risk for excitement. Instead, consider reaching out to someone you haven't talked to in a while, as that's something that may entertain you with less potential for disappointment. Specific health or diet matters could be a contentious topic -- maybe even the reason why you've been distant from this person! Instead, consider thinking about some ways to help with society's larger problems together.","You could be putting on a brave face even if the foundation of your life isn't as stable as you'd like it to be right now. Talking about your problems might be more frustrating than comforting at this point. Still, don't give up! You may be capable of taking some practical steps to move forward, and getting into an innovative arrangement to share some resources could really help you. You don't have to spill your guts, but you also don't have to do everything alone.","A fun secret may be occupying your thoughts right now, and being vague in your communication could help you keep it. Be careful, or you might cross the line into acting weird about it and create tension in one of your significant relationships. Figuring out what this person is specifically concerned about could guide you to disclose a limited amount of information to maintain peace for the time being. When they know that whatever they were worried about isn't happening, they may relax.","Being well regarded by friends or in your community could come with some costs for you today. You might feel like you need to keep your head down and stick to matters that aren't controversial rather than speaking your truth on the topics that really matter to you. While going along with this could be your best option at the moment, you may need to cultivate a more open atmosphere in your home life to compensate for any suppression elsewhere.","Avoiding contentious disputes may raise your social status at this time. As much as it might bother you to see someone else publicly saying things you think are wrong, confronting them could just cause more issues. Try approaching them for a private conversation later. That may be a more effective way of sharing your perspective and advancing your values. Even if they don't come to completely agree with you immediately, your kindness and discretion will likely make them think well of you."
2021-10-27,"We may be able to catch a glimpse of our future today as the intuitive Moon connects in a coordinated trine with visionary Neptune at 10:48 am EDT. Unfortunately, getting there might be fraught with misunderstandings and emotional drama, as the Moon also forms challenging aspects with nitpicky Mercury and manipulative Pluto. It could seem impossible to take action without stepping on someone's toes. However, pleasant Venus and lucky Jupiter nudge the Moon to help us find a path for this tension to eventually release.","Researching how others find security could be compelling for you today, and you may be eager to try some of the ideas you read about. In contrast to your enthusiasm, the people close to you might be skeptical. They may feel threatened for their own reasons that aren't about you, but they could also see some legitimate holes in your plans. You may need to think through what level of security is realistically achievable on Earth and find peace about the rest another way.","A bureaucratic hassle may be weighing you down, but paying attention to the details and following the rules step by step might finally get an authority figure who has the power to help you on your side. Whenever you succeed in solving your problem, you could have an important story to share with others. Seeing your friends use the lessons you learned from your experience to address similar challenges in their lives, may make you feel especially proud of your triumph.","You may idealize a powerful person in your life, perhaps due to the financial security they give you. However, if their gifts come with significant strings attached, the cost to your ability to freely express yourself might be too high. Spending time in a more balanced relationship could give you a taste of what you're missing. While you may not be able to extricate yourself from your current arrangement immediately, knowing what you really want can help you start working toward getting it.","Home or family frustrations could currently spark conflict in one of your significant relationships. You might ask yourself if dealing with the specific hassles or practical tasks that are allegedly the issue would end the turmoil. If such an easy resolution seems unlikely, you could have a broader sense that someone has let you down by not matching your standards for how people should act in relationships. Be clear on what you really want before you ask anyone else to give it to you.","Taking some time alone to reflect on an intense issue could sound wonderful today, as you probably want to work out some of the details of your perspective on your own before you share it with anyone else. Regardless of what you'd prefer, someone may want to talk to you about it now. You might need to identify some conditions under which you'd feel better about opening up. If the other person is able to meet those conditions, letting them in could be worth it.","Drama could be flaring in a community you belong to at this time, as disagreement about the group's fundamental values might cross the line into emotional manipulation. Under such circumstances, you may be understandably reluctant to say your piece, as there is a possibility you could be misunderstood. That said, taking this risk could let you find individuals you really connect with, no matter what happens to the group. Meanwhile, staying grounded in your routine responsibilities can help you keep any conflict in perspective.","A heavy focus on your need for security could make things awkward in your professional life today. Others likely aren't as attuned to the minor details of your communications as you might think they are, but they may notice if you seem stressed. Honestly expressing yourself could be better received than you'd expect, as people will often respond positively to things you do or say with confidence. You might even really enjoy yourself once you begin helping yourself and everyone else share a pleasant mood!","Researching a secret that fascinates you could be rewarding right now, and following your unique sense of intuition might lead you to an unexpected breakthrough. Nevertheless, you may still need to turn your thoughts inward and get clear with yourself about what is motivating your search. Though you might think you're justified in getting information from outside the usual channels, make sure that you're living in line with your values and treating others how you would want to be treated.","An outside perspective on a situation in your life where money is possibly being handled manipulatively could be helpful for you today. You may now be more equipped than usual to present your side of the story in a way that's favorable to you. Even so, seeking advice does risk that you might be told something you don't want to hear. If your own desire to maintain control is keeping you in a bad situation, you may need to address that.","Someone close may seem overly dramatic today. Instead of reflexively condemning them for that, you might want to reflect on the role you play in the emotional atmosphere of this relationship. You may think you're doing a good job of keeping your own difficult moods to yourself, but you could be showing your hand more than you intend to. If the other person doesn't know exactly why you're tense, they could think they did something to cause it -- your honesty might help.","Routine chores could become the focus of conflict today. The trouble may stem from unclear expectations, in which case a clear plan that spells out what each person is responsible for might help. On the other hand, maybe an existing plan of that sort is being used to bully someone whose legitimate extenuating circumstances aren't being taken into account. If you tell other friends about your heated dispute, though, they might laugh at its pettiness -- which could be exactly the perspective you need!","A community you belong to may not be very much fun right now, and you might take it upon yourself to help them lighten up. Your goal is likely to make the group a better place rather than to get attention for yourself, and your efforts will probably be taken that way. While you may not get rid of the serious problems that are on people's minds, showing them that there's still good in the world is a valuable gift all on its own."
2021-10-28,"We could be tempted to find out how far we can go today, and we might actually discover the answer! Fortunate Venus forms a friendly sextile with expansive Jupiter at 3:15 pm EDT, so we may have the inspiration and the confidence to go for our biggest ideas. Meanwhile, the Moon in dramatic Leo provokes the intense Scorpio Sun into a challenging square, so emotions can easily heat up. The Moon's opposition to stern Saturn, however, might finally demand that we acknowledge our limits.","Elaborate plans may be cooking in an organization you belong to at this time, and you could get caught up in the excitement. Before you agree to take on new responsibilities, be sure to take an honest look at whether or not they really fit into your schedule. Making sure that shared costs or obligations are truly shared and not just dumped on you could be important. Though asking questions may dampen the mood of the moment, it's likely necessary for a good outcome.","An authority figure could be willing to invest in you now, but your emotions about this might be more mixed than you would have expected beforehand. Though you may be flattered by their interest, you might also be intimidated by the idea of a closer relationship with them. There could be trouble if you sense that they're trying to push you in a direction that isn't right for you, but they may be very helpful to you if their goals truly are aligned with yours.","You might be able to get all of the intellectual stimulation you want in one of your close relationships today. As exciting as the chatter may be, you could learn something about the other person during a conversation that changes how you see them. Even if you don't like what they tell you, try to be respectful of the risk they took in opening up. Ultimately, you'll be better off knowing the truth rather than keeping an image in your head that reality doesn't support.","Working together for the common good may appeal to you now, but you might begin to feel like you're being asked to give more than your fair share. You may be reluctant to say anything because you don't want others to question your support for the overall goal. However, given that collaborators are acting like you're a key figure in getting things done, your discomfort could be important for them to know about. Speaking up would be the first step toward finding a better workflow.","Relationships of any kind may run hot and cold for you now, as you might not be sure what you want. If you pursue security and stability at any cost, you could wind up with a lack of passion. On the other hand, you might be afraid that prioritizing passion will set off something unpredictable or even uncontrollable. You may not be able to entirely resolve this dilemma today, but cultivating your relationship with yourself could help you uncover some insights.","You may be able to make a lot of progress on chores at home at the moment -- as long as you don't have to talk about it. Trying to explain your unique workflow to others could really frustrate you, as you might feel like they don't understand why you want things done a particular way. Focusing your energy on something that's entirely your domain, where no one else has the right to interfere with how you do it, may be the best option.","People in your community may seem like they expect a lot from you today. It could be necessary for you to take a look at what you've led them to expect in the past. While it can be easy to agree to things to make people happy in the moment, you might need to start considering the costs before you say yes. Setting boundaries around how you express yourself, even if it's hard, can help you find peace in the long run.","You may have to choose between pursuing the financial security that can come from throwing yourself into your work and the stability of doing what needs to be done at home. This might be more a question of your own priorities rather than one that's influenced by outside forces, which can make your decision even harder. When it comes down to it, your finances could cast a crucial vote! If you can afford to focus on your domestic life today, do it.","The people around you may be more interested than usual in socializing with you today, but you could feel like they don't meet your intellectual needs. You may be more capable of appreciating the things that they do have to offer if you make time to pursue your passions on your own. When you take responsibility for your own satisfaction, you can put less pressure on others to provide it for you. This then gives them room to pleasantly surprise you.","It may be hard to say how much money you really have right now. Depending on who you compare yourself to, you could feel either rich or poor. This ambiguity could be frustrating, but it could also be used to your advantage if someone else wants a cut of whatever you have. Like the way putting money in some types of retirement accounts can reduce your taxable income, there may be an approved way for you to maximize the resources you keep for yourself.","Close relationships may be frustrating for you now, yet you could be oddly popular with your broader social network. It might be that you're more relaxed when it comes to what you see as lower-pressure relationships, and then that sets the tone for them to respond to you in a similar way. Look for the direct impact of what you bring to the table to help you determine what you may need to adjust in the connections that are harder for you at the moment.","Your hard work behind the scenes today may win the appreciation of those in power. That said, you could still feel overworked -- if so, you might need to examine your beliefs about the situation. While others probably could be supporting you better, you may also have some unrealistic expectations about what should happen as a result of your labor. You might be hoping for emotional rewards beyond what any type of work can reasonably give you, and the resulting disappointment could sap your energy."
2021-10-29,"Dramatic surprises may be heading our way as the emotional Moon in theatrical Leo makes a provocative square to shocking Uranus at 6:25 am EDT. Later today, the Moon forms a friendly sextile with intellectual Mercury, so we might be able to think clearly about whatever comes up. However, we could have trouble balancing our individual ego needs with what seems to be best for the group as the Moon challenges selfless Neptune. Suppressing anything now could cause more trouble down the road!","Someone close to you may be using your trust in them as leverage to convince you to take a financial risk. You could be left in the lurch if things go wrong, though, so do your own research to look for hidden traps that even the person pushing the plan might not be aware of. You might discover some neat benefits of the opportunity, but you should only move forward when you can be truly confident that you're making the best decision for yourself.","Getting a lot of cleaning and decluttering done at home might not be as much of its own reward for you today as you'd like it to be. You may feel like your friends are all doing something more exciting. Keep in mind that your impression of how much fun others are having might not be entirely accurate, and try to stay grounded in your own experience. When you feel your own emotions beyond the fear of missing out, you may be pleasantly surprised!","Feeling like you need to tiptoe around a touchy subject could make expressing yourself difficult today. Though your focused effort might successfully prevent you from offending any of the particular sensitivities you were originally worried about, you may wind up shocking people anyway by spilling details about something different, perhaps without realizing its potential for drama. You might not be able to guarantee a perfectly bland conversation at the moment, but avoiding the worst pitfall can help you weather ones that are more survivable.","Peer pressure could be encouraging you to do something reckless financially, and you might have trouble finding information that's accurate enough to help you make a good decision about it. Your family might give you a more levelheaded perspective. Though their reminders of your responsibilities may seem a little boring, you might also appreciate the excuse to say no to something you don't feel quite right about. Let them help you be the voice of reason until everyone else moves on.","Feeling held back emotionally may tempt you to go a bit wild in public, as it could seem like the answer to boundaries that are too rigid for your comfort is to drop your boundaries altogether. A calmer conversation with someone you may take for granted in your daily life could help you let off some steam. You probably do need more room to express yourself, which you might feel more acutely than usual with the Moon in your sign today, but try to maintain balance.","Finding the truth in a close relationship may be hard for you now. The other person might be hiding some things from you, but you could also be hiding things from yourself. You may already know these things on some level and simply don't want to acknowledge them. If you aren't ready to confront the deepest levels of the problem yet, that's OK -- but you might have to at least accept the reality of any financial or material facts involved.","A chatty atmosphere in your social life may wander into some surprisingly deep territory today. Though you might not see this coming, it could be a welcome distraction from irritations involving your work or health that don't have easy answers. Plus, taking this break from your problems may be just what you need to see them more clearly! A friend or acquaintance might be able to help you without even realizing they're doing so by sharing an experience with some parallels to yours.","Sensitivity can count for a lot in your career at this time. You might be frustrated that asking directly for what you want seems so complicated, but your ability to notice and articulate hidden dynamics may help you build surprising relationships. Connecting with someone who's more visibly assertive could be good for you, but try to keep things above board with them. Instead of trying to subtly manipulate anyone into fighting your battles for you, ask them directly to coach you.","Your friends may want to have a logical conversation right now, but you could find your emotions wandering into it without permission. It might be better for you to honestly admit that instead of loudly insisting that you really are being entirely rational. Consider the possibility that something happening currently is triggering a wound from your childhood. You may need to acknowledge the past, but letting yourself actually feel the sensations of your body can help you stay grounded in the present.","Fuzzy communication about a matter of shared property or money may be exasperating for you at the moment, even though you might be contributing to the confusion yourself. Impulsively blurting out the first solution that comes to your mind could just make things worse. Instead, try talking to an authority figure about the problem. Having to explain the situation to someone who isn't already familiar with it could clear up some of your uncertainty -- and their wisdom could help you even further!","Bringing your intellectual appetite into your close relationships could be tempting for you at this time, but doing so might threaten the sense of security you get in those relationships. You may have to consider if a peace that depends on keeping some opinions vague is a peace worth keeping. While taking a risk now could potentially make your connection stronger in the future, you might not be able to have both calm and candor today. Decide what this moment needs more.","Some appreciation from others for the way you carry out your routine responsibilities might be quite welcome today. However, dropping hints may not get you what you want. A direct approach could be more useful, but it may have unintended consequences -- someone might offer to help with the work. You may need to decide whether it's more important for you to get personal recognition or for the tasks to get done. If these responsibilities are better off shared, you might need to accept that!"
2021-10-30,"Our frustrations may be grating, but we can find the energy to address them. Today might start out a little sluggish as the assertive Sun is blocked by a discouraging square with gloomy Saturn. Contrastingly, action-oriented Mars enters powerful Scorpio, one of his favorite signs, at 10:21 am EDT. We may then experience emotional satisfaction from getting stuff done, as the Moon in motivated Virgo sextiles Mars. Even if we don't finish everything, we can still be proud of what we've gotten done.","The idea of getting some advice on sorting out difficult issues, possibly involving shared money or property, could be quite enticing at the moment. The thoughts of others, however, might not be helpful in the end. Friends may not understand the complicated details of your situation, so they could add to your burdens by reacting in a way that you find discouraging. Having to rely on your own judgment, no matter how stressful it is, might be your best option.","Standing up for yourself in a relationship with someone who has power over you, like a parent or a mentor, could be hard for you now. You may feel like coming up with just the right argument to get them to back off is a lot of work. If nothing you do to make a case for yourself seems to work, maybe the problem isn't you! Just being able to tell yourself that they're the one out of line could help you.","You may be interested in getting organized at home, but the idea of having to stick to a rigid plan could discourage you. Remember that decluttering gurus are just individuals who found what worked for them! While some things are probably universally true, like that you need to clean up any obvious piles of dust, you might have more room than you think to blaze your own trail. Deal with the easy problems first, and then follow your heart when it's time for the details.","You may have an intense urge to express yourself today, one that might have been building for a while. If you're resentful about having held back in the past, do your best not to take it out unfairly on whoever you finally talk to now. Though there could be things you legitimately need to confront this specific person about, keep a realistic sense of what they're actually responsible for. Your accumulation of issues may also include other problems they didn't cause.","The stresses of living together may weigh on one of your relationships today. If it's obvious that spending a little extra money would fix something that's bothering you, doing so is probably worthwhile -- especially if you've been considering this for some time! You may now be better equipped than usual to make a thoughtful purchase or necessary upgrade. With your determined energy and passion channeled into hunting for the best bargain, you could find yourself calmer in your interactions with housemates.","The desire to connect with the people around you could conflict with your feelings of obligation to any responsibilities today. The more resentful you feel about your chores blocking you from fun, though, the more time it might take you to get them done. Try to have conversations with at least one of your friends before you start your work. This taste of the reward you're working toward may motivate you to power through the rest of your to-do list!","The drive to make more money may motivate you to utilize something other than your usual income source right now. Still, be sure that you're taking any new risks out of intelligent calculation rather than desperation! You might also be seeing your existing financial picture in a gloomier light than it deserves. That said, an opportunity you'd still find compelling even if you weren't motivated by immediate need could be worth pursuing. You can make a good choice if you have the right reasons.","Showing a more assertive side of your personality in your social life might bring you a new opportunity today! You may worry that pursuing the offer could lead you away from other things that you rely on for feelings of security, but holding yourself back from developing to your fullest potential can ultimately threaten your security in its own way. It would likely be better to push through your fear for now. In addition, you may have more energy than usual to do so successfully.","You may have discovered an interesting secret recently, but not being able to share it could be hard on you, especially today. You might have noticed a situation where others would obviously find it clarifying to know what you know. While it may still be important to respect someone else's need for confidentiality if it's more their secret than yours, you could work behind the scenes to convince them to open up. Learning what you've observed might change how everyone else involved sees things.","Tempers may run high today, as people in your social circle could get riled up over a contentious issue in the news. You might think that you help by adding some relevant facts and figures to the discussion, but you could wind up disappointed to discover that people aren't that interested -- even those whose arguments are supported by your facts. Some people like the excitement of fighting even more than they like being right, so you may be better off avoiding unproductive debates altogether.","With great power comes great responsibility -- but you could be feeling especially weighed down by the responsibility at this point. Though your ambition may be higher than ever, you might need to maintain a rational idea of what's really sustainable for you as you consider expanding your authority. Forming an alliance to share power may take some of the pressure off of you. As long as you pick others who are compatible with you, their help could be worth its costs.","Catching up on your reading list may not be particularly relaxing today, as you might come across something that reminds you of an upsetting problem in your own life. Fortunately, this could give you the words to talk to someone about what's bothering you. Even though your intense emotions may be making it hard for you to figure out how to present the topic, being able to refer to an outside perspective as needed should help you keep the conversation on track."
2021-10-31,"Some quiet determination may be necessary today, but we can take pride in the results when we get things done! Awkward Chiron and melancholy Saturn challenge the practical Virgo Moon to find a way out of a gloomy mood. As pace-setting Luna makes a sextile with the life-sustaining Sun at 4:58 am EDT, taking action can push us forward. We might not be loud about it, but in the end, the Moon's trine to innovative Uranus could help us find clever solutions to our challenges.","You may be glad to throw yourself into your chores or responsibilities today, as they might provide a distraction from any awkward social dynamics that are dragging you down. Carefully maintaining your possessions can have a transformative effect on your space and on how those items perform whenever you use them. These visible results from your work could help you feel better about yourself. You may not be able to control how others feel about you, but you can control this.","You might now be able to respond creatively to big problems that are weighing on you, like difficulties with authority figures or feelings of confinement. Even if you just make a cathartic post or meme for social media, your dead-on attention to the little details of the situation could make your portrayal something that really resonates with others. Humor is a great way to bond, so someone who gets a laugh out of your creation might be moved to strike up a connection with you.","A situation in your home or family life may need your intense focus at the moment. It might temporarily keep you away from your preferred intellectual pursuits, but solving these domestic challenges could require you to think in a new, intriguing way. You may also wind up using your physical skills more than you usually do. Though you might not get public recognition for this triumph, you can still take pride in your ability to figure out an innovative solution.","Conversations with your friends can invigorate you at this time. You might have a lot to say about some stressful or intense power dynamics, and your friends could be up to the challenge of helping you explore that further. Beyond that, simply having the experience of expressing yourself and being received well may build your confidence enough to help you deal with other situations where people aren't as kind to you. Knowing the problem may not be you can really count for a lot.","Negotiating the structure of your commitment to someone else may push you to get serious about money today. Though you might have a reasonably secure foundation, the details could need some refining. Luckily, when you start from a place where you feel grounded, you can identify the risks that are worth taking. Updating your arrangement to include something a little bit outside the box may work well for you now -- as long as you have the skills to know what you're doing.","You may be passionate about your beliefs and experiences at this time. With the Moon now in your sign, you might be more willing than usual to let your emotional side out. Make sure that you don't extend yourself too far into what's rightly someone else's business! While an unconventional choice or activity might be a good fit for you, insisting that you know what's best for others is likely to provoke pushback. You can share your story, but keep it about you.","Feeling blocked by and exasperated with others could currently nudge you to look within. If you start to count up what you personally have going for you, you might discover some possibilities for financial gain hiding in plain sight! You probably have most of the basic ingredients already -- they just need to be arranged more effectively. Especially when it comes to sharing resources in a relationship, you might need to focus on what works for the unique individuals involved rather than the common practice.","Frustration with your boring routine might push you to make an extra effort to connect with your friends today. A dose of fun with these people could turn out to be just the renewal you need, as they may help you reconnect with your own lighthearted side that might have gotten lost in a recent shuffle. Even though you probably still have some tedious parts of your life, bringing a more upbeat version of yourself to your work could make it much less dreary.","Maintaining your reputation may be on your mind at the moment, though you might be especially aware of how that limits your self-expression. Instead of focusing on what you can and can't say, try putting your effort into finding real ways to do things better. An obvious success in this regard might get you both recognition and the secure place you seek. As actions speak louder than words, reliably achieving tangible results may convince people to overlook an occasional verbal faux pas.","The truth regarding a financial matter might now turn out to be less scary than you feared. Focused research could help you unsnarl the details of this issue as it relates to your money. You may find it sensible to make an informed decision about pursuing a slightly risky investment, but be sure you know exactly what you're getting into. Someone in your social network might be able to reassure you by confirming your knowledge, and they could also benefit from hearing your perspective.","Opening up to someone else and displaying emotional intimacy could inspire you to get out of a bad mood today. Something about the situation might surprise you! It could involve a person you wouldn't expect, or the way they handle things might not be what you're used to. This encounter may help you reform your idea of what security looks like. While you might imagine that being secure means being stifled, it can actually include connecting in a way that still honors your independence.","Inhibitions, especially about money, might be getting you down at this time. Taking the risk of talking to someone about it could really help you change your outlook. While you may feel overwhelmed and not know where to start, a trusted peer might be able to see things more clearly and guide you to the most important parts. You may find that the different pieces of information that come to you are less intimidating once you learn how they fit into the big picture."
2021-11-01,"Adventure awaits all of us today thanks to curious Mercury making a stimulating trine to expansive Jupiter at 12:18 am EST. We should seize this chance to study, travel, and write, because exploring the unknown could have great results. Unfortunately, temptation also lurks in the world as the temperamental Moon forms tough angles to illusory Neptune and extravagant Venus, warning us that all that glitters is not gold. Still, we can find balance if we hold out until Luna moves into balanced Libra later this evening.","Many benefits can be found in an expert's experience today, provided you set aside your ego. Don't be too proud to ask questions and take notes when working as part of a team or studying something new -- your efforts could produce something that gets lots of praise, even if you've never done it before! While almost no one can be good at something right away, people may take your ideas more seriously when your initial efforts make it clear how hard you've worked.","You may want to explore the limits of your professional potential right now, as the idea of a project that's beyond the scope of your regular duties could seem like it will pay off handsomely. Don't hesitate to try your hand at an unfamiliar task or take on a new client. If you're looking for work, you might want to apply for jobs in industries other than those you've previously occupied. You could be a great fit for an intriguing emerging field.","There's never been a better time to gain mastery over a subject that's always fascinated you. No matter what topic you want to dive into, you could learn a lot right now and have fun in the process. Honing your skills could even lead to an exciting travel opportunity! If you're stuck at home, you can still learn and grow right where you are by setting small, attainable goals -- like cleaning out a single drawer instead of ridding the entire place of clutter.","Expressing your feelings can pave the way to richer, more satisfying relationships with your loved ones. In the past, you may have been taken to task for being too emotional. Today, though, you might discover that someone really appreciates your depth of feeling and care. Prepare for some tender emotions, but let things happen naturally. Resist the temptation to pressure anyone to admit things that they may be sensitive about. Let them tell you how they feel when they're ready.","People around you could find your creative ideas and rich imagination utterly charming at the moment, and it might feel quite satisfying to have such a receptive audience for your antics. The warmth, humor, and curiosity that you have are all strong lures to like-minded friends and potential friends. As generous as you tend to be, you may not be able to shower loved ones with lavish gifts right now, but that's OK! Heartfelt expressions of appreciation probably matter far more to you and the people you care about.","Finding new ways to make money may be a good option today. Look for flexible positions or paid projects. You might even be able to find one where you can work remotely, allowing you to improve your finances from anywhere in the world. A fresh opportunity could also resolve some deep-seated grievances you may have from previous gigs where you could have been woefully underpaid. No one is perfect -- not even you -- but you can still ask for what you're really worth!","Your fantastic ideas may finally get the appreciation they deserve. Today, take any opportunity to make a sales pitch or reach out to someone you haven't spoken to in a while. You could be pleasantly surprised by the applause you receive for even a whimsical notion. Self-doubt can rear its ugly head when you repress your impulses -- don't let any anxieties or fears keep you down. Take a leap of faith and get out there to seize the day!","Believing in yourself could help you move mountains today. You may be particularly interested in efforts that involve beautifying your surroundings or strengthening a community of yours. While some of your friends may not understand your impulse to forgo practical considerations in favor of more heart-centered matters, they might have to eat their words when they see all the good you can do! This is not the time to question your impulses -- instead, let the results speak for themselves.","A reunion with a kindred spirit could refresh your mind and heart right now. It can feel so good to touch base with somebody who knows a part of you that you may have been keeping hidden. Connecting with someone like this might help you both rediscover a shared interest, perhaps relating to a creative or intellectual pursuit the two of you enjoyed together. This could be particularly enriching if you've been surrounded by people who have been questioning your creativity lately.","Finding a way to make money by doing something you love is a great priority at the moment. Instead of letting onlookers question your abilities, seek out those who will support you in the way you deserve. Don't be afraid to approach opportunities that seem out of your league -- there's no telling what you can do today! Others who are interested in what you do could feel threatened by your skill, but their jealousy shouldn't hold you back at all.","Connecting with others who admire and appreciate your instincts can be particularly gratifying today, so any chance to put your knowledge on display should be welcomed with open arms. Even if you don't relish the prospect of making a presentation or speaking in front of others, you will likely enjoy this opportunity in the end. It might even be the beginning of an ongoing gig or new social group that could bring you tremendous creative and spiritual satisfaction. Let your voice be heard!","A close conversation today could send shivers down your spine. You might discover that a peer you admire feels the same appreciation for you, and together, you can explore dark realms and dive into deep waters that others are too afraid to venture into. Past companions may not have appreciated your unique abilities, but this friend could be wonderfully different. Embrace the chance to try something with them that's brand new and outside of your usual style."
2021-11-02,"Changes may occur at light speed today as picky Mercury forms a tense square to intense Pluto at 5:39 am EDT. Instead of fussing over the details, we should focus on the big picture. The sooner we can concentrate on everything working out overall, the smoother we can make any transitions happen. Let the universe take care of any pesky paperwork or permissions necessary for a breakthrough to occur. Finally, a sweet trine between the balanced Moon and dedicated Saturn brings more emotional stability.","An imposing official may not want to reach a compromise. For now, it might be best to do things their way -- even if you disagree with their approach. Sometimes, you need to know when to walk away. Fortunately, a loved one will likely be there to reassure you that all is well. Thanks to their support, you can maintain your dignity and find the opportunities for growth available in this stressful situation. Remember that it's OK to ask for emotional support when you need it.","This isn't a good day to argue with an expert, even if they have frustrating or heavy-handed methods that you don't like. While you would likely prefer to catch flies with honey instead of vinegar, this situation may require directly talking to them to get past any unpleasantness. On the other hand, you could distract yourself by working on a professional project that requires your focus, really paying attention to its details. Finishing this endeavor could net you some well-deserved praise.","The resources you need might not be available at the moment. Rather than dwelling on this lack, try to find a workaround with the tools you already have. People might be quite impressed with the results, and your resourceful behavior could be appreciated by a creative person who's dealt with similar challenges. Don't brush off any compliments from them -- this could be the start of a deep friendship. The two of you may even decide to team up for an inspiring artistic collaboration.","You might feel tired of being taken for granted by someone you're close with. Giving way to their demands could be making a bad situation worse, and it may be time to summon your emotions for a heart-to-heart talk. By stating what you need from this partnership, you can make it stronger or pave the way for a more rewarding alliance. Either way, there are benefits to be found. Later, a heartfelt encounter could wipe away any tears and remind you of your tremendous worth.","This may be a good day to look for fresh career opportunities in your profession. It's possible that some ridiculous demands and fruitless discussions about them have been really weighing on you in your current position. Working smarter, not harder, will give you more time for the leisure you love! Fortunately, someone likely needs a new employee with your precise skill set. By describing your dream job to friends and family, you could attract something that feels more like play than work.","Any potential discussions about compensation could be tricky. Right now isn't the best time to ask for a raise or enter salary negotiations. While it is good to be paid what you're worth, consider waiting a few days to bring up the issue. The powers that be will probably be more receptive to your demands in the future. In the meantime, seek out a colleague or friend who appreciates all you do. Just being in their company can keep your self-esteem high!","Although your gift with words is probably very strong, it may not be enough to sweet talk a stubborn relative. Ultimately, this family member might do what they feel is best -- even if it's inconvenient for everyone else. Don't get sucked into an argument that drains your energy! Remember things that truly bring you joy, like creative projects or other relationships in your life. Balancing yourself like that can inspire you to wish your loved one well and let them follow their own star.","If anything gets under your skin, Scorpio, it's being given an order! Unfortunately, that's just what a close relative or neighbor might do. Don't unleash your wrath just yet -- first, consider how you can benefit from playing along. By meeting any extraordinary demands, no one can accuse you of being uncooperative. That can help you gain the freedom to set your own schedule. Being able to organize the ways you spend your time any way you want would be a handsome reward.","Someone could be trying to hold their superior financial position over your head -- they may have mistaken your optimistic outlook for a naïve one. Happily, you can likely spot tricksters and manipulators from miles away. Don't let them control you! Instead, try to devise a fun or humorous way to beat them at their own game. You could even make an alliance with a seasoned professional who appreciates your work. You can find better options for making money than any charlatan could offer.","There's nothing wrong with listening to other opinions, even when they vary greatly from your own. Take today to consider if a clever person in an organization you belong to has a concept that's worth trying. Even if their approach departs wildly from the traditional method, it could be remarkably effective. If this idea fails, you can always revert to Plan A. If it works, then you've gained a valuable new method of getting stuff done in this area. Take the chance to find out!","Holding on to a grudge won't serve you well, particularly right now. It may be difficult for you to release slights and unfair situations, but consider how you might be being unfair to yourself by remaining angry. Luckily, someone you admire could understand and sympathize with your situation. Try reaching out to them for a pep talk! Hearing their take on your situation may make it easier to move on to greener pastures. A new role as an innovative leader might be right around the corner!","You might be ready to make a change, but people in your social circle could want you to stay put. Trying to make everyone happy will be an exercise in futility, so make stepping into your own power a priority today. Whether this means embarking on a personal passion project or investing your resources in a new business doesn't matter -- the important thing is to follow your heart! Let your soul guide you to your true north so you can reap the amazing benefits."
2021-11-03,"Good times are in the air today as the sentimental Libra Moon flirts with jolly Jupiter, thoughtful Mercury, and glamorous Venus. Spending time with our favorite people can make the world seem much sweeter -- we may even seek out new connections. This is a great day to find someone with similar tastes in fun. Although Luna's harsh square to deep Pluto warns against rushing into a commitment, the Moon's move into probing Scorpio at 8:52 pm EDT paves the way for in-depth questions as we get to know new companions.","It may be tempting to treat partnerships like power struggles -- instead, think of them as alliances. A close colleague could be on your side today, and finding a way to combine your talents might produce some exceptional work. One of you can take bold risks while the other can polish any rough diamonds you discover. Together, you could be unstoppable. Unfortunately, someone in a position of power may feel threatened by your exceptional work, but do your best to take any petty criticisms with a grain of salt.","A burning desire to find a kindred spirit may have let you down in the past. That probably won’t be the case now, however, as you could meet someone who ticks all your boxes. Trying to humor this new friend with your earthy sense of humor will be a welcome challenge. If you’re uncertain whether you want to give this person full admittance into your inner circle, stick to light topics and focus on having a good time for now.","You can attract admirers wherever you go right now! Instead of brushing off any compliments, drink them in. This praise could give you the confidence you need to launch a daring creative project and inspire all sorts of clever ideas for putting a fresh spin on an outmoded style. Intellectual projects will likely come more easily than material ones, but no matter what you want to create, staying focused will help you dream up something truly lovely today.","Family can be a tremendous source of pleasure right now, as a close relative may offer emotional support for a bold endeavor. You might be reaching out to connect with someone new, going on an extended vacation, or starting a home-based business, and it'll be great to have familial encouragement for every exciting possibility. Success is practically guaranteed when you follow your heart. Unfortunately, a resentful person from your past may try to take the wind out of your sails -- don't let their jealousy bring you down!","Your star power could be intimidating, Leo! Playing a supportive role for today may be greatly appreciated by a shy friend. Using your charm to draw attention to their intelligence, grace, and excellent taste could even help them land a job or make new friends. Your naturally generous spirit can be in full evidence today. Even so, if this person seems to be more successful than you, don't fall prey to envy. Your time in the spotlight will come soon enough.","A chance to increase your income could fall right into your lap, and you may enjoy the chance to work alongside an expert who benefits from your specialized skills. While you might find their methods strange, remember that they're the authority figure and refrain from criticism until you can see the method to their madness. Only then can you offer genuinely constructive and helpful criticism. You might be a lot more proficient at this than you realize -- don't sell yourself short!","All eyes are on you right now! Someone may try to win your friendship with a variety of outrageous gestures, and the less you react, the more intense they could become. You can have a very fun time with this vigorous game of cat and mouse. If you'd prefer not to engage with them, though, keep hanging out with friends you already have. While a disdainful relative might be jealous of any social attention you receive, it's not your fault you're so charming.","Getting involved in a charitable endeavor could be a great use of your time today, as helping others can put your own problems in perspective. You may discover a wonderful talent for spinning straw into gold that would be greatly appreciated by a volunteer organization with limited resources. Unfortunately, a harsh critic could try to take the wind out of your sails. Instead of being discouraged by their words, let them inspire you to work even harder and show them just how much they underestimated you!","Beautiful friendships could be sparked today thanks to your friendly attitude and some witty banter with a newcomer in your workplace or neighborhood. You might be charmed by this person's skill with words, while they admire your easygoing nature. There may be a big discrepancy between your incomes, but that doesn't have to affect your bond -- the two of you can actually enjoy comparing your lifestyles and attitudes toward money. Let your social circle widen and include people from all walks of life!","A heavy-handed attitude toward work will most likely backfire today. Rather than insisting on following strict rules, allow yourself and your colleagues to take a more whimsical approach. You could all be delighted with the results -- one of them may even invite you to a small, fun gathering in return. You never know how charming people will find you until you let down your defenses. There's nothing wrong with mixing business with pleasure sometimes. Loosening up could even improve your professional prospects, so don't be afraid to have fun!","An opportunity to learn something new might fill you with excitement right now. It could be especially nice to work with a patient expert, perhaps one who encourages your experimental approach. In the past, you may have been discouraged from developing your own style, but you can find more freedom now. Instead of worrying about looking like a novice, practice your personal method until you feel comfortable with it. You might even be able to use your new skills to apply for a job or begin an intriguing project!","Retreating to a quiet corner could fill you with pleasure today. This is a wonderful way to get some rest, catch up on your reading, or meditate, as focusing on outside circumstances for too long can drain your energy. If you find yourself longing for money, status, or attention, turn your concentration inward. Remember the good things that are already in your life and let them calm your spirit -- centering yourself like this can help you make real plans to achieve your goals."
2021-11-04,"Profound changes regarding our relationships could shift into place today thanks to the New Moon in transformative Scorpio at 5:15 pm EDT. Instead of trying to make our own luck, we're being invited to receive the universe's endless bounty. If we experience loss, it's important to stay calm -- anything that falls away probably no longer served us, as indicated by Luna's harsh aspects to mature Saturn and awakening Uranus. When the controlling Sun opposes Uranus this evening, we're encouraged to exchange safety for spontaneity.","The sooner you release resentment toward people or events, the happier you will be. Dwelling on a toxic relationship or panicking if a source of income dries up at this time could block the resources you desire. By keeping your eyes firmly trained on the horizon, you can make your way toward a more pleasant destination. Stay positive and know that this period of stress won't last forever. No matter how dark it is right now, there's a brighter future in store for you.","Someone who is quirky and unpredictable may catch your eye today. Whether it's a friend, a love interest, or a workmate, letting this rebel inject some spontaneity into your life could be surprisingly beneficial. Instead of searching for your ideal companion, set your expectations aside and be open to spending time with people who are radically different from those you've known before. Venturing out of your comfort zone might not be so scary with this person at your side. They may even give you the courage to change your look in a positive way.","Constant self-criticism could be keeping you down at the moment. If you want to meet some personal goals, you might need to build up your confidence. You may worry that you won't be able to reach the finish line at all, but don't give up! A multi-talented person like you can do almost anything you set your mind to. You could discover entirely new facets of yourself as you work toward these goals -- and perhaps uncover previously hidden parts of someone else as well.","People likely think more highly of you than you realize. Don't feel compelled to prove your worth to someone you want to impress. Instead, take this moment to dedicate yourself to the activities and people that give you joy. Your light can truly shine bright when you have fun and let yourself laugh as loud as you want. Hanging out with your real friends will be far more enjoyable than chasing someone who doesn't see how amazing you already are.","Worrying about the future isn't likely to make today any better. Rather than trying to steer your ship where you want it to go, let it drift! You might be surprised by the wonderful surprises that flow your way. Even an energetic adventurer like you, Leo, could really benefit from a slower pace. It may take you far off the beaten path, to new places with all sorts of cultural diversions. The treasures of new experiences will likely be worth any stress the voyage causes.","Negative judgments might be undermining your social life at this time. The world is filled with an infinite variety of people, and by accepting others for who they are, you can also become more forgiving toward yourself. Shortcomings that used to keep you awake may begin to seem like charming quirks, and you might even work up the courage to try your hand at something totally new. Your updated outlook could surprise friends and family, but once they adjust to any changes, they'll likely support you completely.","Financial fears could make a difficult situation worse. To cultivate the abundance you seek, imagine yourself living your desired lifestyle with your ideal daily routine. When you think about it, you might realize that you already have just about everything you need to thrive. Get into the habit of making a gratitude list -- even just inside your head -- every time you feel a sense of lack. Anything that brings you joy can go on your list, no matter how simple it may seem.","You may be feeling a sense of rejection from a recent experience, but this doesn't have to be a crisis. There are plenty of people who would make great friends, collaborators, or partners, and it's likely the person who turned you down wouldn't have made a good teammate for you anyway. Don't be afraid to set out for greener pastures! Still, it's normal to be upset in a situation like this, so think about slowing down this evening and spoiling yourself with an indulgent experience to heal your heart. You're worth it.","Suppressing your emotions could be difficult today, although you may not be in a place where you're free to let them out. You might want to look into alternatives to potential confrontations, such as sharing your feelings with a counselor or writing in a journal. When channeled in a healthy direction, anger and pain can still trigger positive change. Plus, getting it out of your system in a beneficial way could help you focus on other work with less stress clouding your mind.","You could feel like a fish out of water at the moment. Venturing into unfamiliar territory is almost never easy for a cautious Capricorn like you, but it might be especially challenging right now. Take a deep breath and keep your mind centered as best you can. Your calm demeanor could help everyone else involved relax as well, and your peers may admire your reserve and respect your prowess even more than before. Even in strange situations, you can come out on top!","It's not necessary to remain stuck in a no-win situation. This may be the time to quit a job or leave a project that makes you miserable, even if you don't have another thing to do lined up after it. Your unorthodox talents and innovative skills could attract a moneymaking opportunity surprisingly quickly -- perhaps even one that allows you to work from home. No matter what happens, simply escaping a toxic environment will probably be a huge relief.","Some mysteries will never be solved. Instead of wasting time trying to decipher someone's strange behavior, take today to work on a skill of your own. It may be difficult for you to stick with a tough endeavor, but you're capable of pushing past any uncertainty all the way to the finish line. Learning how to do something both fun and useful could give you a much-needed confidence boost. Don't let confusing or negative feedback get you down -- just keep practicing!"
2021-11-05,"Emotional and financial security are within reach once fulfilled Venus moves into reliable Capricorn at 6:44 am EDT. The best way to achieve stability is to cultivate internal contentment, as the Scorpio Moon's positive angles to introspective Neptune and profound Pluto suggest. A hard angle between the Moon and excessive Jupiter can create unnecessary fears about money, but this anxiety is unwarranted, especially once persuasive Mercury moves into resourceful Scorpio, helping us discover passive income streams. The Moon's later entry into upbeat Sagittarius helps us end the day on a positive note.","Projecting an image of sophistication can pay off handsomely in your professional or public life. Check your impulses before you act and listen more than you speak. An air of calm helps to inspire confidence and might even pave the way for a lucrative and long-lasting deal. If you're looking for a collaborator, an accomplished person may cross your path now, but you might find them a bit mysterious. Talking about subjects that are off the beaten path can help you gain more insight into who they really are before you become official partners.","You might be eager to strike out in a new direction and leave outmoded habits behind, which is a big shift for a comfort-loving person like you, Taurus. Moving to somewhere brand-new, taking an advanced class, or going on a spiritual journey are among the exciting possibilities. If you have any last-minute reservations, ask someone you're very close with for a pep talk. Their encouraging words could inspire you to take that first step toward newfound happiness.","Geminis tend to live in the world of logic, but your emotional side is coming out today as loving Venus moves into your 8th House of Deep Connections. You may find that people are trying to relate to you in closer ways than before. As strange as it may seem at first, you'd be wise to open up a bit and share parts of yourself you're not used to sharing. Although a meeting of the minds feels fulfilling, you could be surprised at how much you get out of a more heartfelt experience.","Teamwork could be a great benefit to you right now, taking a great weight off your shoulders. By joining with someone who isn't afraid of hard work, you will be able to focus on the more creative tasks you enjoy. Not only can you get a lot more done when you work together, but you can be more satisfied as an individual as well. You might also find that a loved one is offered a well-deserved raise, promotion, or lucrative job, so make a point to celebrate their success!","You could strike gold on the work front starting today as happy Venus moves into your 6th House of Work and Routine. Clients and coworkers may become easier to relate to and show more appreciation for all that you do. Venus is also the planet of money, so stop selling yourself short -- if the services you provide are top-notch, don't be afraid to charge what you're worth. A boost in income can bring more comfort to your personal life, helping you finally carry out a home project you've been putting off.","As diligent as you are, even a focused Virgo needs to let loose every once in a while! Try to get all your tasks done early today and devote your time to fun, pleasurable activities. Whether it's a personal hobby, a lighthearted conversation with a friend, or an exciting outing somewhere nearby, you can truly rejuvenate yourself right now by focusing on what makes your heart happy. When the day is done, some quiet time at home might be just what you need to bring full balance to your life.",Home is where your heart should be right now because dedicating time to domestic pursuits can help bring you some stability -- especially if you've felt a bit scattered recently. This is a great time to host a family gathering or launch a redecorating project. Creating a quiet space where you can rest and reflect can be a great benefit to your mental health and comfort. You may even find that some extra money becomes available at just the right time to help you with this endeavor.,"Even if you might normally keep to yourself, socializing could really bring out the best in you right now, especially if you're mixing with people who are as passionate as you are. Taking a class just for fun could help you meet those with similar interests and also help to open your mind and change some perspectives. You might even find that things that used to bother you become more amusing, helping to lighten your heart. A little adventure could do you good.","You could find yourself truly blessed in the financial department today -- any hard work you've devoted your time and energy toward can finally start pulling in rewards. If you end up with mad money, you may want to splurge, but you'd also be wise to put some into savings as a safeguard against future economic uncertainty. You might also want to keep any windfalls a secret to keep opportunists from knocking at your door. If you choose to donate, an anonymous donation is probably the smartest move.","Your self-image gets a lovely boost today as attractive Venus enters your sign. Investing in your appearance in some way can not only make you feel good, but also draw new eyes in your direction. Friends may have a lot to say about your new, polished look, and it will likely all be supportive. With this kind of confidence and encouragement, you might set your sights on the future and be ready to take a step toward achieving your greatest dreams.","Although Aquarians tend to thrive when connecting with others, starting today, you might begin to find more beauty and benefit in times of solitude. Connecting with your spiritual center and practicing self-love can help you enter a new phase of contentment, one where you feel at peace with the world. You might feel like you should be more productive right now, but there will be a time and place for that. Later in the day, sharing some of your insights with a close friend could help to satisfy your craving for connection.","Spending time with friends can bring you a lot of relief. You might have been in great demand at work lately, prompting you to be on your best behavior and project an air of professionalism wherever you go. Now that this phase is ending, you get to let down your hair and kick up your heels.

2021-11-06,"Championing the underdog is a great way to challenge oppressive systems today, as the expressive Moon in Sagittarius makes a supportive sextile to determined Saturn in philanthropic Aquarius. We can find the courage to stick up for people and causes that may be overlooked or scorned otherwise.

Don't be shy about asking a friend or loved one to spend some time there with you, it could be very fulfilling.","A companion could be drawn to you right now through your sense of humor and your knowledge in your area of expertise. Even if you've known this person for years, today it might be particularly easy and fun to win their admiration through astute observations and sly jokes. An easygoing attitude may also make you popular in the workplace or in another public area of your life. Instead of intimidating people with your superior knowledge, you can inspire them to ask questions and learn more about new topics.","Your colleagues or other people you interact with regularly could offer you some very valuable guidance today. While doing favors for others may come easy to you, you also shouldn't hesitate to ask for help in return when you need it. If you're looking for work, they could give you some great tips that you might never have thought of on your own. Even if their suggestions seem a little different than what you usually do, you'd be wise to consider them. Their fresh ideas may make all the difference.","An answer might finally arrive today about whether or not a new acquaintance is interested in deepening your connection. It's exciting to discover that someone finds you interesting, but it may be wisest to resist your urge to chase after them right now. If you play it cool, they'll likely come to you. Give yourself permission to venture out of your social comfort zone and connect in a different way, with both new friends and current ones. Experiments could have a big payoff!","Although the prospect of eating nutritious meals and getting some physical activity may not thrill you to the core, you'll probably be really happy with the results of a more sensible regimen. Creating a healthy routine can really boost your energy and make you feel more present in your life. Don't expect an overnight transformation, just set small, manageable milestones and give yourself a reward every time you reach one. Slowly but surely, these measures could become like second nature to you.","An old friend may be able to promote a job or project of yours today, even if you haven't spoken to them in some time. It's nice to know that the connection is still there! Their publicity efforts could get you a much larger audience than you would have thought, no matter what kind of work you do. Seeing people appreciating your talents might give you a much-needed emotional boost. There's nothing wrong with basking in genuine admiration, especially for a humble soul like you, Virgo.","The universe is smiling on you today, Libra! Peers might be jealous of you -- if you weren't so charming. Your opportunities can really flourish as you make great use of your marketable skills, and you might even be able to achieve some sort of monetary bonus. How you choose to use this money is entirely up to you. It's important to budget your funds, but it's equally important to live happily and indulge in luxuries when you can. Take today to live the high life!","Life could feel a little bland right now, like you're stuck in a rut. A little change of scenery can help to lift your spirits and make you glow from the inside out. In particular, you may want to go somewhere with real history. Looking at beautiful antiques and unspoiled landscapes could really connect you to the past and put any of your negative feelings in perspective. Once you return home, you'll likely be more motivated to treat yourself better.","A social butterfly like you may hate isolation, but you could really benefit right now from working at home or another place that brings you joy. Instead of sitting in an uninspiring place and spending precious personal time on long commutes, you could have more energy and time to relax, connect with loved ones, or enjoy a hobby. You have a knack for creating an uplifting experience no matter where you are, but if you're really feeling lonely, you can also try getting involved with a group activity that piques your interest.","You can attract supporters and admirers like a flower draws bees today! Whether you want to begin a new personal project, find a more inspiring job, or meet someone who seems out of reach, you might be able to do so with the aid of your friends. It's even possible you could get a loan or financing thanks to a glowing reference. While you may feel reluctant to reach out, believing that you should do all the legwork yourself, people want to help you, so don't be afraid to ask.","You could really shine in your public or professional life today, no matter what you're working on. Being utterly different from your competitors can be a great strength at the moment, so it's a good thing your sign isn't afraid to stand out. The sooner you unconditionally accept yourself, the faster doors could swing open. People might find working with you refreshing when you're willing to challenge assumptions and experiment with different approaches. Your unique strengths can encourage people from all walks of life to support your bold ideas!","Being sensitive toward others can ease up your path to success today. Instead of feeling alienated, people could be more eager to help you advance. Although you're unlikely to befriend someone simply because of their status, you can benefit from knowing the right people right now. For instance, a kind word from a prominent friend or former professional connection might help you land a desirable job. Even if it's not a high-profile position, that might be a good thing -- working behind the scenes could be more satisfying for you."
2021-11-07,"Anxieties might pile high today, but we can still remember our blessings -- even while the fretful Moon squares deceptive Neptune, making it easy to imagine the worst-case scenario. By focusing on what's going right, perceived problems may dissolve by the time Luna forms a supportive angle to expansive Jupiter. Once the Moon enters earthy Capricorn at 8:03 pm EST, our emotions could finally stabilize. When it comes down to it, choosing a good mood can often be as easy as falling into a bad one.","When the world seems unfair, it's important to look for the helpers. In any given situation, there's usually a good soul who offers comfort and wisdom, and today, you could be that person! It may be especially rewarding to support someone who obviously is overwhelmed, and your warmth and generosity will likely be greatly appreciated. Putting out this positive energy could even attract an exciting opportunity your way, so make a point to acknowledge and show off your many unique strengths.","It may be tempting to get revenge on someone who's harmed you or someone you love. Instead of giving in to this desire, though, let your strong emotions motivate you to do something good right now. Sharing your resources with a loved one who is struggling could allow you to see things in a whole new light. Try to use any setbacks as launchpads to a happier, healthier life for you and the people you care about. Personal success will probably be far more vindicating than anything else!","You might be stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to an important choice today. If you're unhappy with the options you're being offered, take a few steps back and survey the situation. The best choice may be to leave whatever environment is forcing this on you and take off for greener pastures. Even if you can't physically leave, do what you can to improve the situation in your own mind, and don't turn down any help that arrives!","You may feel self-conscious in an unfamiliar setting right now. Rather than fretting over what you assume people think of you, try to take some deep breaths and listen to what's actually being said -- and what isn't. Focusing on people's body language could help you learn something valuable, and might even cause you to reflect on your own communication style. Recognizing the way people react to you now could change how you think about all your relationships for the better.","Contrary to what you might think, there is such a thing as negative attention, Leo! Resist your typical temptation to take center stage because doing so could get you in trouble today. If you want to make the best impression possible on a new public or professional connection, make an effort to show them that you can take the occasional back seat and be in a supportive role. Instead of competing for the spotlight, let generosity be your guiding light.","Your family could be causing tension for you at this time, but worrying about erratic relatives or the expectations of family members won't do you any favors. Try to base your behavior on what works best for you rather than what you're told you should do. If that means getting some distance from those who disapprove or don't understand, that might have to happen. Deciding to do this may be stressful, but the sense of release that a little freedom can bring will likely be worth it!","You might need to have a stressful conversation today about a mistake you made recently, even if you'd rather not mention it. Hiding the truth about whatever happened would be cause for regret in the long run, and you may actually be surprised by how trivial the situation turns out to be. If this talk doesn't go your way, follow it up with quality time with a loved one or quietly cozied up at home to ease any troubled feelings and recuperate from the shakeup.","A clumsy encounter today could leave you feeling embarrassed, but it's probably less of an issue than you fear. Believe it or not, people often find occasional awkwardness charming and relatable. Literally nobody is perfect, so remember this whenever you feel put on the spot. If someone asks you a question and you don't know the answer, instead of trying to stumble through it, just be honest and approach it with a sense of humor. This can open the door to lively conversations and more genuine connections.","You could be so intent on getting your own way today that you lose sight of other people's needs. It might be a good idea to check your calendar to make sure you haven't forgotten something important, like a gathering or a birthday. Even if you can't make time for it after all, a quick phone call or text is better than ignoring others altogether. Commit to catching up soon with a longer conversation or even meeting up somewhere in town to nurture these important connections.","Being on the same wavelength as others might be difficult today. Forcing a connection with a certain person could just be a waste of your time and energy if it's a relationship that's not bringing much to your life. Instead, concentrate on unions that can actually yield fruit. By reaching out to a friend or colleague from the past, you might learn of an opportunity that you wouldn't have known about otherwise, and it could be a great benefit to your future.","A glorious opportunity to forge your own identity is on the horizon! This might be particularly welcome if you've been feeling like a square peg in a round hole lately. While it's never easy to venture into unfamiliar territory, doing so is better than remaining stuck in an uncomfortable situation. This is a great day to introduce yourself to a new group -- and perhaps even join them in an activity. It doesn't have to be anything major, and afterward, you can retreat to a quiet place to recharge.","Expressing your true feelings might not be an option now. This could make you feel like a hypocrite, but it's OK to adjust to what the people around you need, even if it's a little frustrating sometimes. Do your best to soothe yourself with the knowledge you're doing the best you can. One thing you can control is your mood. Consider directing your attention inward to reconnect with your own power or using meditation and prayer to bring peace your way."
2021-11-08,"We're supported in making wise decisions when it comes to our public or professional lives as the Moon in successful Capricorn makes positive angles to patient Venus, sensible Mercury, and courageous Mars. It's a good time to schedule meetings about career advancement or even start negotiating a pay raise. The Moon makes a final helpful angle at 4:48 pm EST, this time to innovative Uranus, allowing us to find brilliant solutions to systemic problems. An open, honest conversation about policies and procedures could result in a more efficient way to go about things.","Although you have a reputation for being a wild card, Aries, projecting an air of calm sophistication today could win you the confidence of others. This is your chance to demonstrate your ability to stay the course, which could be especially comforting to a business or romantic partner who's been nervous about your future together. Sit down to make a long-term plan and be open to suggestions, especially about creative endeavors. Play to each other's strengths and let them attend to the details while you focus on the big picture.","As a creature of habit, you may feel reluctant to try new things, but venturing out of your comfort zone can be very stimulating now, especially if things have begun to feel dull. Acquiring a specialized skill helps bring back your zest for life, especially if it's something creative, like trying your hand at art or music or learning how to make a difficult recipe. The key is to branch out while you are inspired and do something brand-new.","You could see a boost in your finances by partnering with someone else and combining your skills right now. With your knowledge and talents working together, you could both gain a lot more than doing things on your own. A windfall from an inheritance, refund, or investment is also possible, and if you're overdue for a splurge, you might use it to indulge a little. When you treat yourself well, your sense of worth becomes stronger, and going after your desires starts to feel more natural.","Life may feel a bit lackluster as of late, so try to spend some time with one of your favorite people today. Problems that have been keeping you awake at night could seem relatively unimportant once you receive a jolt of joy. That’s the value of close relationships -- they keep life in perspective. Once you begin to see things a little more lightly and be a little more open, new opportunities tend to fall into your lap. Don’t question your good fortune, just embrace it!","An enjoyable daily routine tends to make you feel stable and centered. If things have felt a bit off recently, make more time in your schedule for physical activity, healthy meals, and quiet reflection. Putting your happiness first makes you a magnet for people and opportunities that are worthy of a superstar like you. As you’ve seen, friends who treat life like a struggle seem to always have difficulty, while those who adopt a laid-back approach seem to find luck at every turn. Put yourself in a positive position to receive.","Your dedication to your work and loyalty to others is quite admirable, but when was the last time you focused on your own pleasure? This is a great time to start planning a much-needed getaway. For you, Virgo, setting the agenda can be just as fun as the actual journey! Enjoy the process of searching for places to stay, eat, and experience something new. You could receive great suggestions from friends who've gone where you hope to go. It's always good to give yourself something to look forward to.","You might be in the mood to pull back today and savor the pleasures of home. Turning off your phone and devoting time to your favorite domestic activities can help to open your mind and satisfy your soul. With your brain and body both relaxed, you might find that a brilliant solution to an existing problem seems to dawn on you out of nowhere. Jot down this brainstorm the moment it pops into your head so you don't forget the details. The goal is to work smarter, not harder.","Devoting time to a book, movie, or interesting new subject that someone recommended to you could inspire you in unexpected ways. The introspection it brings might compel you to lighten your heart by releasing a long-held grudge. Forgiving someone who hurt you doesn’t mean you have to invite them back into your life, it means you're finally releasing their power over you. Once this happens, you can build more of the loving and supportive relationships you desire. Let worthy people into your life.","Although you might pride yourself on placing more value on experiences than objects, that doesn’t make you indifferent to the material side of life. Today you may finally want to spend a little on something you've had your eye on that you think will bring you happiness. Although people who know you might be surprised by this gesture, take any of their comments in stride. You’re still the honest and open-minded person you’ve always been, and you might feel more balanced by treating yourself.","Although an unexpected issue may arise today, your ability to exhibit grace under pressure will go a long way. Not only can your calm and confident approach lead to a solution that works for everyone involved, but it can also bring a lot of admiration your way. Once you've done your best to put out this fire, allow yourself some time to hang out with a good friend or pursue one of your favorite activities just for fun. Your diligence is admirable, but you also need pleasure to truly feel balanced.","You could have a frustrating experience with an authority figure today, but before you jump into a battle, sneak off to a quiet place where you can hear yourself think. You have great instincts and using them to come up with a plan can make you more successful in handling this matter. Rather than fixating on this person's difficult qualities, do your best to concentrate on their strengths so you can win them over with kindness instead of engaging in a power struggle. Be the one to take the high road.","At one point you might have had a tendency to see yourself as unworthy of happiness and abundance, but some hard work on your self-esteem has hopefully brought you to a more confident place. When you believe you deserve the best, the opportunities you crave are much easier to manifest. No matter how far you've come on your journey, reward yourself today for not giving up on yourself. If you receive any compliments, don't deflect them -- let them sink into your soul and inspire you to keep going."
2021-11-09,"We have a glorious opportunity to put people at ease today and get them to support us in our own endeavors as the industrious Capricorn Moon makes supportive angles to the energetic Sun, psychic Neptune, and compelling Pluto. Rather than wasting time on small tasks or petty matters, it’s best to pursue a lofty goal. The bigger the dream, the more satisfying the journey can be. Once Luna moves into sociable Aquarius at 10:03 pm EST, connecting with our soul tribe becomes both a possibility and a priority.","Professional and financial security could be within your grasp today, but you might need to rein in your rebellious ways and adopt a more buttoned-up approach. Regardless of the type of work you desire, it will be easier to convince people that you're the right person for the job if you maintain an air of responsibility and respect. Be sure to research the company ahead of time and ask questions that show your interest. Afterward, you can ease up with the people who know and love the real you.","You could feel a strong pull toward unknown destinations and an urge to expand your horizons right now. If travel is off the table, taking an intriguing class or joining a book club can not only stretch your intellect but also introduce you to exciting new people. Each person is bound to bring a unique perspective to the material and you may really enjoy being a part of the robust conversations that ensue. Learning and growing can really revive your spirit.","Partnerships of all kinds are supported for you in a big way today, but especially alliances with a professional collaborator or coworker. In the past, you may have been reluctant to join forces with someone for work matters, but you could now cross paths with a person who both excites your imagination and improves your game. Don't spend the whole day focused on work, though. Making some time to connect with your best friend can help put life in proper perspective and balance.","Even if you tend to hide your heart beneath a tough shell, you could be inspired to show your lighter side today. Someone in a position of authority who would normally intimidate you can actually help you open up. Instead of taking a serious approach with them, you might find yourself making jokes and sharing personal stories. Your change in demeanor could astonish others, but it will likely feel natural to you, as it allows you to lean on your nurturing instincts. This encounter may be quite inspiring.","Although you tend to be a creative type, Leo, focusing on a task that requires neatness and precision to detail will be a great use of your time today. Not only will the hours fly by, but this can also help you develop a reputation of being well-rounded. Your excellent performance could even be rewarded with a promotion or other opportunity that allows you to use your artistic and imaginative talents and actually enjoy working. Everyone around you will likely notice that your mood starts to improve.","Delving into a hobby or talent for sheer pleasure can do a lot for your spirit today. Although you may also have work to attend to, be sure to carve out some time to cater to your artistic side. If you’re stuck for inspiration, spending time with a loved one or with a fellow artist could spark some brilliant ideas. Expressing your creativity can feel like being let off a leash, and you will probably enjoy this feeling so much that you start making more time for it in your schedule.","You may be grappling with a domestic situation right now, but you shouldn't overthink it. Whether you’re looking for a new place to live, picking out a bed, or trying to find a repair professional, it’s best to move quickly. Instead of making endless lists of pros and cons, close your eyes and turn your energy inward -- your inner voice will point you in the right direction. Once this matter is off your plate, you'll probably feel a sense of freedom, so release your inhibitions and do something enjoyable.","Although Scorpios tend to have an introverted streak, being in the company of people who love and admire you can bring out your playful side. Colleagues and acquaintances who only see your surface personality would be shocked to see you laughing uproariously with these kindred spirits! Today, you could attract the attention of someone who you connect with right away and be eager to get to know them better. Instead of feeling the need to put up your guard, you could feel unusually comfortable in their presence.","You might be spending a lot of your energy filling a certain role, only to realize it doesn’t mean that much to you. If you’re not getting the respect you deserve, it's OK to call it quits and turn your attention toward something you actually enjoy. Getting involved in your neighborhood or community could bring you a lot of satisfaction, and others will likely appreciate your hard work and upbeat presence. How nice it will be to feel valued! You have a knack for building bridges, so use this to everyone's advantage.","Embracing your personal power probably gives you a thrill -- as a Capricorn, you’re not afraid of a good argument. You might have the nerve to challenge authority today in a way that shocks others, but that’s because they don’t understand that being assertive is what drives you. When you propose doing things a different way, everyone else might simply fall in line. As long as your assertion doesn't come across as aggression, establishing yourself as the top dog could attract fresh opportunities that will benefit your future.","A chance to escape the rat race could fall into your lap today, and you'd be wise to seriously consider it. Although you probably like working with others, that doesn't mean you like being told what to do. Being able to make your own rules will bring you more freedom and allow you to associate with whomever you want. Still, well-meaning friends might express concerns about your financial security, and having a backup plan is probably a good idea. Luckily, your innovative mind could dream up all sorts of solutions.","As a Pisces, defending the underdog is a natural extension of your sympathetic nature, and today, you may be compelled to stand up against a social injustice. Others might step aside while you step up to demand equal treatment for everyone involved. This brave stance may both excite and confuse people who are used to seeing your timid side, but watching you turn into a fireball could be a thrill! Still, exerting all this energy can be exhausting, so once the excitement dies down, allow yourself some quiet solitude."
2021-11-10,"An intense drive for achievement could push us forward thanks to perfectionist Mercury's conjunction with competitive Mars that makes us feel compelled to win at all costs. This is compounded by Mercury's square to pessimistic Saturn, which can cause us to imagine problems where none exist. On top of all that, a tense square between Mars and Saturn might make it feel like we're trying to sprint through quicksand! Instead of trying to beat the clock, it would be best to work slowly and methodically.","Playing a supporting role isn't a sign of weakness. Remember that today while ambitious Mars, your ruling planet, makes a challenging angle to serious Saturn from your shared resource sector. To avoid pride getting in the way of progress, you may need to be willing to take the back seat to a partner. Relinquishing control can let you and the other person involved reach a mutual goal much faster. Strengthening finances, making commitments, and improving your health are all among the possibilities.","Everyone needs to feel valued and appreciated, particularly right now. Although your work ethic is admirable, it may be causing some friction between you and a close friend. If you keep acting as though work is more important than people, you could become very lonely. You might be telling them that you're too busy with career matters more often than you realize! Consider the time you spend with friends versus your time at work -- you may want to start scaling back your hours.","Learning new tasks may take a little longer than you expected today, and pressuring yourself to be excellent on the first try will probably only delay your mastery. Manage your expectations carefully and don't be afraid to ask for help! The suggestion of a teacher or mentor may seem unusual, but giving it a try could lead to a fabulous breakthrough. Try to avoid being overly rigid and, instead, treat learning like gardening. Once the seeds are planted, let nature take its course.","There's no reason to be jealous of another person's skill level, especially when they've been at it much longer than you. If you apply yourself starting now, hard work can get you on that same road to greatness! Once you embark on a new learning process, don't quit until you've reached your goal. Instead of feeling resentment toward someone who has the skills you desire, think about reaching out to them for a collaboration. You each have unique talents that have been honed over time, and you could produce amazing work together.","You may be feeling pressure on multiple different fronts right now, but the biggest challenge might come from someone you're very close with who thinks you're acting childish when you feel like nothing could be further from the truth. Take comfort in knowing that you do take your responsibilities very seriously, Leo, you just aren't the type to let duties get you down. Instead of trying to comfort this person by adopting a serious attitude, keep smiling -- your mood could be contagious and they might start feeling more optimistic as well.","Putting off any stressful work could just make things worse today. You might have an easier time handling difficult tasks if you approach them with humor rather than dread. The more lighthearted your approach is, the faster you can cross things off your to-do list! A family member or supervisor may disapprove of your methods -- but they won't complain about the results. We all have coping mechanisms to get us through tough times, and others have no right to judge what works for you.","In a quest to make more money, you might be neglecting a partner or someone else who's dependent on you. There's nothing wrong with wanting abundance, particularly since your ruling planet is luxury-loving Venus! Keep in mind, though, that the best kind of wealth can often be found through quality time with your loved ones. Although cultivating financial wealth is a possibility for you, it might require a change in attitude -- before you devote more of your time to this endeavor, ask yourself why you're doing it in the first place.","Your level of intensity right now may be alarming to family members who are more easygoing. They could have a hard time understanding why you take things personally, while you don't comprehend their passivity on bigger issues. This might be a day when meeting in the middle is harder than usual, so consider simply agreeing to disagree and moving on. Until things have cooled off, you may want to keep these relationships distant but cordial. A difference in moods is no reason for a fight!","It's frustrating to be placed in a situation with no guidance or support, but that might be right where you are today! You may have no choice but to figure things out as you go along. Fortunately, your intelligence and adaptability can help you spin straw into gold. Even if others are acting jealous, don't let their insecurities damage your own optimistic ideals. Instead, take an upbeat approach and let that help you find long-lasting triumph, no matter what you're working on.","Friction in your social circle may rub you the wrong way today. You might disapprove of the way certain friends spend money, especially if they ask you for loans when they're short on cash. There isn't anything wrong with setting boundaries, but try not to pass too much judgment on the people you care about -- they may be dealing with problems you've never experienced and aren't aware of. If you want to offer financial relief, consider giving it as a gift to avoid future complications.","Professional ambition can undermine your natural zest for life today, so you may not want to pour all your energy into work. Consider cultivating your passion for hobbies, people, and causes that have nothing to do with your job -- you might be surprised to discover that success in these areas leads to success in your career as well. If you're still determined to get a high-powered position or complete a prestigious project, you can almost always lean on your loved ones for emotional support.","Second-guessing your plans could make a potentially easy transition much more difficult at the moment. Instead of imagining exactly how, when, and where things will unfold, picture yourself enjoying the desired result. Whether you crave the contentment of a home, the exhilaration of working a dream job, or the satisfaction of completing a life goal, imagine what you want and manifest it into the universe. If doubt creeps in, swat it away like an annoying fly! Nothing paves the way to success like faith."
2021-11-11,"It's not easy reconciling our minds with our hearts when the willful Sun squares the emotional Moon today. Everybody may seem especially stubborn, and trying to reach a compromise could feel like a waste of time and energy. We might want to retreat and simply wait for all the resistance to pass. Fortunately, Luna teams up with upbeat Jupiter at 2:52 pm EST, helping us find joy in unexpected places. Trying out new creative activities, sports, or love languages could be liberating!","Unconventional ideas may drive a wedge between you and your more conventional friends today. No matter how firmly convinced you are that your perceptions are correct, it's unnecessary to drive your point home, so try to be respectful of their opinions. In time, you might be proven correct -- but you also might not be! Either way, it's OK not to agree on everything with all of your friends. Besides, Aries, you prefer to be ahead of the curve rather than stuck at the back of the herd.","Having the respect of your peers is important, but not always possible. It could feel like more than one rival is trying to put obstacles between you and your goal at the moment. Still, your best bet is to pretend that this opposition doesn't exist and go for the gold! Even if you don't get what you want, you will gain valuable experience. Ignoring any bad attitudes from your competitors can also establish you as the kind of person who keeps their eyes on the prize, regardless of setbacks.","A thirst for knowledge may inspire you to dive deep into researching a fascinating subject. It could feel amazing to sink your teeth into an intricate research project like this today, even if it causes the people around you to shake their heads or accuse you of wasting time. The confusion is probably mutual -- you might not have any idea how people can show so little interest in the world around them! Don't let their opinions hold you back from expanding your mind and broadening your horizons.","You might be worried about sharing your resources with someone else today, as you've likely worked hard to get to where you are in life. The idea of being responsible for anyone else's stability may make you nervous about your own ability to maintain this support. Right now, though, the universe is supporting you when it comes to nurturing someone who needs it. Whether you are giving them money, somewhere to stay, or supportive words, just make sure it comes from the heart.","Two heads are better than one! If you've been having trouble making progress toward a dream of yours, start collecting references of people you could partner with in this endeavor. Most people you've worked with in the past likely admire your Leonine tenacity and optimism and would relish the chance to work alongside you or support you as a benefactor. Having someone else in the picture can allow you to focus on the tasks you love best, giving you more optimism as you work toward your goal.","You have a lot of willpower, Virgo, and your drive to always improve yourself is admirable. If you've recently been able to overcome a difficult health problem or a major issue at work, reward yourself today for a job well done. Splurging on something special you've had your eye on or taking or a short trip somewhere you've always wanted to go can boost your mood and give you the energy to keep going. If anyone delivers any backhanded compliments about your progress, just brush off their jealousy. You earned this!","The creativity within you is shining right now and you may be eager for a chance to show off your work. Even if you're normally content to sit back and let bolder people perform, today, your enthusiastic efforts could really pay off -- perhaps even with an opportunity for a new income stream. You may not get the money you feel like you deserve right away, but be patient! Good things come to those who wait, and this is just the beginning.","Your powerful personality can be intimidating, Scorpio, particularly right now. Remember this if you have the chance to help a loved one who is more timid than you. Instead of judging or poking fun at their efforts, offer some encouragement. Everyone is destined to make mistakes in the beginning, but they'll soon improve. Besides, you've likely messed up at some point in your life as well! When they achieve their goal, no matter what it is, the two of you can celebrate their success as a team.","Something about the unknown may really appeal to your sense of adventure right now. Let your courage inspire you to dive into murky waters after the pearls of knowledge that lie beneath the surface. If you're faced with a task you've never performed before, don't be afraid to roll up your sleeves and get to work. Many of the skills you need to master can probably be acquired through online tutorials or other nonconventional means, so look around. Having faith in yourself could pay off handsomely!","Abandoning yourself to sensual pleasure might be a smart choice today, even if others disagree. Someone with your earthy Capricorn nature shouldn't have to deny a desire for pleasure. Unfortunately, you may have friends who think life should be a struggle and resent what they see as frivolous behavior. Luckily, you've got cosmic permission to turn a deaf ear to any of their opinions about your decadent behavior! By following your heart and working hard, you've earned these rewards.","New ground lies ahead of you right now, ready for you to build a fresh foundation. Although others may worry that you're being too risky, you have all the faith necessary to forge into an emerging field. As long as you know what you're getting into, it's OK if the learning curve is steep or if authority figures are skeptical. Even if you don't succeed in the way you hope, the experience will still be valuable -- and no one will be able to accuse you of being ruled by fear!","It's time to invite your inner artist out to play. Even if you don't normally consider yourself a creative person, you can still have lots of fun making things. Don't worry about looking unpracticed -- that's part of the appeal! Everyone can create something, and your fresh ideas might inspire those around you. Experienced creators may envy the casual fun you can have making whatever you want, and you never know what opportunities or connections will happen thanks to your open and upbeat attitude."
2021-11-12,"We have a golden opportunity to make our dreams come true today thanks to a blissful trine between the determined Sun and idealistic Neptune at 11:24 am EST. Anyone who reaches for the stars is practically bound to grab one -- this is not a time for doing mundane chores! A supportive sextile between the intuitive Pisces Moon and luxurious Venus further emphasizes this magical moment, as does the trine between Luna and ardent Mars. Passion projects, luxurious experiences, and creative endeavors are all favored.","You may be filled with confidence today, allowing you to take risks that make others gasp with fear! Let your heart drive you onward toward a daring financial or personal goal. The universe is supporting you now, whether you want to take a chance on a new business, begin an enticing project, or maybe leave a secure life for something completely different. The important thing is to follow your heart, wherever it leads -- even if it's simply to a quiet day of self-reflection.","Collaboration could lead you to great places at the moment, as a group of fellow creatives may want you to join their ranks. Although you might be reluctant to give up your independence, you could really enjoy becoming part of this team. Working in conjunction with others could help you get the emotional and financial support you've needed for important projects. When you share the duties, you have more time to focus on crafting inspiring work that can get noticed and make a difference.","The spotlight is trained firmly on you now, making this a great time to show off your exceptional talents. If you've been seeking a job, you could get called for an interview or asked for work samples. Don't obsess too much over what you should say or submit, because you could hit the jackpot by trusting your hunches. The same principle holds true in other areas of your life -- don't be afraid to let your intuition and adaptable nature lead the way!","The universe is enhancing your caring instincts and encouraging you to take a newcomer or a friend who's having some trouble under your wing. You could have great advice to help them polish their raw talent into a shining diamond. While they might initially resist your suggestions and cling stubbornly to the way they've always done things, do your best to stay by their side. Soaring up the ladder of success will be far more satisfying if you aren't doing it alone!","Finding ways to transport your mind to a fantasy land is strongly advised right now. Someone with your powerful imagination can't thrive if you're always bogged down by boring tasks! Taking breaks to indulge in fun could make you happier and improve the quality of your work. It's possible that a seemingly unfriendly peer will be drawn to your free spirit like a magnet, leading to a relationship that's a fascinating study in contrasts. Your differing styles might help you work together in surprising ways.","Gentleness cloaks this day like a soft blanket, particularly when it comes to your relationships. Your personal quest for perfection may be exhausting to your nearest and dearest, so today, if you feel compelled to criticize someone, try to sincerely compliment them instead. Your keen observations about their skills, choices, or attitude could be greatly appreciated, and they may return the nicety in surprising ways. Even if they don't, kindness can still be its own reward.","Cultivating feelings of well-being can do a lot to improve your health today. This may sound simplistic, but it's worth trying! Instead of focusing on aches, weakness, or exhaustion, do everything in your power to savor sensual pleasures. This could include anything from a delicious meal to a scented bath or a nice nap. The more you immerse yourself in positivity, the better you should feel. Slowly but surely, any lost vitality may return, making you happier, more hopeful, and more productive.","The universe is encouraging you to step out of your comfort zone and search for an exciting adventure today. You could easily attract someone to join you, as people will find it nearly impossible to resist your dark, Scorpionic air of mystery. Whatever journey you embark upon could bring you to an empowering realization that leads to breakthroughs in other areas of your life as well. As doors open, you can gain a renewed internal power that allows you to express yourself with more honesty and confidence.","Building a solid domestic foundation is a real possibility at the moment. Putting in the down payment on a place, moving in with someone new, or rearranging your current household could help to bring more comfort to your life. Don't let fear get in the way of growth -- even if you had a difficult childhood, you have the capacity to create a blissful home life of your own. Simply listen to your instincts and you can make an environment that truly works for you.","A gift for putting others at ease can make you very popular today, so gathering with others could be a wise move. In addition to possibly making new friends, you might connect with some influential people! Talking to people with all sorts of differing opinions can help you relax some rigid opinions of your own and appreciate fresh points of view. Don't fear change -- your willingness to evolve is a sign of maturity and growth, not a weakness.","Ambition is the name of the game today, so set your sights on your goals and get ready to move toward them. If you intend on a new endeavor becoming a steady source of income, it may take a while, but if you trust your intuition and put in the effort, you can make great strides in that direction. No matter how you choose to spend your working hours, your innovative approach can make it work for you! With faith in your abilities, you can weather any storm.","You can be utterly captivating under today's radiant light, Pisces. Take this opportunity to call in any favors, make daring plans, and plant fresh seeds, because the universe wants to help you. You could have a very good chance to learn something new or expand your horizons in some way. A well-connected friend might even be able to pull some strings for you in return for help you've given them in the past. Seize every opportunity you have with both hands!"
2021-11-13,"Just when we think we've settled on a plan, the universe pulls the rug out from under us! Restless Mercury opposes rash Uranus at 10:57 am EST today, making it difficult to cultivate stability. In situations like this, it's best to be prepared for anything, as flexibility could ease our stress. Final decisions may seem unshakable, but they might not last long. In the end, though, a cozy conjunction between the nurturing Moon and soothing Neptune can soothe any of the day's aches.","Current conditions could make your foundations feel rather shaky. A financial deal may disappoint you by falling through at the last minute, but just because money isn't coming through this channel doesn't mean it will never arrive. Keep your feelers out for other opportunities! A new job opportunity or side hustle may provide the income you want, but if that isn't an option for you, don't worry -- your exceptional talent and hard work can still help you through any uncertainty.","Erratic behavior may cause problems in a close relationship at the moment. It isn't fair to send mixed signals to a kind person, even if you don't mean to. You can show them that you value their companionship by being more mindful about your words and deeds. Consider finding a healthier outlet for any frustrations, like taking brisk walks, working on creative projects, or doing other activities that center your mind. A calmer approach and better mood make it much easier to be a good friend.","After being incredibly patient, you could be passed up for a job or other opportunity today. A light-hearted Gemini like you rarely gets angry, but this may be an exception to the rule. Instead of exploding, try to take any setbacks with a grain of salt and find a productive outlet for your frustrations, such as pouring your energy into a cathartic personal project. Allow yourself to get swept into a world of your own imagination and know that better things lie ahead.","Big changes may begin today -- you might even find that a lifelong dream of yours suddenly no longer holds your interest. This realization could be stressful, but it's OK to change and grow over the years. Be gentle and patient with yourself while figuring out your new needs and pursuing different goals. Certain friends may fall by the wayside as well, simply because you don't have much in common with them anymore. It might be difficult, but releasing these outmoded relationships can make room for even better ones in the future.","Mixed signals may cause confusion now, especially if a powerful person in your life has been telling you one thing and doing another. Dishonesty can be a red flag for other character flaws, so it might be time to release yourself from their influence in whatever way you can. The process could be nerve-wracking, but try reaching out to a friend who has had experience with such matters. They'll likely jump at the chance to help you out of a tough situation.","One of the most empowering things you can do for yourself is to learn ways to manage your feelings during times of trial. Setbacks could abound today, but dwelling on any injustices will just waste your valuable time and energy. Don't let an unfair decision break your heart! Instead, try to turn your attention to a relationship that brings you joy. Going on a big road trip or a small outing with a close friend could both make for welcome diversions.","Some deeply held convictions could be challenged right now -- but they might even not be yours! Despite what's often the popular belief, you can enjoy a contented life without working around the clock. You know you're capable of working to live, rather than living to work. Remember all the blessings you already have, even if they don't include a prestigious career or the latest and greatest possessions. No matter how simple your life may be, all that matters is that it makes you happy.","Expecting others to satisfy your needs could lead to disappointment today, so you may need to look within for the happiness you seek. Cultivating contentment might become easier if you train your focus on things that spark joy. When someone doesn't treat you with respect, gravitate toward other people who make you feel good. Rather than waiting for a text, turn off your phone and take a walk through the park. Changing your mindset can improve your circumstances faster than you think!","Your natural vitality could feel compromised at the moment, but the cause of it might not be obvious at first glance. Try to treat a health setback as a course correction -- when you feel achy or tired, it may be a sign that you need to sort out some upsetting feelings. Ask yourself if you need to release some resentment, for yourself or others. Of course, you should always get medical treatment for physical problems, but attending to your emotional fitness is equally important.","It may feel like the deck is stacked against you right now. Even so, make an effort to be supportive of a loved one if they're experiencing fabulous success. The universe is endlessly bountiful, and someone else having a stroke of luck doesn't mean that you'll be deprived of one, yourself! Make it your mission to celebrate happy events, even when they don't affect you. The more joyful you are, the easier it should be for abundance to flow into your life.","The comfort of home versus the rewards of a career might make you feel torn in two today. Professional demands could be wreaking havoc with your personal life, and it may be time to decide whether you prefer a high-pressure job or a happy home. There's nothing wrong with wanting either, but it's important to be honest with yourself. You have the capacity to be very successful in both areas, yet this may involve ignoring conventional wisdom. Forge your own way and see what happens!","Be careful what you wish for right now -- you just might get it! That said, someone with your powers of manifestation shouldn't play it safe when picturing your goals. Rather than envisioning a steady job, imagine yourself in your dream career or taking charge of an exciting project. You might want to let inspiration rule your days rather than setting a reliable routine. The excitement these aspirations generate in your heart can help you have the energy and determination necessary to achieve them."
2021-11-14,"After a period of rest and reflection, we can finally charge forward. A burst of energy arrives at 10:48 am EST when the instinctual Moon moves into rambunctious Aries. We can find ourselves embarking on an adventure, issuing a challenge, or declaring our desires with more defiance than usual. Although our bold moods might mean that conflict is lurking around every corner, we could also discover what it feels like to be assertive in a positive way. The time to hesitate is through!","A calming influence settles over you today as the emotional Moon moves into your sign. You may be the only member of the zodiac who is cool and collected at this time, allowing you to have the courage of your convictions and go after what you want without hesitation. This is an especially good day to radically change your look! Getting a different hairstyle, finding a new style of clothing, or even researching a tattoo could be amazingly refreshing.","It could feel like everyone's pressuring you to pick up the pace today, and you may greatly resent this interference and insist on doing things your own way. If the noise becomes too much to bear, try retreating to a private corner where you can work alone and hear yourself think. Meeting any deadline should be much easier when you feel centered. When you finally finish any duties, go ahead and give yourself a reward for beating the clock.","Opposites attract today and this might be especially noticeable when you're out with friends or at a casual get-together. You may love sparring with someone who tries to push your buttons in a teasing way. To onlookers, it could appear like the two of you are really at odds, but as long as you're both having a good time, this kind of banter can be invigorating. All friendships are different, and this might just be the way the two of you relate.","Pursuing your goals and forging powerful relationships could pay off handsomely. While people might mistake your classic Cancerian sensitivity for timidity, there's actually a lot of tenacity stored up within you. You know how strong you are and the awesome things that you're capable of doing, so don't settle when you know you can succeed. Whether you want to expand your intellectual horizons, form a collaborative partnership, or begin an exciting personal project, you have support from the universe right now.","Instigating a change in your life can be really beneficial right now -- it's a great day to venture into unknown territory! While you may usually prefer to luxuriate in the sun than brave the cold winds of indifference, you won't grow if you stay inside your comfort zone. Give yourself permission to try a new hobby, visit an unfamiliar place, or learn a cutting-edge skill. You might feel awkward at first, but that's to be expected -- no one is immediately good at everything. Be kind to yourself.","There's an exciting energy about you today that could turn a lot of heads in your direction. You can use this magnetism to connect with someone you find intriguing, whether it's for business, romantic, or friendly purposes. Don't be afraid to approach them because the universe is favoring bold actions right now. Even if you two are opposite in many ways, this dynamic can be quite thrilling and even beneficial if you appreciate each other's strengths.","You might feel a sense of urgency pushing you along today, so get straight to the point with any matters that arise. You might have an encounter with a difficult person, and while Libras aren’t the type to cause friction, you don't have endless patience either. Instead of deferring to others, state your opinions with calm confidence. Getting your needs met is more likely when you make yourself heard instead of waiting for anyone else to read your mind.","You might have been so wrapped up with personal matters recently that you accidentally neglected some of your chores. Although stocking your fridge, doing laundry, and paying bills may not seem like the most exciting way to spend your day, if you whistle while you work, you'll likely end up with a great sense of relief and accomplishment. After your to-do list is complete, do something that makes you feel good like getting some physical activity or catching up with a friend so you don't feel like the whole day was devoted to work.","Your creativity is soaring today and an invigorating sense of confidence can help push you along. Be sure to pursue pleasure in some form because it can really lift your spirits and even boost your self-esteem right now. As a Sagittarius, you tend to welcome the challenge of learning something new, and today is the perfect day to take a risk like this. If you'd rather take it easy, then just spend the day playing games, expressing yourself, and laughing with loved ones. You deserve to feel good.","Life at home could be more exciting than usual today. If you tend to spend your weekends doing the same things, this is a great opportunity to try something new. Taking on a bold renovation or redecorating project could help to inject fresh life into your living space that energizes you well beyond today. Or you may just want to get in the kitchen and try making an ambitious recipe for the first time. Don't worry if you don't know exactly what you're doing, just enjoy the process!","You're blessed with a big boost of confidence today that can help to turn a great idea of yours into something more. If you tend to find that people shun your ideas because they seem too far-fetched or out-there, today you can start to prove them wrong. Although you may want to get straight to work, thinking things through and communicating your plans should be the first step. When others understand and have faith in what you're doing, they'll be more likely to leave you alone so you can work your magic.","A sudden expense may arise that could feel like a bother right away, but it might turn out to be a little exciting and beneficial. If something breaks down, upgrading to a newer form of technology can actually make your life easier. Even if you think you could go without it for a while, do some price shopping, because you may be able to find a great deal that you'll miss out on if you wait too long. Plus, you'll probably enjoy having something shiny and new."
2021-11-15,"Flattery won't get us anywhere as the moody Moon squares off with vain Venus. Being direct is probably a safer idea, especially with authority figures. Sticking strictly to business can move stalled projects ahead and save everyone time and money, especially when a tense square between the egotistical Sun and excessive Jupiter lands at 2:58 pm EST, which could easily blow things out of proportion. Beware of taking silly jokes and offhanded remarks personally! When in doubt, it's better to laugh than lash out.","Your heart and head could be arguing about today's conflicting vibrations. A friend may come to you for help, but if it's financial help they need, it's probably best to respond with a polite but firm ""no."" Although you probably want to help your loved one out of a difficult situation, providing monetary assistance could make their problem worse. A better thing you can do for them is to cultivate a belief in their ability to fix the situation themselves. You may not realize how much your opinion means to them!","Commanding the spotlight might cause resentment at the moment. If you've been working as part of a team, everyone has probably put in a lot of time and effort and they deserve credit for their actions. If you're asked to accept a reward on behalf of the group, be sure to acknowledge all the contributors involved. It's especially important to recognize those who have been performing background tasks that are often overlooked. By treating this as a collective victory, you could be seen with newfound respect.","Big egos could rub each other the wrong way right now, and acting like the resident expert may annoy those around you. Instead of trying to teach people your way of doing things, let them develop their own methods. Your relationships will likely feel much smoother if you stay in your own lane for now. A better way to eventually prove that you're right would be to get further training that backs up your ideas. You can return to any arguments later with more evidence.","Although being self-reliant could seem intimidating, the universe is on your side today -- you are probably much more capable than you think! If you're wanting or needing to increase your income, try to seek out some unique or modern methods. You might even want to try working for commission or in another type of flexible work environment. Thanks to your genuine care, you could discover a knack for knowing the kind of products and services that people really want.","Keeping an open mind could be challenging but enriching today. Just because you were raised with certain beliefs doesn't mean everyone else must share them, so if you meet someone who has radically different values, don't shut them out! Being in this person's orbit could be liberating. Instead of judging others for not measuring up to your ideals, allow yourself to befriend people from all walks of life. You'll likely end up with a wider circle of people who want to be around you if you approach relationships with an open-minded attitude.","Practicing moderation is strongly advised today, as your body and mind may feel more delicate than usual. Beware of overindulging in food and drink -- it's OK to splurge on occasion, but remember that you'll get out what you put in when it comes to nutrition. You might want to put some distance between you and someone who seems like they always put you in the path of temptation. Gravitate toward friends who value their own wellness instead, because they'll be more likely to support yours as well.","There's nothing wrong with having expensive tastes, but you might have to make some changes if your income doesn't support your desired lifestyle. Whether you choose to scale back your spending or look for a job that can accommodate your spending habits, let your impressive charisma and your natural affinity for balance help you move forward. With time and determination, you can either create a workable budget or land a position that allows you to afford your more luxurious needs.","Others may come across as a bit cold at this time, and it can be particularly hurtful if you feel your family doesn't understand you. Rather than seeking their approval, focus on satisfying your own needs, even if you sense their resistance. They could feel threatened by your defiance, unable to see that you're simply trying to assert your own values, not challenge theirs. Your path is your own and there's nothing wrong with wanting a different lifestyle than your loved ones lead.","When it comes to relationships, this might be the time to promise less than you intend to deliver. Resist the temptation to tell anyone that you can meet an incredibly tight deadline because it'll be much easier to produce good work when you're not trying to rush things. It's possible the person who asks for your help will try to make you feel guilty for not agreeing to their outrageous demands, but stand up for yourself and don't take the bait!","Tension between your personal and professional lives could be strong now, as your friends might be bothered by your quest for financial success. Although there's nothing wrong with wanting the finer things in life, you shouldn't confine all your discussions to material matters. You're a vibrant individual with many interests! Limit your conversations about work and make a point to share more about your hobbies, relationships, and experiences. You can always talk shop with coworkers who share your desire for abundance -- know your audience and tailor conversations accordingly.","People could accuse you of being selfish today, especially when it comes to your career, and you might actually agree with this assessment. Your dreams probably mean a lot to you, even if following them means postponing relationships, moving far away, or getting judged by others. The prospect of a limited future may be far more frightening to you than any risk. It's OK to pour your energy into cultivating success, but don't forget to have some fun along the way!","Even if you'd prefer to stay home instead of socializing today, it may be best for you to get out and circulate -- you never know when an encounter with a friend or someone you meet will trigger a wonderful idea. Scribble down any brainwaves as soon as they occur, because this concept could end up being quite valuable. Keep this experience in mind the next time you feel the urge to isolate yourself, too -- the connections you keep can benefit you on so many levels!"
2021-11-16,"Lucky breaks are more possible than ever thanks to the impulsive Aries Moon sextiling fortunate Jupiter! That being said, a tense angle between Luna and intimate Pluto warns us against ignoring boundaries with others -- this is not the time to take things too far or make promises we can't keep. Still, some experimentation is appropriate when a sextile between the inspiring Sun and Pluto slides into place at 4:01 pm EST. Once the Moon enters placid Taurus this evening, our minds, bodies, and moods can all start to relax.","Championing your friends can strengthen your relationships with them as the careful Moon in your sign emphasizes your natural protective instincts. It's important to let them know that defying rules and authority isn't always a bad idea -- sometimes it's essential to their personal growth. Your belief in their abilities might also inspire you to make a courageous move toward your own goals. A bold change might feel uncomfortable at first, but you could end up very glad you took the plunge.","Your easygoing nature is taking over today! If you're able to have a fun day today -- even if you're only able to get off work a little early -- invite someone along who shares your interest in indulging your body and senses. Get a pedicure together, chat over a glass of wine, or enjoy a delicious meal at an exotic restaurant. While more traditional types might think that the two of you are frivolous, don't let them drag you down; you work hard and deserve time to balance yourself.","You could be feeling relief right now thanks to some improvements at work or in your daily routine. This newfound sense of freedom can help you become much more productive, especially if you're able to handle your duties in a more relaxed way than before. Ideas tend to flow freely when you aren't anxious about meeting strict expectations or censoring your behavior. Even if your methods aren't popular with others at first, your success over time will be all the proof they need to see.","You may feel especially empowered to explore your creative side right now, and you shouldn't hesitate to do so! If you work in a very professional environment or feel confined by certain relationships in your life, it's important you make time for hobbies and personal pleasures that make you feel fulfilled. Still, it might be wise to keep your interests to yourself for now, because the last thing you need is judgmental individuals cramping your style or making you second guess what you truly enjoy.","Finding your dream home or improving relationships within your family might be priorities of yours as your ruling planet, the magnificent Sun, supports magnetic Pluto from your domestic sector. Everyone's idea of perfection is different, so think about what your ideal environment would look and feel like before you start making changes. If money is holding you back from fulfilling your wishes, it may be time to look for a different kind of employment or some kind of side hustle. Even if it takes time, don't take your eyes off the prize.","Your mental capacity is especially strong right now. The more you exercise your brain, the more magnetic you can be, so don't hide your intelligence from the world! Your natural meticulousness can help you pinpoint weak spots in complex systems, making you a valuable player at work or in the community. Keep an eye out for changes that could be made because others will appreciate your ability to improve the flow of things and benefit their lives in the process.","Your happiness is always important, but right now it may be a particular focus of yours. If your living environment or the activities you engage in don't bring you joy, then don't hesitate to make some changes. Redecorating a room in your house where you spend a lot of time or trying out a fun, new hobby can really lift your spirits. Ignore anyone who has anything negative to say, because positive energy is what you're trying to cultivate.","Creativity and communication are incredibly supported for you right now, making it a wonderful time to express yourself. Whether you do so artistically or verbally, let your authentic self be heard. Don't feel like you need to speak or act like anyone else because your Scorpionic intensity can be far more exciting than any mimicry, and your expressions will be more natural and believable when they come from a genuine place. Don't be surprised if people seem to come out of the woodwork to respond.","A freedom-lover like you may be interested in escaping the rat race, and money from an unexpected source can help you do just that. Taking advantage of some freelance work or a nontraditional job could be a welcome alternative to working conventional hours. Although your adventurous approach might make more traditional types uneasy, your attitude toward abundance is likely more balanced than theirs. Where they might hide rewards away after working so hard for them, you know to enjoy it when you've got it!","Even though Capricorns tend to err on the side of predictability and tradition, a more unorthodox path could be calling you today. Establishing and working toward socially-acceptable goals might have worked up until now, but a fresh sense of inspiration can carry you forward, whether it involves a different career, a new place to live, or some other unique choice. Family members who are used to the old you may disapprove of your ideas, but their needs aren't the same as yours. Embrace your capacity for greatness!","Operating behind the scenes can give you the greater sense of independence that you desire. If you've been feeling micromanaged, you'll probably enjoy having more space to explore your radical ideas and methods. Even if you've been shut down in the past when proposing fresh and innovative ways to do things, today you can muster up some confidence and push past your reservations to solve a problem. People with similar concerns might come forward to help as well, and their help may make all the difference.","You could meet a lot of intriguing people by signing up for an interesting class, hobby group, or cultural event. In the past, you may have felt alienated by friends who didn't identify with your deep interest in unique topics, so finding a new tribe that appreciates your passions could be a big relief and give you an overdue sense of belonging. Although the same old friends might still accuse you of wasting your time, they're probably just jealous of your new sense of fellowship, so don't let them bring you down."
2021-11-17,"Traditional structures can begin to crumble when demanding Mars faces off with rebellious Uranus at 12:23 pm EST. We are fed up with oppressive rules that only serve the powerful! While the Taurus Moon's hard aspects to Mars and restrictive Saturn might make some people scorn any efforts to improve society, blockages could still give way to progress when faced with today's liberating energy. Thanks to Luna's supportive angles with indulgent Venus and Uranus, we can empower ourselves by investing in relationships and activities that make life beautiful.","Prepare for some disruptions today! An argument over a pre-established situation could break out, possibly as money or property that was promised to you is withheld at the last minute. To add insult to injury, friends who normally support you might seem unsympathetic to your circumstances and insist you let go of your anger. Stick to your guns! By standing up for what's right, you may not only conquer a bully but also defeat a larger sense of injustice.","Diplomacy may be difficult to maintain today, and it could take every last ounce of your tact to deal with a toxic person in your circle. Provoking them will probably only make it harder to escape their grasp, so it would be wise to avoid their ire until you see an opportunity to completely get them out of your life. This whole situation may cause some upheaval, so reach out to a trusted friend for stability if necessary.","There's a great amount of tension in the air today, making it critical to protect your health. If you aren't careful, your efforts to help someone else could drain all of your energy. While some people may genuinely help, there's no point in sacrificing yourself to a person who is choosing to walk on quicksand. Some people might criticize your decision to stand back, but most should support it, because it isn't your job to rescue someone who doesn't want to be saved.","It may be tempting to retreat into your shell right now. Although you probably aren't in the mood to take orders from anyone, unfortunately, it might be impossible to meet your goals alone or without making some compromises to get ahead. This could mean working with someone who has a strict management style, but doing things according to their instructions may actually help you get some resources you need. Have patience, even if things are a little frustrating.","Expansive energies might cause some discomfort today, especially if you feel like you've outgrown your home. Whether you're fighting with roommates or simply don't have enough space for your belongings, it could be time to consider a move. Depending on how far you go, however, this could also mean making a job transition. Think about enlisting the aid of a life coach who can empower you to pursue your future dreams. The adventurous spirit within you can help you succeed no matter where you are!","Personality clashes could cause arguments today, but debating with someone in charge may be an exercise in futility. If you're told to carry out a senseless plan, it might be best to smile and nod while subtly making your own plans. Don't be insubordinate just because of pride, but if following their instructions could harm innocent people, you may have to take matters into your own hands. Even if you get punished for sneakily breaking the rules, you'll still know that you did the right thing.","Making money doesn't have to be a struggle -- even if it may seem like it does right now. It's hard to escape this belief in such a work-obsessed society. Take today to consider strategies that successful people who don't work a lot have used, such as gaining passive income through things like stocks or real estate. You may also want to focus on your attitude toward the resources you have right now. There might be abundance already in your life that you haven't acknowledged yet!","It may be best to tread lightly while fierce Mars is in your sign and opposing rash Uranus in your 7th House of Others. Unless you get a handle on any anger of yours, some scary conflicts could occur, so sit for a few moments and reflect on what's upsetting you before interacting with people. Whether it's a personal insult or a societal injustice that's causing your pain, your feelings are valid. Instead of acting out, try resolving this pain by expressing more compassion to yourself.","Some upsetting things could come to light right now -- it's possible that you'll discover a terrible secret. Before you lash out at whoever's been deceiving you, consider why they may have misled you. They could have feared your judgment. Although you likely pride yourself on having an open mind, there may have been times when you looked down on those who made decisions that seemed cowardly. Adopting a more sympathetic attitude could give you a chance to strengthen a promising relationship.","The winding path of life could make some unusual turns today. An unpredictable person in your life may drive you to distraction -- even if you usually enjoy the way they surprise you, their behavior could really get under your skin now. Instead of focusing on their shortcomings, try making a quick list of things you love about this individual. Your appreciation can enhance their good points and diminish their bad ones, bringing warmth back to your bond to keep this friendship alive and thriving.","It can be easy to get carried away at the moment, but obtaining power at any cost would probably be a hollow victory. As aggressive Mars opposes your ruling planet, Uranus, you may feel threatened by any challenges to your authority. Instead of punching back, make a strategic retreat. Remind yourself that your power is all your own and utterly unique. While others may not have the capacity to understand your eccentric ways and offbeat ideas, you can be secure in the knowledge that you're an original!","The urge to control others may be powerful now, but just because you feel strongly about an issue doesn't mean that others must follow suit. Although you may not share or even like someone's beliefs, you shouldn't try too hard to convert them. There are more valuable things to do than butt heads with everyone who disagrees with you. Consider using your passion in a creative project instead. Even something as simple as journaling could help you make sense of bewildering events and attitudes."
2021-11-18,"Sweet encounters are visible directly ahead of us as interactive Mercury trines receptive Neptune at 10:38 am EST. This is a great time to expand our social circles to include kind, loving people. Still, the prospect of branching out may be scary when the traditional Taurus Moon forms tough angles to Mercury and expansive Jupiter. Instead, we should embrace Luna's supportive connections with Neptune and transformative Pluto that encourage us to make changes that will add more magic to our lives.","The grass often looks greener on the other side, and it probably seems especially verdant right now. You might have a desire to form a beneficial alliance with someone who captivates your imagination. Friends could be dismayed by your preoccupation with this dream, perhaps feeling jealous of the attention given to your new goals, but don't lose focus of what you truly want. You have the bravery to attain it, although you might need to venture out of your comfort zone.","Charisma pours from you today, enhancing your natural Taurus magnetism and brightening up your sense of humor. You might be able to use your velvet voice to encourage someone to help you out if you're in need of any kind of support. If you can, put work matters in the back seat and focus on your personal desires and having fun with your favorite people. Connections of all kinds have a happy vibe to them and you could get a lot of enjoyment out of this day.","Concentrating on details should be easier than usual right now and your analytical nature could help you produce fantastic work. This is a wonderful time to apply for a dream job, be part of a competition, or add to your personal portfolio. Look for ways to combine contrasting elements in your projects to achieve a truly captivating result. If you're already happy in your career role, consider trying a new creative medium. Adding more tools to your kit can expand your skills and make your confidence soar.","An air of nostalgia could have you looking back fondly on the past, making you want to put a sentimental spin on virtually everything you do. Exploring a new environment or foreign land might be particularly fun to daydream about -- luckily, you don't have to actually leave home to immerse yourself in something enticingly unfamiliar! Learning about a different culture online, through books, or by talking to others could inspire you in incredible ways. You may even be inspired to start planning a trip to somewhere you learn about today.","The urge to set down roots could be very powerful right now. If you've been longing to move somewhere new or buy your dream home, this is a wonderful time to begin that process. Having a private space to retreat and recharge can help to create more stability in your life overall. Be open to viewing properties that aren't exactly what you thought you wanted, because you never know what you might find off the beaten path.","Swirling clouds of curiosity could turn your attention inward as you feel an uncontrollable pull to dive deep into a rabbit hole. Embrace your methodical intelligence by looking further into something you learned about recently, and don't be afraid to get completely wrapped up in the topic. A trip to the library or bookstore may be a great way to spend the day, or you could find what you're looking for online. Keep following this trail, wherever it leads.","You could have found a real knack for spinning straw into gold lately that has resulted in some extra income -- or perhaps you're on the brink of a new job or paid project right now. Even if it's different from anything you've had before, don't let a valuable opportunity slip away! If you end up with a little mad money, consider spending it on something that you love, even if someone else thinks it's frivolous. Your rewards are your own and no one else gets to decide how you enjoy yourself.","Joyous opportunities could pop up at every turn today! While Mercury is in your sign and making a beneficial trine to psychic Neptune in your creativity sector, don't be surprised if someone invites you to join them on a last-minute weekend getaway. It's also possible you'll be inspired to create something beautiful and mysterious -- just like you! You might even develop a new friendship with someone who has similar artistic inspirations to you. Whatever form your good fortune takes, grab it with both hands.","Working solo or staying behind the scenes may be particularly rewarding at the moment. While spending time with others is often energizing, everyone needs to recharge on their own sometimes. If you're too tired to attend a party or work gathering, it's OK to cancel. The host might be disappointed, but your health is more important than pleasing others. If you don't take care of your body, it'll be much harder to be all that you can be.","You could get a lot of joy right now by collaborating on a project with people who share your interests. It'll be a huge relief to feel a sense of belonging, particularly if people have had negative things to say in the past about the way you threw yourself into endeavors they couldn't understand. When you're working with kindred spirits, you can fully embrace the things that inspire you! Let your uniqueness guide you toward a new, more accepting community where you can celebrate each other's different strengths together.","Your skills may be greatly appreciated in a professional field, as an important initiative could need to be handled in a unique, creative way right now. Your naturally innovative approach may encounter resistance from some people, but trust that you know what you're doing -- having confidence in yourself tends to make others confident in you, too. Once your methods are put into practice, they'll probably realize they had no reason to ever doubt you in the first place.","Talking with someone from a background very different than yours could give you a better perspective on your current situation. What seemed like a difficult personal problem might suddenly feel like an advantage! Pisces are especially sensitivity to their surroundings, and this might have caused you both incredible pain and great pleasure throughout life. To encourage and manifest future happiness, try to deliberately immerse yourself in joy rather than sorrow. Living in a state of hope tends to bring more blessings your way."
2021-11-19,"Delightful surprises are in store today thanks to a blissful trine between dazzling Venus and spontaneous Uranus. We might discover a new favorite indulgence or a loved one could bestow us with a lavish gift. The Lunar Eclipse in materialistic Taurus at 3:57 am EST may cause a change in our values as something that was once important becomes insignificant. Thankfully, the effect can be liberating, particularly as the Moon's entry into versatile Gemini makes us more open to change.","A moneymaking endeavor could abruptly come to an end due to today's Lunar Eclipse in your 2nd House of Earned Income, but don't panic! As suddenly as one door closes, another may open, and this one could bring you even greater benefits. There are many who admire your work and someone who can pull some strings might reach out to you with word of an open position that's right up your alley. Even if all this change is unexpected, it could be just what you need to feel more fulfilled.","Greener pastures lie ahead for you, and today's Lunar Eclipse in your determined sign could be the catalyst that sends you toward them. Stop telling yourself you don't have what it takes to enjoy the lifestyle you truly desire!

Today's Lunar Eclipse is sending shockwaves through your 12th House of Secrets that could uncover some deeply hidden information in your life. Fortunately, once the truth of an upsetting matter is faced, you can choose to move forward in a healthier way. Escaping a toxic situation or mindset could cause some uncomfortable instability at first, but the initial pain should be quickly replaced by relief.","Friendships may undergo big changes because of today's Lunar Eclipse in your 11th House of Social Networking. It's possible that you'll fall out of touch with a buddy you've known for years, or someone who you thought was just a friend could reveal that they want something more from you. Whatever changes occur within your tribe should be positive in the end, even if they aren't easy in the moment. Don't stay stuck in a limiting situation to make others happy -- instead, admit what you want and claim it!","Electric energy is flowing through your professional endeavors! A more prestigious set of duties may be handed to you, and today's Lunar Eclipse in your 10th House of Career and Accomplishment can help you have great success with them. Using your vibrant gifts to fulfill your responsibilities could bring you tons of satisfaction -- it'll probably feel amazing to step into your power like this. Remember this feeling any time you feel uncertain about your abilities in the future and your confidence will soar.","Creativity and inspiration are rushing in today. After fulfilling any necessary duties you may have, you'll be ready for some fun! The Lunar Eclipse in your 9th House of Travel and Higher Learning could allow you to put work aside for the moment, and you might want to spend your time visiting a historic location or simply taking a relaxing staycation. This time off to explore the things that you find intriguing can stir some truly unique and beautiful ideas within you.","As a Libra, you may be used to doing most of the giving in your relationships, but that can change right now. Today's Lunar Eclipse in your 8th House of Shared Resources allows you to create more balance when it comes to give-and-take. It's time to focus on your own needs, particularly when it comes to your domestic environment. If you've been longing to implement home improvements, this is a wonderful time to get started. Changing up the decorations and furnishings you surround yourself with can add fresh energy to your life overall.","Instead of looking to someone else for happiness and security, you can create your own contentment here and now. Today's empowering Lunar Eclipse in your 7th House of Partnerships puts tremendous emphasis on self-love. Make an effort to be the sort of person you want to have around you and also to love yourself the way you wish others would love you. When you think about it, you might already possess everything you need to be successful. Let your body, mind, and spirit unite harmoniously!","Your job prospects may become much better at this time thanks to the Lunar Eclipse happening in your work and service sector. A pleasant but tedious position could be replaced with one that requires a lot more creativity. Think broadly and see if you can anticipate people's needs or research new methods of making money. Ideas that seem improbable or unnecessary to a traditional audience could be met with enthusiasm by a younger demographic. Assert your vision for a dynamic way of living, laboring, and loving life!","People may need something from you today, and you might finally be in a position to be there for them. The Lunar Eclipse is helping you wrap up some activities you've been enjoying, allowing you to spend more time with those who need your attention. Friends might really appreciate your comforting presence -- someone may even ask for your advice about a deeply personal matter. Although you might normally suggest that they tread carefully, today you could urge them to break free and take a bold risk instead!","Your domestic life might undergo a dramatic transformation due to today's Lunar Eclipse in your 4th House of Home and Family. You may relocate, add a member to your tribe, or even purchase your own place -- whatever shifts occur could be very spiritually uplifting! You also have a greater opportunity right now to devote time to activities that make you feel centered and complete. Improving your mood by doing things you enjoy will likely improve your relationships with loved ones as well.","You can take your skills from novice to master with the help of today's Lunar Eclipse in your 3rd House of Information and Learning. With your knowledge strengthened, work that might have once been bewildering could come easily to you, or a job that was out of your league may be well within your grasp. If your skills apply to a paying gig, consider asking for more now that you're able to offer more. Your hard work deserves to be rewarded."
2021-11-20,"Monumental change might be easier than usual with the lighthearted Gemini Moon supported by structured Saturn. Venturing into the unknown will likely be stimulating rather than scary, which is great news for anyone tired of the status quo! This energy could help us replace some restrictive rules with more humane ones, allowing everyone to breathe easier. However, as fretful Mercury faces off with exaggerated Jupiter at 6:43 am EST, we'll need to resist the temptation to make mountains out of molehills -- especially in personal relationships.","Teamwork makes the dream work today! If you've been grappling with a problem, reach out to a communicative peer -- they may have some great suggestions for improvements that can help you move forward. Meanwhile, an authority figure could be open to your advice ... if you're willing to butter them up a bit first. In the past, this character may have been resistant to streamlining anything, but if you offer to share the work and credit for this solution, they might finally be ready to implement it.","There are bountiful resources to be found now -- if you know where to look. Making an effort to use quality materials in your work could make an amazing impression on a client or potential professional partner. If you're currently looking for a job, don't be put off by listings that offer something in the lower range of your desired salary. Your negotiation skills are strong and you might be able to work out a better deal in the interview process, once you've shown them how much you have to offer.","Someone in your life who tends to be more reserved than you could start to relax in your lighthearted presence. Cracking a few jokes and talking about non-serious topics can help break the ice and open up more possibility in your relationship, whether it's a professional or personal one. Feeling more relaxed around each other not only makes it easier to get to know one another, but also creates a more supportive environment in which to work, learn, or relate.","Even if you feel like you're out of your depth today, try to project an image of confidence anyway. If you focus on your weaknesses, others probably will too, so turn the attention toward your strengths. Patterning your behavior after a role model you've always admired could open up doors of opportunity to you that were sealed shut before. If anyone tries to bring you down, just respond with a smile and keep moving toward your goal. Sometimes you need to fake it 'til you make it!","Although some people in your life may accuse you of being selfish or stubborn today, in truth, you're probably just firmly convinced that your ideas are genuinely best for everyone. Whether you're right or not, it would be wise to at least listen to other people's opinions, because that could avoid a lot of grumbling along the way. When others feel heard, it'll be easier for all of you to get along and work together toward a common goal.","Accepting and giving good advice can make you a valued member of a team right now. If you're not already a leader, it's likely that many people treat you as such thanks to your logical methods. If a rule or project seems unreasonable, don't be afraid to say so and offer alternatives that could save time, money, and energy. While someone else may worry about being eclipsed by your talent, once they understand your genuine desire to help, any resistance should vanish.","Your natural charm is shining even brighter than usual! Sweet-talking your way into an opportunity just might work out -- let your friendly demeanor do the work for you to get something you've been really wanting. Money could be a bit tight at the moment, but you could have some options. While you may need to take a leap of faith, as long as you keep working hard, resources should appear when you need them. Summon your courage and keep moving forward!","Support from family members might be available today if you ask. A relative could be glad to help you gain greater freedom, so be open to receiving their generosity! Even if you've always considered yourself to be a very self-sufficient person, it's OK to accept help every once in a while. When you give your loved ones a chance to repay the kindness you've shown them in the past, it can make for more balanced relationships overall.","An important person in your life could be very helpful to you right now -- in particular, your best friend, romantic partner, or business partner might have some valuable skills they can share with you. Don't be afraid to ask them for a crash course! Once you learn the ropes, you might develop a newfound respect for their knowledge. Sometimes a person's hidden elements are only revealed when you stop putting labels on what kind of person they are. The more you let others surprise you, the happier your relationships can become.","Invigorating energy could fill your body and mind today, helping to boost your overall health in a very impressive way. Spending a little extra money on your own well-being may pay off handsomely! Even if friends scoff at your efforts to improve yourself, you have the willpower to brush them off and stay focused on your goal. You could see awesome results very soon -- make sure to keep your momentum going, because one victory can lead to many others.","The more confident you are right now, the more successful you can be. Rather than making excuses about why your wild ideas won't work, give them a try! Your accomplishments can show you the wisdom of going against the grain. Plus, going off the beaten path often provides some useful shortcuts. Authority figures might not be a fan of your unique style, but they don't need to know about your plans. Today, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.","Family can be a great resource in times of stress. You might want to talk to a trusted relative about an issue that's been weighing on your heart recently. Their unconditional support could give you the courage to break away from a relationship or life pattern that no longer serves you. They may also help you understand that, while it's kind of you to worry about other people's feelings, you shouldn't sacrifice your own happiness for anyone else's."
2021-11-21,"During times of trouble, there are almost always people who want to help. As the jittery Gemini Moon squares deluded Neptune and trines exaggerating Jupiter, we should resist the temptation to despair over upsetting news stories. Fortunately, thoughtful Mercury's supportive angle to regenerative Pluto helps us do just that. It becomes even easier to be hopeful when the joyous Sun moves into upbeat Sagittarius at 9:34 pm EST. Later, the nurturing Moon enters tender Cancer, helping us choose love over fear.","The chance to expand your horizons is being offered today, but only if you remain on the sunny side of the street. Be strict with your mental diet by surrounding yourself with positive people and avoiding pessimists like the plague. If a situation fills you with a familiar feeling of dread, try putting on some uplifting music, calling a friend who makes you laugh, or watching a fun movie. Soon, your unease should dissolve and your natural zest for life can return. What a relief!","Friends may try to make you feel guilty for pursuing wealth, but as a person who's ruled by luxurious Venus, it's only natural you crave the finer things in life! There's no need to apologize for doing what feels right -- you've got cosmic permission to turn a deaf ear to any criticisms. Being true to yourself may bring a fabulous career opportunity within reach, whether it's something at your current job or an entirely new one. There might even be some travel involved with this opportunity!","You might be getting mixed signals from someone at work or in your daily life, but instead of wracking your brain to decipher their meaning, concentrate on something you actually enjoy. Learning fresh information about a fascinating subject will be lots more fun than jumping through hoops, and your refusal to get sucked into anyone else's drama may win admiration from like-minded people. You could even have more in common with someone who appreciates your methods, so consider reaching out.","Just because an expert advises you to take a certain path doesn't mean you need to take it. When it comes to making an important decision, consult your conscience -- if your heart tells you to take a road less traveled, you might want to listen! Although this direction may be quite unfamiliar to you, have faith in yourself. Even if you aren't usually one to blaze a trail, there could be amazing rewards in store at the end of this journey.","You could be tired of people telling you to share what you've earned, because you feel like you've worked hard and deserve the fruits of your labor -- and you're probably right! Go ahead and treat yourself to something special today. When you acknowledge your own worth, you're more likely to attract others who recognize and celebrate your power as well. Life tends to be much more fun when you're not defending your right to follow your bliss.","Unrealistic expectations of your best friend or a partner could lead to disappointment today. There's no need to feel frustrated about any letdowns -- instead, try to adjust your expectations. A balanced attitude may lead to healthier relationships across the board. Practicing unconditional acceptance can improve your home life as well as your time with friends. Everyone's able to work together and make up for each other's shortcomings when you all agree to give one another a break and help out wherever you can!","You might not be sure exactly what kind of work you'd like to do, but you don't have to pressure yourself to figure that out right now. The answer may come after you relax and abandon yourself to fun. Pouring your energy into a creative project could be enlightening right now. Even if your future job isn't directly related to this endeavor, the happiness that it brings might inspire you to branch out in a new direction. Cultivating contentment can bring the answers you seek.","It may feel like everyone wants something from you in an exhausting way. Meeting all these needs could be impossible, and today, it's OK not to try! Sticking close to home and grounding yourself in familiar surroundings might be a better idea right now. Making some comfort food or decorating a drab room could lift your mood. Soon, you'll probably find yourself humming instead of brooding. An improved outlook can inspire you in a lot of ways -- whatever happens, don't let outside pressures get you down.","The realm of deep emotion may make you uncomfortable, Sagittarius, as you probably prefer to find your adventures in other areas of life. Unfortunately, a difficult family situation might force you to confront confusing feelings today. On one hand, you may feel compassion for a relative in trouble, but you also might be tired of bailing this person out of issues that could have been avoided. You aren't required to come to their rescue -- sometimes you have to prioritize your own sanity.","Imprecise thinking could result in an error today. If you make a misstep, try not to dwell on it -- just apologize to anyone who's been inconvenienced, then pick yourself up and try again! When you look at mistakes as learning opportunities, there's no reason to be embarrassed. After all, every human being is flawed, no matter how hard they try not to be. Your determined ability to recover from setbacks shows people how well-rounded and capable you really are, and might even lead to greater opportunities.","Contrary to popular belief, more money doesn't always mean more happiness. Real wealth can be found around you every day, likely in things you already own and in relationships you already have. If you find yourself worrying about your bank balance, make an inventory of things that make you feel fulfilled. These items can include anything, from physical objects like possessions and pets to less tangible ones like talents and friends. This exercise can help you realize how rich you already are.","Focusing on fairy-tale ideals could block your way to healthy and realistic familial relationships right now. It's possible your fantasy about what a family should be is irrational. Instead of aspiring to impossible perfection, try to work with what you already have. Compromising on any current issues may help you realize how lucky you are to have good people around you. When things improve at home, it might become much easier to attract prestigious opportunities in other areas of your life as well."
2021-11-22,"Happy surprises abound thanks to the sentimental Cancer Moon's sextile to spontaneous Uranus happening at 10:59 pm EST. We should be open to positive shifts in personal relationships, work arrangements, and travel opportunities. Family matters could also undergo big improvements, such as a relative adopting a more compassionate approach to an ongoing conflict. Instead of questioning any attitude changes, celebrate them. This may inspire us to be more caring and giving overall -- even to people we struggle to get along with.","A sudden windfall could allow you to make some welcome home improvements. You might want to DIY some unique modern touches to your place or splurge on cutting-edge gadgets that make you feel like you're running your household with the flip of a switch. Both options likely appeal to your pioneering taste. If you've been looking for a new place to live, you're also in luck! A beautiful property could suddenly become available. Check it out quickly because time may be of the essence.","Being willing to try anything once should serve you well today. If a friend invites you to take a class with them or try out a new skill, accept it -- you may discover a newfound talent and even learn how to create some really useful things. You might already have a knack for making and appreciating things of beauty, so learning how to make items that serve a more specific purpose could really add to your repertoire. Selling your creations may also be an option -- it's a win-win!","Pouring your heart into work that you love could have unexpected benefits. Although it may seem like nobody notices your efforts today, having patience right now may lead to many benefits in the future. Your devotion to this labor of love could get you a moneymaking offer in this or a similar field. It may never have occurred to you that making a living from such a fun activity was possible. The process might take longer than you'd prefer, but the end results could be amazing.","Reaching a lifelong goal could actually happen today as your ruling planet, the receptive Moon, is breezing through your sign and making a supportive angle to startling Uranus. A phone call, text, or email might contain delightful news! It's a good idea to check your messages often, as one could contain an opportunity requiring a fast response. Even if you would usually deliberate before changing course, a split-second pivot at this time might put you on the path to some delightful good fortune.","It may feel like you're getting lots of help from the cosmos today, especially regarding career matters. The chance to apply for a position that seemed out of your league could appear out of nowhere. Although attempting to get this job could be daunting, you can project an air of confidence -- even if there are some unfamiliar duties involved with it. Don't worry! Summon your courage and passion and you can get a foot in the door and learn the ropes in record time.","You could have a lot to learn right now from a friend who has kept some impressive knowledge a secret. Their accomplishments might be almost unbelievable -- which makes this a valuable lesson to never judge a book by its cover. If you prematurely label people, it can lead to lost opportunities. Working with your friend on a personal or professional project could help both of you learn and grow in ways you've never dreamed of.","You could really benefit from others' resources right now, and find yourself seeing the hidden value in people and organizations. If you propose a radical new business strategy, you may be handsomely rewarded. Take this bounty in stride because it might be just the beginning of a series of professional victories. While it may take a long time for someone as kind as you to rise to the top, the satisfaction of getting there without stepping on anyone else will be worth it.","People may have a way of astonishing you today, and someone you thought you knew could reveal surprising -- and very helpful -- dimensions. Be open to following their lead, even if you're normally the one in the driver's seat. This is a great chance to learn something new! Adding fresh tools to your kit could allow you to work smarter in the future, instead of harder. Learning such a useful lesson will definitely be worth keeping your ego in check.","Sharing is always caring, even if you don't see rewards for it right away or at all. Today, however, you may be blessed and humbled to realize just how many people appreciate all the kindness you've extended to them over the years. A generous token of appreciation could be coming your way from someone you helped out recently or long ago. Instead of being surprised, acknowledge how much you deserve this thanks -- even if it's long overdue!","Something might be weighing on your mind at the moment and it's important you find a way to comfort yourself. Whether it's reaching out to a friend who never fails to make you laugh or taking a few hours to yourself to do something you love, listen to your heart and you'll feel better soon. Even if you have to take some time away from work or other responsibilities, taking care of your own mental health should be a priority.","Domestic delights may be beckoning today and a sudden development at home or within your family could bring you a lot of joy. A pregnancy announcement, real estate opportunity, or surprise reunion may be in store, and upon hearing this news, you might have to sit down to recover from the shock! Even if you're usually able to keep your cool in unexpected situations, this one could make you tremble with excitement. It's time to celebrate!","Your creative talent can help you connect with someone right now who's interested in marketing your work. You could find great joy out of making beautiful things while someone else handles the more administrative affairs. On the other hand, if you've ever thought about teaching, this can be a great time to start looking into it. Even if you lack official training, there are many unconventional classes you could lead that would allow you to use and share your unique abilities."
2021-11-23,"We shouldn't let a desire for nurturing and affection override our common sense, particularly when the wistful Cancer Moon opposes needy Venus at 5:49 am EST. It helps to remember that chasing rainbows can make them more elusive. The best way to get what we want is to imagine having it -- working to make our dreams come true is easier when we believe in them! The Moon's later trines to determined Mars and intuitive Neptune can help us manifest our wishes.","Patience is always a virtue, but it might be particularly beneficial right now. By getting in line behind everyone else, you could earn the respect of an important authority figure. Working together and delegating tasks may teach you valuable lessons about conserving your strength. In the past, you might have been quick to jump into projects with all your energy, but with the help of your peers, you can discover when to hold back so you'll be as strong as possible at a critical moment.","Not being able to do the things or travel to the places you want can be distressing. Rather than dwelling on your limitations, however, give thanks for what you already have. By filling your mind with the positive feelings that a relationship, hobby, or job brings you, fulfillment may arrive in new forms. Plus, you never know when a friend with good connections might help you get something or go somewhere you really wanted. This is one of those days when who you know could move mountains.","A current alliance or collaboration may be draining, especially if you're having to pick up the other person's slack and do both your jobs at once! Unless they're willing to accept more responsibility, it may be time to go solo. Once you get rid of any dead weight, you can rise to the top with greater ease. It may even be possible to pursue a job in a new field that makes you feel more successful and fulfilled.","Joining forces with someone just because you're lonely is a bad idea -- this is a good time to be your own best friend. If you have questions about what to do today, turn your attention inward and let your finely-tuned intuition sense the best path to follow. Every time you trust your inner guidance, you're honing its sensitivity and becoming stronger. This can pave the way to a personal or professional relationship that's worthy of your considerable gifts.","Overindulging can get you into trouble! It's best to practice moderation when it comes to food and drink right now, and you might want to steer clear of peers who are indifferent to their health. You'll need to be energized to deal with any challenges, and it seems some domestic disturbances may be in store. Standing up to a demanding family member could transform your relationship -- it's one thing to respect your elders but it's another to enable their bad behavior. Rely on your bravery because it's one of your greatest assets.","Too much partying might put you in a bind today! Even if you've earned the right to a break, there is likely still work to be done. When it comes to celebrating, try to find a good stopping point so you can shift your attention back to your obligations -- a group endeavor or team project might especially struggle without your input. Don't be afraid to be direct with anyone who hasn't been pulling their weight. It's not your responsibility to bail them out.","Hiding from the world won't solve anything now. You might be facing a difficult career matter, and it's important you push yourself to face it. If you've had a tough time getting a job, consider updating your skills. Learn what the market expects from people who have your dream job -- the answer might astonish you! A simple class could be all that stands between you and an amazing opportunity. Holding on to a degree or certificate of accomplishment can instill you with renewed confidence.","As comfortable as your current situation may be, there might be some glaring reasons why you can't remain there. It could be time for you to venture into greener pastures, no matter how intimidating that sounds. Even if you normally welcome challenges, world events over the past couple of years may have made you wary of unfamiliar situations. Instead of letting your emotions get the better of you, build up your confidence again by taking a risk and encouraging yourself to grow past any fears.","Putting too much emphasis on material security won't help you right now. As a Sagittarius, you probably aren't someone who lets possessions weigh you down, and there's no reason to start doing so now! If you must take a pay cut for the sake of a job that gives you more free time to pursue your passions, consider doing it. When you listen to your heart, every facet of your life can improve. Friends should be relieved to see you happy again!","Getting wrapped up in your own self-image could cause you to miss some important signals from others. Someone you know, such as a friend, neighbor, or colleague, may be struggling with some emotional issues. Instead of dedicating all your energy to creating a great impression, simply ask if there's anything you can do to relieve their pain. Their answer may surprise you -- it's likely something you can do right now. Don't hesitate to put yourself aside and help this person however you can.","A big secret may come to light now, changing the way you view wellness and friendship. Being more compassionate to someone who you discover has been struggling with a health condition may improve your approach toward all your relationships. You might be such an independent person that you have trouble imagining how limiting health issues can be. Finding a way to help this person with their work could make a major difference in their plight and create a real sense of support and community.","You might be tired of explaining your interests to friends who don't understand them. Even if you enjoy these people for certain reasons, it may be time to distance yourself from them if they are unable to support you. Joining a group of individuals who enjoy your favorite subjects can bring you the sense of belonging you've been missing out on. These kindred spirits may also be able to help you make progress toward other dreams, so don't be afraid to show how unique and gifted you really are!"
2021-11-24,"Emotions may feel intense today, making it difficult to control ourselves. A rigid opposition between the moody Moon and imposing Pluto warns against tense standoffs -- it's best to avoid power struggles altogether. Once curious Mercury enters adventurous Sagittarius at 10:36 am EST, we're more inclined to follow our head over our heart. Intellectual pursuits like reading, teaching, or learning can be liberating. Later this morning, Luna moves into playful Leo and makes a supportive angle to Mercury, urging us to put fun on the front burner.","There's more to life than reaching the top of the professional ladder. Cultivating a happy home can bring a welcome balance today, so start putting some time into creating domestic bliss. If you're just too innovative to adopt a traditional decorating scheme, pass up on the matching furniture and understated artwork and let your personal style shine with a delightful blend of colors, textures, and styles. An environment that reflects your dynamism and pioneering spirit can help to energize your whole life!","You may yearn to explore new experiences or a new way of life, but feel that it isn't possible right now. Travel or financial restrictions could be keeping you close to home. Resist the temptation to dwell on your disappointment and, instead, make it your mission to bloom where you're planted. This may mean dramatically changing your routine, perhaps by setting tedious tasks aside to make more time for fun activities. Your luck could absolutely change as your heart lifts, so do your best to cultivate happiness.","Interpersonal ties are everything now that talkative Mercury, your ruling planet, is moving into your 7th House of Relationships. It's a good thing Geminis tend to welcome collaboration because two heads are probably better than one in virtually every area of life now! Working alongside someone who has bold visions and an optimistic attitude might be very beneficial to you. Even if you're quite different from this person, whatever you do together could turn out amazing.","You might have the sense that someone has it out for you as the sensitive Moon, your ruling planet, forms a hard angle to power-hungry Pluto in your 7th House of Others. While your suspicions may be correct, how much this person affects you is still up to you. Rather than getting drawn into any dramatic confrontations, put your energy into making your own talents shine. Even if they try to sabotage you somehow, your smart ideas and loyal work should bring you all of the abundance you deserve.","Your charm, wit, and enthusiasm could open new doors for you now. This is a great time to put your creativity and glowing personality on display! Your ability to express yourself in an upbeat way can draw a lot of people into your life, and you never know where these connections will lead. If you're the artistic type, showing off some of your work could draw a lot of interest right now. No matter what's on your agenda for today, let your inner child lead the way.","Life at home might feel quite busy today as quick-moving Mercury enters your 4th House of Family and Domestic Matters. Communication may be buzzing, but there could be tension if family members' different plans and schedules start conflicting. Thankfully, an analytical Virgo like you will probably enjoy solving this puzzle. It could help to look at the bigger picture of what's happening at home, rather than all the little details. By the end of the day, a quiet night in and a little alone time might feel like a reward.","Libras tend to be quite amicable, but anger or resentment may be stirring right now as a result of an ongoing situation that you feel is unfair. Rather than letting your frustration get the best of you, let it inspire you to move on to something better. Regardless of the type of change you make, the sheer act of leaving behind a toxic situation will probably bring you great relief. Even if extra work is required as you adjust, the opportunity to feel positive again will be well worth it.","Keeping your eyes on the prize might not be easy as the sullen Moon opposes your dark ruling planet, Pluto. It can be challenging to imagine a golden future when your surroundings seem grim. At times like these, it pays to dive into your powerful imagination. Let your intuition lead you to the path with the best chance of success and don't look back! The more confident you are in yourself, the faster obstacles tend to vanish before you.","You may be brimming with brilliant ideas, eager to share them with anyone who will listen! Communicative Mercury enters your upbeat sign today and, fortunately, people should be receptive to what you have to say thanks to your enthusiasm and possibly your impressive track record. Some visionaries are all talk, but not you! If you hope these ideas will be financially rewarding, don't worry if this type of success doesn't come immediately. You can attract tons of future prosperity if you stay focused and keep working hard.","Issues of power and control may have been plaguing you for a while, and today is probably no exception. You might be tired of defending your actions to people who put down your efforts to build something of lasting value. To them, your vision could seem wildly unrealistic while to you, success feels like it's virtually guaranteed. This may be a good time to work toward your goals on your own rather than discussing plans with people who keep trying to hold you back.","Start your day in a healthy way because you'll probably need extra energy to deal with a large group of people today. Whether this is a family, friendly, or professional setting, once you're there, do what you can to stay alert and focused, as a passing remark can lead to a productive conversation. You could connect with someone with similar ideas as you, and you might really get each other going with your inspiring visions. This may even be the beginning of a very successful collaboration!","Career matters may improve starting today as communicative Mercury moves into your 10th House of Profession and Reputation. You can make a wonderful impression on everyone you meet thanks to your upbeat attitude, so whether you're working today or not, think of every interaction as an opportunity to open a new door. Former colleagues may also be happy to provide references for you, so you might want to start reaching out and reconnecting. Who you know can make a real difference."
2021-11-25,"It might be difficult not to take unintentional slights personally today due to the hypersensitive Moon's opposition to stern Saturn at 3:52 am EST. Instead of flaring up at perceived insults, it's best to step back and breathe deep. The last thing we should do at such a complex time is burn bridges that we'll need to cross later. Still, it may be difficult to practice restraint, particularly when Luna squares irritable Uranus and aggressive Mars later in the day. Coping strategies will be critical to success.","Even if you want to fight for what's yours, don't forget your obligations to your nearest and dearest. Their love and support have probably helped you attain things you wouldn't have been able to otherwise, and now it may be time to show your appreciation for all the sacrifices they've made. This might mean helping a loved one financially or providing practical support to a struggling friend. What seems like a drain on your resources right now could actually lead to an increase, as your generosity may be returned threefold.","Indecisiveness on your part could be wreaking havoc in your personal life. You may be struggling to choose a path, which is making you and others anxious. Deep down inside, you probably know what you truly want -- the real problem is more likely that your desires are in contrast to those of the people you love. It's only natural that you're distressed because you want everyone to be happy. However, compromising your vision to placate others is a recipe for misery, so be true to yourself!","It may feel like you've fallen short of your ideals recently, which could be disappointing. Give yourself a break, though, and congratulate yourself on how far you have come! You might have been working with limited resources and unhelpful people, and making any progress at all in such a tough environment is admirable. Today, allow yourself some time to take stock of your journey. Go over the steps you've already made to turn your dreams into reality and ask yourself what you need to do next.","Money may be tight now, just when you feel like you need it most. Resist the temptation to ask someone for a loan, as that could make a tense situation even more strained. Try to recall the last time you were in a tight spot -- the secret to your past success has likely been following your heart. You feel things deeply for a reason, Cancer, so let your emotions guide you forward. When you go in a direction that makes you happy, abundance often follows!","You could find yourself yearning for things you don't have while the needy Moon moves through your sign today. However, this sense of lack could be holding you back even more, so try to fill any emotional voids with gratitude instead of letting them swallow you. When you give thanks for whatever prosperity you currently have, your blessings tend to expand. Even if others don't understand this approach, a positive and abundant mindset gives you the power to make things happen!","The pressure of a routine could be getting to you at the moment. While you may pride yourself on staying committed and doing quality work even in trying circumstances, don't let this force you to remain in a bad situation. If you're constantly giving your energy to people who don't appreciate your efforts, move on. There's no need to publicize your decision -- simply continue quietly until you find somewhere that's worthy of you. People in the new environment will probably recognize just how valuable your contributions are!","Depriving yourself of pleasure is a losing proposition, and making yourself a martyr to hard work likely won't impress anyone. In fact, it may only cause the people around you to take advantage of you! Allow yourself a well-deserved break, even if you think there's too much going on. Everyone will just have to learn to manage without you -- they might even begin to understand how hard you work to help them, which could cause them to treat you with more appreciation as a result.","Acts of hostility on your part could cause resentment from others, so it might be time for an attitude adjustment! The temperamental Moon is squaring aggressive Mars in your 1st House of Identity today, making it imperative that you treat others how you want to be treated. This could be especially true in close partnerships, as a person who is close to your heart may no longer be willing to deal with any angry outbursts. Try absorbing and mirroring their laidback ways -- their steadfast calm could greatly benefit you.","The more negative feedback you give yourself, the harder it can be to make any kind of progress. Devote today to self-love! That means only giving yourself praise, encouragement, and high marks. At first, this practice may seem deluded, but don't stop trying. What you think, you become, so the more positive remarks you feed your brain, the more confident and capable you can ultimately feel. Once you make up your mind that a skill isn't that difficult to master, you could make great strides in learning it.","Working hard today may be like spinning your tires in the sand -- it's a waste of energy! Rather than doubling your efforts to get ahead, cut them in half. As the instinctive Moon opposes your responsible ruling planet, Saturn, it may be better to wait than to act. Simply sitting back and listening to others could trigger a breakthrough you didn't expect. Sometimes an idle state is a good thing because it leaves you open to moments of discovery.","You might feel like you've hit a wall right now, both physically and emotionally. Although you may be tempted to push through your exhaustion, don't make this mistake! Your body is trying to tell you that it needs rest, and it's your job to honor its signals. If you can't take the day off work entirely, then at least take it easy and go to bed early. Extra rest can also help put you in a better mindset to deal with any interpersonal challenges you might be facing.","Facing your demons may be critical to your growth at this time. Although you shouldn't dwell on bad memories, sitting with them long enough to make peace with them is good for your emotional and mental health. Being a people-pleaser might have helped you get around difficult people and rules in the past, but now you've developed the resources and awareness you need to forge a path of your own. Instead of asking for other people's approval, follow your bliss and make no apologies for it."
2021-11-26,"Going overboard is easy as the dramatic Leo Moon opposes excessive Jupiter today. When things go wrong, we need to stay calm or we might just be pouring salt in our wounds. Whether we're dealing with delayed services, canceled plans, or broken promises, it helps to train our gaze firmly on the horizon. How we deal with challenges in the present moment could dictate how the future unfolds. Luckily, when the Moon enters grounded Virgo at 9:12 pm EST, we'll be empowered to take a more logical and even-keeled approach.","Obligations to others could undermine your personal enjoyment today. You might often add extra tasks to your daily list, knowing your boundless energy will help you burn through them in record time. Unfortunately, this impulse can eventually lead to burnout. Try to make mindful choices about your schedule right now, and don't feel pressured to help someone out if you'd rather get some exercise or work on a creative project. You deserve to feel good, too, so fill your day with fun, even if it means politely turning down others' requests.","Your family may be demanding your time and attention right now, even if you have lots of other things to do. If drama ensues, take a deep breath and let your loved ones resolve problems by themselves. When you show faith in their abilities to handle conflict, they could become more self-reliant. This will be beneficial for everyone -- including you. Taking time to focus on your own obligations will make you feel more satisfied and accomplished than giving all your time to others' emotional affairs.","While there's a jittery vibe to the day, you'd be wise to listen more and talk less -- though this could be challenging for a chatterbox like you! If you get nervous, you might feel an urge to talk unnecessarily to fill any awkward silences, but don't make this mistake today or else you could miss out on some valuable information. An experienced and knowledgeable person might be eager to discuss things with you and one of their chance remarks could really benefit you, so be ready to receive.","Although you might find yourself feeling sad, lonely, or lost right now, resist the temptation to reach for your wallet because retail therapy is unlikely to fill any emotional gaps. The solution to your problem is likely more spiritual than material. Instead of spending money, spend your time -- partaking in one of your favorite activities or getting together with someone you love could lift your mood in minutes. The sense of lack that has been dogging you could disappear altogether before you know it.","It's easy to feel self-conscious sometimes when the spotlight shines directly on you, even for a confident Leo like yourself. You may have had a lot of responsibility laid on you lately, and some small tasks might be falling through the cracks. If these matters are brought to your attention, try not to become defensive, just breathe deep and count to ten. Centering yourself can help you see the big picture again, and at that point, you can either ask for support or move on knowing you're doing your best.","You may feel a bit unsettled right now. Although you tend to live in a logical world, Virgo, you'd be wise to lean on your intuition. If you feel a twinge in your stomach, pay attention to it. Your instincts could be telling you that something is too good to be true, so try to gather more information before making any commitments or getting in too deep. Once you learn more, you could very well decide that whatever is being offered just isn't right for you.","Today you could feel like friends are judging you -- like every decision you make is being met with skeptical glances or remarks. Sometimes, though, getting others' approval is overrated, especially when it comes to things you personally enjoy. Although everyone may not share your interests, they also shouldn't expect you to deny yourself the things you love. Agree to go your separate ways and meet up with your buddies later. By that time, you may feel so refreshed that any defensive energy just vanishes.","Your professional life could be clashing with your personal life at the moment. Be ready to establish some healthy boundaries with bosses, coworkers, or clients who ask too much of you. You may be so resourceful that people often pile responsibilities onto you, knowing you'll handle them well, but this isn't fair to you! By defending your right to downtime, your life can become much more enjoyable and balanced. A friend who understands your dilemma might congratulate you for making such a courageous change -- let this build your confidence.","It might feel like your expertise is being challenged today. Rather than getting defensive if you don't know an answer, respond openly and honestly and people will likely be grateful for your transparency. Assure them that you'll follow up with the information they are asking for, and then make it a point to do so. Once you put everybody's minds at ease, it will probably be much easier to sail forward on any project with a more solid plan.","You might be tempted to spread yourself thin right now, but being all things to all people just isn't possible. It would be better to set your sights on one or two goals that fill you with excitement. If that means canceling appointments and backing out of other projects, so be it. Paring down your focus to things that really matter could allow greater abundance to flow into your life. Blessings can multiply more easily when you aren't being pulled in a million different directions.","A close relationship may feel like a weight around your neck today, even if you normally enjoy spending time with this person. You simply might prefer to attend to your own obligations and interests right now, and there's nothing wrong with that! The key is to express your need for solitude in a calm and respectful way. Lashing out when you're tired, hungry, or upset that your needs aren't getting met will only make things more difficult. Your approach makes all the difference.","You might feel worn out by what's happening in your life right now -- like your private time is constantly interrupted by others barging in and making all sorts of demands. Feel free to send all calls to voicemail and put a metaphorical or literal ""do not disturb"" sign on your door. You need time to think, process, and reflect so you can get your energy and your mood back to center. If you have necessary errands that need to be taken care of, a close friend might be happy to step in."
2021-11-27,"Manifesting what we want might be easier than we think today, even as the fussy Moon in Virgo makes a square to flighty Mercury at 5:27 am EST. Obsessing over what is going wrong can drive away our desires, yet immersing ourselves in pleasures as simple as a delicious cup of coffee or sunlight moving through the trees could inspire us to make our dreams materialize. Once the Moon blissfully trines unpredictable Uranus this evening, our decision to feel good could deliver a delightful surprise.","Stubborn attitudes can get you in trouble at this time. The more flexible you are, the easier it will be to improve your finances as the Moon makes a beneficial trine to Uranus in your money sector. Even if you're an expert in your field, that doesn't mean you have nothing left to learn. Be open to working with someone who has a different perspective than you, even if they're new to the game. Their fresh ideas and modern methods could really polish up your knowledge base.","The prospect of getting revenge against a rival may be tempting right now. As the emotive Moon slams into a tough angle with petty Mercury in your 8th House of Passion, just thinking about someone who caused issues in your life could fill you with anger and resentment. It's totally understandable that you want to lash out at a person if they purposely hurt you, but rising above your fury will have more long-term benefits. Try to channel your powerful emotions into a personal project instead.","Misunderstandings abound due to the tense energy swirling around today, and it could be easy to take offense at a perfectly innocent remark. Make an effort to wait before responding to a comment that hurts your feelings. Being analytical or logical about emotions might really help you maintain necessary tactful silences throughout the day. In the evening, your patience may be rewarded with an opportunity at home to blow off any steam that built up during the day.","You may be drawn to dwell on your fears right now, but pleasant distractions can prove therapeutic. The last thing you want is to let anxiety compromise your health! Listening to relaxing music, meditating on something calming, or practicing deep breathing exercises helps keep dark thoughts at bay. When in doubt, remind yourself of everything that's already worked out for you. Positive expectations can pave the way to success -- and maybe even to some delightful spur-of-the-moment fun with a friend.","Fearful energy could make it difficult for you to take a risk today, even if you usually enjoy rolling the metaphorical dice, Leo. The prospect of losing what you have may be a bit unnerving, and it's OK to postpone any bold moves for another day when your natural courage returns. In fact, being cautious could pay off unexpectedly in the financial or professional arena, so it might turn out to be a good thing if you aren't blazing forward right now.","Conflicting energy at home could disrupt your groove, and it may be particularly difficult to meet an aggressive family member in the middle today. No matter how gracefully you try to avoid a sensitive topic, they might continue to harp on it! Keeping your distance may be the only way to avoid an argument -- but luckily, not everybody disagrees with your ideas. Someone whose opinion you respect could want to form an alliance with you, affirming you in a really valuable way.","Talking nonstop may be quite easy at the moment, but to make a good impression, try to practice discretion. Even if it feels counterintuitive, you'll probably be glad you held back when communicating with someone who's a tad judgmental. The less ammunition you give, the more difficult it will be for any naysayers to defame your character. Afterward, reward yourself for looking out for number-one by allowing yourself some luxury. A new accessory or a special treat could be just what you deserve!","Stressful energy surrounding money could be keeping you awake at night. If you want to cultivate a calmer emotional state, make an effort to focus on the prosperity you have in your life. Keep your mind on things that make you feel happy, including anything from food on the table to comfy pillows to loyal friends. It may even help to talk to or adopt the attitude of a friend who seems to have it all. Their confident mindset can help inspire your own faith in abundance!","Feelings may be running high because of the emotional Moon's tension with mental Mercury in your sign today. You may not approve of a higher-up's destabilizing outbursts, but while it's true this behavior can be upsetting, it can also lend insight to this leader's character. Knowing what motivates and angers them could actually improve your career prospects. If you've been thinking of asking for a raise or promotion, you would be wise to use whatever you learn today to your advantage.","While you might be feeling especially nostalgic today, fixating on the past won't solve anything. It's fine to look back fondly on old relationships, childhood memories, and bygone eras, but you should limit this reminiscing in favor of an opportunity to expand your future horizons. While the Moon forms a beneficial trine to progressive Uranus in your 9th House of Expansion, making a list of things in your life that you appreciate can cause those blessings to grow and multiply.","Today's tense energy could inhibit your plans, even if you usually enjoy whatever it is you're doing. The prospect of public speaking, in particular, might fill you with dread. If you must make a presentation, try to find ways to relax yourself beforehand, like breathing exercises or visualizations. Projecting an air of calm will likely make your audience receptive to whatever you say. Once you clear this hurdle, you'll be free to enjoy some domestic pleasures -- consider inviting friends over to share in your success.","Your desire to get ahead may be undermining an important relationship. While wanting to reach the top of the career ladder is admirable, be sure to keep your dream in perspective. The most successful professionals have happy personal lives. Keep this in mind when your friends or loved ones invite you out for dinner or drinks -- a festive night on the town may be just what you need to raise your spirits and inspire you to work both smarter and harder. Have some fun today!"
2021-11-28,"Keeping our eyes on the prize is a great strategy while the productive Virgo Moon forms supportive angles to rosy Venus, energetic Mars, and resourceful Pluto. Now is the time to tackle any dreaded items on our to-do lists! Luna also opposes illusory Neptune, tempting us to linger in daydreams, but resisting this call can allow us to enjoy a well-deserved break by the end of the day. At 11:39 pm EST, the creative Sun conjuncts brilliant Mercury in Sagittarius, laying the groundwork for inspiration.","Distractions could keep you from being as productive as you'd like right now. No matter how motivated you are, you can still fall victim to your musings. It might help to set deadlines for each task and take breaks with set time limits between them. By the day's end, you may have accomplished far more than you expected! No matter what you finish, make sure to give yourself a reward for persevering. Acknowledging your own achievements paves the way to future success.","The support you want may not be forthcoming today, but don't let that stand in the way of pursuing a cherished dream! Someone with your emotional power should devote time each day to your favorite forms of expression, no matter how heavy your workload is. Even a few minutes spent being creative hones your inner artist's enthusiasm and skill. The more often you intentionally set aside time, the easier it will be to find time in the future as it becomes a habit.","Lofty ambitions could throw you off track right now. Rather than reaching for a goal that seems impossibly out of reach, break down your vision into small, achievable tasks. This may make it easier to stay focused! If you do get discouraged, try repeating some positive affirmations. It might feel silly at first, but it could also net you rich rewards. Meanwhile, the uplifting Sun's union with your ruling planet, Mercury, in your relationship-oriented 7th house can help you reach terrific breakthroughs in a stalled partnership.","Although you might lack the necessary knowledge to get ahead at the moment, instead of throwing in the towel, do whatever you can to improve your skillset. Studying with an expert may be intimidating, however, the high standards and technical knowledge they supply will be instructive. Trying to impress a new mentor of any kind will probably require a lot of tenacity, yet even if the process is difficult, it's still better than turning your back on your potential!","Today could bring about an unexpected loss. If a source of income disappears, don't panic, just start channeling your emotional energy into manifesting another opportunity. It's a matter of discipline and hard work, so don't be afraid to dig in and send out job applications, look for interviews, and network with others in your field. While the vibrant Sun, your ruling planet, unites with communicative Mercury in upbeat Sagittarius, a new job prospect may feel like a chance to get paid for having fun.","You may find yourself filled with a lot of hope today, so milk this cheerful attitude for all it's worth -- a positive mindset is often the gateway to opportunity. Even if someone close to you doesn't share your upbeat attitude, don't let any of their gloomy predictions make you miss a chance to advance your interests. While the optimistic Sun conjuncts your ruling planet, Mercury, in your 4th House of Emotions, you might have a real knack for replacing negative assumptions with glowing expectations.","While you might be looking forward to a busy day or even a list of projects and errands, the people around you may not have the level of energy or ambition that you do and you could feel like they're being sticks in the mud. Try not to worry about what anyone else does -- simply focus on your own efforts! You'll feel accomplished and rewarded by a job well done, and others may actually see your diligence as a positive example.","Trying to maintain your focus and do a good job could be difficult today as a friend may be acting up and causing you irritation. Giving them a lecture or advice might just make them more determined to cause problems and distract you even further. Remember that the only person's behavior you can really control is your own. Continue to make your own goals your priority -- when you give this person less attention, you may be surprised by how quickly their bad behavior disappears.","Right now it's critical to remember that feelings are not facts, regardless of how important they may seem. If you're feeling blue, make an effort to deliberately immerse yourself in happy thoughts -- listen to cheerful music, watch uplifting movies, and talk to joyous people. Every positive choice you make can help even the most stubborn mood melt into comfortable contentment. Once the determined Sun and mental Mercury join forces in your optimistic sign this evening, radiating positive energy should be easier than ever.","It might be quite difficult for you to focus today. It's probably rare for you to neglect your responsibilities, but today you could prefer to build castles in the air rather than tackle real-life circumstances. Even an ambitious sign like you needs an occasional break, so cut yourself some slack and don't feel bad about it! Pouring your energy into learning something new or enjoying a creative pursuit will be a welcome and well-deserved diversion from duty.","Your financial foundation might feel shaky right now due to a lack of lucrative opportunities. While it may be stressful figuring out how to make ends meet, you could also have the rare gifts of time and energy on your hands. Using your free time to enrich your personal life could bring you some peace while you seek solutions to your income. Gathering with friends, reading books, and communing with nature can help you feel a sense of abundance that overpowers what you might currently lack.","It can sometimes be difficult for a multi-faceted sign like yours to know which star to follow. Rather than looking outside of yourself for inspiration, turn your attention inward now. While it may take some patience and intentional moments of silence, your heart can ultimately nudge you toward an activity, opportunity, or relationship that feels just right. You're blessed with a powerful intuition, and when you follow its guidance with faith, you're likely to end up somewhere successful and satisfying."
2021-11-29,"This is a wonderful day to make heartfelt choices, even if they fly in the face of conventional wisdom. Being true to ourselves is especially important as the receptive Moon moves into clear-headed Libra and makes benevolent aspects to discerning Mercury and uncompromising Saturn. At 9:10 am EST, confident Mars forms a trine to idealistic Neptune, making it even easier to listen to our hearts. Under today's skies, going along with others' desires will seem less important than following our own.","Powerful emotions could lead to some profound spiritual breakthroughs today. Action-oriented Mars, your ruling planet, makes a supportive angle to mystical Neptune in your 12th House of Introspection, and supporting a system that goes against your principles may no longer be an option. Summon the courage of your convictions to strike out on your own -- you might feel immediately better knowing you're standing up for what you believe in. The people who know you well will probably notice your change in many positive ways!","Today's lively energy could give rise to some healthy debates. You may not mind a clash of opinions, as long as everyone expresses themselves respectfully. A passionate discussion that highlights your convictions could prompt you to get involved with a social movement or charitable organization. Someone you meet through this association might even inspire you to further develop your viewpoints and talents. Doors are opening for you everywhere -- be ready because at least one great opportunity is on the horizon for you.","Your intuition may be quite powerful now, particularly regarding your career. If you're longing to change jobs, this is a great time to send out applications, go on interviews, or apply for business loans. Finding work that's meaningful for you can make your heart soar. Someone with your sharp intellect could thrive in a position that requires you to develop innovative solutions to problems, while dull routines and restrictive rules might dull your natural vivacity. Considering the amount of time you spend working, it's worth the effort to find something you enjoy!","Your powerful domestic instincts could be heightened even further today. The homebody Moon, your ruling planet, makes helpful angles to thoughtful Mercury and industrious Saturn, inspiring you to tidy up your living space or stock the fridge. When your surroundings are plentiful and comfortable, you could start to see possibilities to bring abundance to other areas of your life as well. If you're inspired to try a new activity or plan a getaway after a few hours of housework, consider it your reward for being so disciplined.","Financial and emotional support may be coming your way as protective Mars in your 4th House of Family trines sympathetic Neptune in your 8th House of Shared Resources. If you've been yearning to get your own place or make some costly renovations to your home, you could receive some practical assistance from a loved one. Alternatively, you may decide to pay for something needed by one of your relatives. Either way, your relationships could give you a warm, fuzzy feeling today that's very reassuring.","Two heads are better than one right now. Working with your best friend or business associate can help cut your work in half, although you might hear some incisive criticism from them regarding your methods. Don't let these remarks cut too deep. Instead, use them as a catalyst to enhance your own performance in the future. A perfectionist Virgo like you is likely always looking for chances to improve, and in the end, you may be thankful for their feedback.","Improving your financial status could be the driving force in your life now, whether you're saving for something big or simply have a taste for the finer things in life. Fortunately, motivated Mars is moving through your 2nd House of Earned Income and forming a benevolent trine to pleasant Neptune in your 6th House of Daily Duty. Your tasks, whether professional or personal, may feel more like play at the moment, helping you whistle while you work your way to financial success.","You may be feeling an urge to step out of the shadows and into the light. Brave Mars is in your sign and forming a beneficial angle to idealistic Neptune in your expression sector, encouraging and inspiring you to speak your truth. Creative pursuits should be especially rewarding -- it doesn't even matter what specific hobby you want to pursue! Any activity that involves an element of ingenuity should cultivate joy. If you can, postpone any mundane tasks and put joy at the top of your list.","You may prefer keeping a lower profile than usual at the moment. Even if your presence is in demand, devoting yourself to domestic pleasures might feel more fulfilling than going out. Give yourself permission to have some delicious food delivered and enjoy a movie marathon! Spending time on your own could loosen your mind and inspire a wonderful new plan or fresh idea -- you might even devise a very useful way to make more money. Pondering and developing this concept could give you something exciting to look forward to.","Brilliant ideas could be coming to you fast and furious, so now is not the time to keep your thoughts under wraps! By making pitches and proposals, you can establish yourself as a great innovator. If people seem impassive to your suggestions at first, they may just be so blown away by your innovative approach that they need time to process what you present. In time, a group could come together and offer their unconditional support -- teamwork really can make the dream work.","You're being beckoned by the stars to fulfill your career ambitions. While action-oriented Mars is in your professional sector and connecting positively with visionary Neptune in your money sector, it's a great time to pursue your dream job!

Stay true to your goal and be willing to put in the effort to make it your new reality.","Many lovely opportunities may be yours for the taking right now. While enterprising Mars is in your 9th House of Learning and Expanding and beaming support to whimsical Neptune in your sign, someone who admires your receptivity could offer to teach, coach, or mentor you.

2021-11-30,"Business and pleasure blend nicely today thanks to some cosmic cooperation. Mindful Mercury sextiles pragmatic Saturn, making it easy to formulate successful plans. Another beneficial sextile between amiable Venus and sympathetic Neptune paves the way to enjoyable personal and professional encounters. At 6:14 pm EST, the radiant Sun sends beams of support to Saturn, possibly gaining us public recognition. While the indecisive Moon does make stressful angles to Venus and imposing Pluto, her trine to jovial Jupiter helps smooth over any temporary stalemates.","The stars are beckoning you toward success! Your instincts are probably right on target regarding your career. Looking the part of a polished professional could make a great impression on a potential client or employer, making it wise to dress for the job you want, rather than the one you have. Today's expansive energy rewards broad-minded attitudes, so think about emphasizing your flexibility as well. Beware of pouring too much energy into work matters, though, as your loved ones may long to connect.","Establishing a daily routine is favored at this time -- though you may need to alter your regimen to reflect your natural rhythms. For instance, if you feel most energized before lunch, it's a good idea to schedule the most challenging tasks at the beginning of the day. Similarly, save some easier chores for the part of the day when you start to fade. Your sensible attitude toward work may be noticed by someone you admire -- they could even ask for your help getting organized.","Collaboration is the name of the game right now! As your communicative ruler, Mercury, moves through your 7th House of Partnerships and makes a supportive angle to disciplined Saturn, you could form a productive alliance.

Forming new connections may involve some travel, so you might want to pack your suitcase!","Your heart and head could be arguing now as your emotional ruling planet, the Moon, squares both vain Venus and obsessive Pluto. There's nothing wrong with having desires, provided they don't consume you. In the end, getting what you want might be as simple as building your self-esteem. When you feel worthy of the abundance, relationships, and lifestyle you want, they're more likely to flow into your life. Make an effort to appreciate what you already have and you might be shocked by how prosperous you feel!","It's time to harvest some of your brilliant ideas! The sparkling Sun, your ruling planet, sextiles accomplished Saturn today, allowing you to make practical use of any inspired thoughts. Take time out of your busy schedule to exercise your creative talent, because making things that are useful, beautiful, or both could make your heart sing. Your work might also raise your social and business profiles -- if there's anything that gets attention, it's someone who uses their talent to make people's lives a lot more pleasant.","You might be even more productive than usual due to today's brisk sextile between your logical ruling planet, Mercury, who's currently touring your domestic sector, and diligent Saturn. Tidying up your surroundings could give you extra energy to tackle any tough jobs you may have been dreading. If you've been seeking employment, you might want to think about applying for positions that allow you to work from home. Being able to work without supervision can make you especially efficient and precise.","When you work with something you love, the money tends to follow. It will still be work, of course, but as long as you trust your feelings, things should turn out well while charming Venus, your ruling planet, sextiles idealistic Neptune in your service sector. If you're already happy with your current position, think about volunteering for a charitable cause. Making the world a better place would likely be a natural extension of your caring nature. Try to share your good mood with others!","It may be best to keep your thoughts and feelings secret while the moody Moon is in your 12th House of Discretion and clashing with your intense ruling planet, Pluto. Pouring out your heart could lead to misunderstandings, as a passionate person like you can appear overwhelming to some people. It's probably wise to direct your deeper emotions into personal or professional projects instead. Expressing yourself creatively or looking for a new way to make money could be extremely beneficial for you right now.","Adventure is calling your name today thanks to the lighthearted Libra Moon's sextile to your expansive ruling planet, Jupiter. Exploring unknown territory can be as simple as taking a class, watching a YouTube video, or listening to an audiobook. Let your natural curiosity be your guide! Acquiring fresh knowledge tends to give Sagittarians a sense of satisfaction that is visible to others. Any way you slice it, your powerful intellect is destined to gain some attention.","Cultivating abundance could be easier than ever during today's supportive sextile between the energizing Sun and responsible Saturn, your ruling planet, which is in your 2nd House of Earned Income. Landing a high-paying job, getting a raise, or launching a profitable business are all among the current possibilities. However, instead of taking a prominent role, you may actually prefer working behind the scenes. It can be easier to make innovative moves when you don't have to worry about someone else immediately judging your actions.","You could be particularly popular right now as the upbeat Sun in your social sector makes a sextile to karmic Saturn in your 1st House of Identity. Don't be surprised if friends flock to you for support. When you come from a place of appreciation for your peers, you can give amazing and inspiring advice. By acknowledging the best in others, they often surpass even their own expectations! Share your gift for lifting moods and raising confidence today.","Your ability to connect with virtually anyone might be especially evident as gentle Venus in your 11th House of Networking makes a beneficial angle to your dreamy ruling planet, Neptune. Contrasts and conflicts may seem to vanish into thin air when you're on the scene!

Partners could have come and gone without explanation, or things that looked good may have turned out to be huge mistakes. The good news is that this phase is over as Neptune resumes forward motion today. Get ready to make some magic with your loved ones!","The best intentions don't always have the best results -- despite any resolutions you might have made at the beginning of the year, it's probably been pretty difficult to maintain a healthy and organized lifestyle while fanciful Neptune was retrograding through your health sector for the last five months. Happily, getting your act together should become much easier today as Neptune resumes his forward motion, so you can get up off the couch and start focusing on becoming a lean, green, efficiency machine.","Anything stifling your self-expression should finally dissolve into the mist today, as elusive Neptune leaves his five-month retrograde through your creative sector. Fantasies that seemed so real one moment may be nothing more than illusions in the next, but now the skies can clear up as Neptune moves direct once again to help you move forward as well. This is a beautiful time to wear your heart on your sleeve and express yourself! You might be very impressed with how beautiful the outcome is.","Feeling at home may not have been easy lately, as for the last five months, healing Neptune has been moving retrograde through your domestic sector.

However, you might not end up actually going very far -- in fact, you're more likely to spend the day spinning in circles within your own four walls. Powerful energies are coming to a boiling point on the home front, making it seem like there's hardly enough space for you no matter where you look. Take space for yourself as necessary, or tempers might flare.","It's a good day to watch your words, since your tongue is likely a little sharper than usual under today's careful alignment between the temperamental Moon and aggressive Mars. You don't have to keep quiet or avoid people -- if anything, you're more than welcome to reach out, as any conversations could be almost electric.

It's more like there's something occurring in your peripheral vision, just beyond where you can see it.

A few careful hours could result in you saving quite a bit of money, so the effort will be worth it!","The universe shines its spotlight directly on you today, as the evocative Moon enters your sign this morning. Even if your sign isn't exactly known for your deep feelings, now is a good time to get in touch with your emotions and make sure you aren't sweeping anything under the rug. If you've been trying to avoid any truths at home, they might pop up without warning, but don't let them scare you! Instead, face them and let them know that you've got this.","There is no reason to push yourself today -- in fact, you'll go further and find more satisfaction if you take a backseat approach to life and let the universe guide you. Let yourself see the world as a fantastical place, focusing on your daydreams rather than reality. You could come across some very valuable ideas while you're zoning out, so don't think this day will be wasted. There's a whole world right inside that beautiful brain of yours. Spend some time in it!","It's a good day to give someone else a little help! Whether you decide to volunteer a few hours helping out at a local non-profit or choose to donate some of your own gently used possessions, it shouldn't be too difficult to find a way to make others the star of the show right now. You don't need to post about any altruistic urges on social media either -- you're being encouraged by the universe to give without any expectations."
2021-12-06,"We may all be inclined to test the limits of our own power today, as energetic Mars forms a supportive sextile to alchemical Pluto and focuses on what we can achieve when we remove all obstacles. No matter how hard we work, we can still be rewarded when the gentle Moon aligns with pleasure-loving Venus at 8:21 pm EST, casting a beautiful glow over the world. Another late alignment between the Moon and Pluto could seal any outstanding deals in a very potent way!","You've got a lot of raw energy at your disposal right now, so go ahead and use it! While it's important not to run anyone over in your stampede to reach the finish line, there is a very high chance you'll take home any prize available today. Get ready to run with the best of them! Something you've been working on for a long time may finally be ready to come to fruition, and it could be waiting at the end of the race.","Things might feel a little bit nebulous at the moment. Although you may usually prefer to deal with concrete and factual things in the here and now, today you've got cosmic clearance to get in the slow lane and coast along. You don't have to do anything other than take it all in! If you want, you could spend some time on a fun creative activity. Whatever you end up doing, letting go may be wonderful for your mission in the long run.","Money is never a fixed entity, but your finances may be especially fluid today. Yes, there are simpler things you can do, such as spending or saving every penny you get. However, your money can do so much more for you. You can invest, you can donate, you can hide it under your mattress, but the important thing is to remember that you have lots of options. It can grow or deplete depending on your choices -- so be savvy when you make them!","People might have a lot to offer you at the moment! Even though you shouldn't normally weigh everyone you know by what they can do for you, right now you can do so in service of understanding just how much they truly enhance your life. The flipside of this is that you may realize there are some who truly do not enrich your life. It could be time to separate the wheat from the chaff and leave behind that which no longer serves you.","The stars are highlighting the women in your life at this time, so if there's a seasoned female figure in your life, whether she's been a role model in your past or has a current idea of where you want to go, try to reach out! Even if you're not the type who usually wants to ask for help, it's a great day to contact someone you respect for any advice. Do your best to really listen to what they have to say.","You can make leaps and bounds on the professional front today. If you've been encountering roadblocks, have faith that those could soon begin to disappear. A VIP or other superior could finally take notice of all the hard work you've been doing -- even if you haven't been chipping away at a major project, it won't be surprising if you find a moment to shine in the spotlight regardless of that. You might want to make sure you're looking your best, just in case!","Things could feel a little hectic around the house today, so if you need to find a moment to slip away, you shouldn't feel any guilt about doing so. Life is about balance and compromise, often more than we'd like. While it's important to be fair and understanding, that doesn't mean it's always easy. It's OK to bow out from any difficult conversations and just focus on yourself and your current needs. You can always get back to people tomorrow.","You've probably had a lot to say in your life, even if you don't actually voice every thought that comes to mind. While not every thought needs to be broadcasted, you can come up with some real gems when you put your mind to it. Take this day to mine your mind -- think about how far you've come and how much you've developed over time! The chance of a revelation or two waiting for you after some self-reflection is quite high.","You could receive a major windfall today if you play your cards right. This may sound like a fairy tale or simple fantasy, but something you've been waiting on for a very long time might finally be ready to shape up and pay off. You're likely going to enjoy the fruits of your labor very, very much. If you've been putting in the effort, then you have nothing to fear and everything to hope for. Go forth and manifest a miracle -- it's your time!","Being first in everything can be glamorous and exciting, but it might not be completely satisfying if, after a time, you're still all up there alone. Today your time would be best spent on the most important people in your life, reminding them of how much they mean to you. If you feel like there aren't that many special people around you, then start looking -- someone could appear on the horizon. No one was meant to go through life alone.","Opportunities may arrive when you least expect them, so if life seems a bit like a fairy tale today, don't question it. A work matter or other project you've been chugging away at for a very long time could receive a huge boost from out of the blue -- possibly from someone who's been quietly keeping track of your progress until now. The suddenness might sweep you off your feet, but try to keep up because you can go far right now!","Your sign isn't known for being very competitive or for ruffling a lot of feathers on your way to the top. Still, it wouldn't hurt to blow your own horn today and make people aware of just how capable you are! That isn't to say you should make an unnecessary fuss, but if you've been hanging out in the wings or blending in with the scenery, it might be time to finally step out on stage and put on a show."
2021-12-07,"The temperamental Moon enters Aquarius this morning, adding a spark of ingenuity to the day. We'll need that ability to think outside the box as mental Mercury moves into a confusing square with mystical Neptune at 10:16 am EST, casting a fog over the morning. Inspiring ideas can come to us, but they might not be very realistic. Don't expect too much from them! That said, a late evening conjunction between the Moon and reasonable Saturn will help ground us after a wild day.","Many messages may be coming your way today, but it might be pretty difficult to hear anything specific because of all the clamor. The universe is expending lots of energy in very fantastical parts of your chart -- possibly a little too much energy! Instead of inspiring you, it will probably just leave you feeling exhausted or confused. Live life in the slow lane for the time being, and know you'll get where you need to go when the moment is right.","Keeping to yourself might be the best option at the moment, as people may not be quite as understanding as you might hope. Perhaps you'd prefer to focus on more serious matters, or the usual jokes and banter just aren't in your current vocabulary. It's OK to have days when you feel like sticking with your own thoughts, and it's fine if that's today! You can return to socializing tomorrow when you don't feel so bogged down by whatever's happening within your mind.","The planets are going to make it incredibly difficult to choose between having fun and getting to work today -- this might be particularly difficult for you, sociable Gemini. A specific person might claim all your attention -- or at least attempt to! Still, don't forget that you have responsibilities to attend to in the real world. They won't simply go away just because you'd rather not do them. You can spend some time having fun with others, but don't overdo it.","You've probably got plenty of things on your to-do list. While it is important to check those off, it can sometimes be a little too easy to get distracted with more entertaining thoughts. This is going to be one of those days when you'd much rather daydream than put your nose to the grindstone. Fortunately, as long as you keep your unproductive activities to today only, it shouldn't be a problem. Any tasks can likely wait for twenty-four hours while you do your own thing.","It's a beautiful day to enjoy yourself, but don't be too shocked if you feel a lingering worry tugging at your mind, as though like there's something just outside the corner of your vision. Fortunately, this sensation likely isn't grounded in reality. Push it to the back burner and don't let it distract you from having the pleasant day you deserve! Any concerns should stop bubbling up soon. You can come back to them on another day when you're in the mood for such things.","You're likely deep in your emotions today, so don't be caught off guard if you feel a little more sensitive than usual. There isn't anything wrong with this in theory, except that someone might come along to push your buttons -- which could be all too easy since they could be so exposed. Take space for yourself as need be, but don't be scared to draw a line in the sand and let people know where your boundaries are. The right people will respect them.","You could have plenty of things on your plate and calling for your attention, but that doesn't mean you need to keep a close eye on each and every one of them. It's important to display a certain amount of discernment right now, because you likely can't deal with all the irons you have in the fire. Make a decision to only tend to the things that absolutely need it, and leave the superfluous or unimportant ones for another day.","The planets are homing in on your work and finances today, encouraging you to put your best foot forward. Their enthusiasm is great, but that doesn't mean you'll be able to focus. Mystical Neptune is acting up in your 5th House of Fun, reminding you of all the possibilities waiting in the great wide yonder. It's no secret that daydreams are much more appealing than tending to any fiscal responsibilities -- but it's up to you whether you give in or buckle down to work.","It's going to be hard to speak logically today, because almost everything you think or say will probably be tinged with a heavy dose of feelings. No matter how emotional you normally are, dreamy Neptune in your sensitive 4th House clashes with boisterous Mercury. You may be impacted more than other signs, so if you feel on the verge of waterworks, it isn't your imagination. Take today to focus on your emotional needs -- you should be back to yourself in no time.","There might be a wrench or two thrown in the works for you right now. You may be generally better than most at keeping on top of your obligations and making sure that you're checking off every necessary box, but even you can have things slip through the cracks on occasion. If you feel frazzled, try to make a list of everything you need to do so that nothing gets forgotten. Don't leave any gaps where you could get tripped up!","The world is full of possibilities, and you may have lots of people asking you to come out and play! It's always fun to link up with friends for a day of doing whatever you please, but that doesn't mean you can just ignore your responsibilities -- especially fiscal ones. There's a confusing energy in your financial sector casting a shadow over the day, so make sure a generous urge to foot the bill doesn't end up emptying your own account.","It's a terrific day for making major progress on the professional front -- that is, until you might start to lose steam and putter out. What inspires you one moment could wear you out the next, so don't push too hard or fast. Taking your time is probably the best method available to you, because doing slapdash work may result in you missing or glazing over something very important. Try and stay focused, even if only for a few hours!"
2021-12-08,"We’re all a bit on edge today as hot-tempered Mars forms a tense square with giant Jupiter in the early hours of the day, casting a red haze over everything. Fortunately, the Moon is in clear-thinking Aquarius and forming a supportive sextile to the Sun in expansive Sagittarius at 10:57 am EST, helping us see the bigger picture and not get carried away. Once the Moon makes another sextile to messenger Mercury this evening, our thoughts and our actions finally start to sync up.","Your energy levels are going through the roof today as your ruling planet, Mars, forms a combustible square with expansive Jupiter. Mars is in your 8th House of Intimacy while Jupiter is in your very social 11th house, so a group gathering or some other kind of big to-do could pop up. While you may normally welcome this, today you might not be in the mood to interact with others, preferring your own company instead. If people just get in the way, then take a step back for yourself.","You’ve been pushing uphill for so long and probably making some good progress with lucky Jupiter moving through your career sector. Today, however, energizer Mars in your relationship sector creates a rough angle with Jupiter, checking that progress with an uncomfortable shove. Someone might be feeling neglected while you put all your focus on work, and they could start demanding you focus on them instead of constantly trying to reach the next level of success. Balance is key to getting through the day.","It’s important to grow and to learn new things, but today you need to make sure that you aren’t growing so fast that you forget to firm up your foundation and end up toppling over. Action planet Mars is in your 6th House of Daily Work and Routine and conflicting with expansive Jupiter in your 9th House of Breadth, reminding you to make sure you are keeping your feet on the ground and achieving everything you need to here and now. Your adventures can wait a day or two.","You’re probably going to feel exceptionally expressive today, even if you're the kind of Cancer that normally prefers to hide in your shell. Feel free to blow your own horn and find any spotlight available to step into. Still, someone might ask you to tone down your shine when you least expect it, which could leave you scratching your head because you wouldn't expect this reaction from them. Don’t take it to heart -- listen to your own opinions and feelings and live this day for yourself.","You could have some lovely plans set with a close friend or romantic partner today, only to find these plans get waylaid by one thing or another. Demanding Mars is setting off sparks in your home sector and conflicting with Jupiter in your partnership sector, so you might have to put all your focus into putting out fires under your own roof. If you need to take a raincheck, your companion should be very understanding, but if not, it tells you a lot about them.","Busy, busy, busy is your vibe for the day, Virgo. Energetic Mars and live-out-loud Jupiter are forming a rare and difficult square across your work and social sectors, which could leave you with your head spinning as you try to bounce from one task to the next. Be patient with yourself and with everyone else because distractions are bound to come one after the other. Don’t put a premium on efficiency today -- you can check off any necessary boxes tomorrow.","You've probably had some wonderful opportunities to manifest things that bring you joy as bountiful Jupiter has been spinning through your 5th House of Romance and Creativity. Today, however, aggressive Mars in your financial sector is going to form a tough square to Jupiter, reminding you of all the things you have to accomplish in the here and now. Accept that life wants you to work, rather than play, for the time being. Pleasure will still be waiting when your plate is clear.","Your fuse is going to be shorter than usual today, Scorpio. Warrior Mars is moving through your intense sign, and while this normally gives you a lot of extra energy, that energy becomes aggressive today as Mars sideswipes expansive Jupiter in your 4th House of Inner Needs and Feelings. Try to do some exercise that allows you to work off the edge because you could easily hurt someone’s feelings if you lash out in the wrong direction.","Although you might feel like you're headed in a solid direction one minute, the next minute you could get completely turned around and end up more than a little confused. Today’s energy is about as smooth as a rockslide, so be prepared to take some detours as you try to make it through your schedule. Instead of forcing things to happen just as you'd planned, accepting what comes as it comes can make your day a bit easier.","You’re already known for being one of the most hardworking signs out there, Capricorn, and expansive Jupiter's presence in your money sector has likely resulted in even more work for you lately. Today, however, warrior Mars is in your social sector and competing with Jupiter, reminding you of all the people who want you to come out and play. Success won't feel as great if you're celebrating it alone, so make some time to enjoy the company of others today and nurture the relationships that make life worth living.","You could go very far and achieve a lot today, as long as you don't run too fast or attempt to go too far because you could wind up tripping over yourself and falling back much further than you'd expect. It's still a wonderful time to put forth effort toward your professional projects and goals, just be sure you move at an even so you don't have to spend more time later on redoing work or correcting errors.","Reality may seem very far from your mind today, and while you love floating around in dreamland more than any other sign, be careful you don’t lose yourself in it. You could be tempted with many possibilities right now, but which of them are actually worth chasing after? Even if the world looks like a watercolor landscape, try to see it as clearly as possible because you’re going to have to make decisions eventually and your judgment should not be blurred."
2021-12-09,"We might wake up on the wrong side of the bed today thanks to the temperamental Moon's conjunction with magnifying Jupiter in the early hours, followed by her harsh square with brooding Mars. It'll be all too easy to turn minor situations into bigger problems if we're not able to keep our attitudes in check. Fortunately, the Moon slips into understanding and compassionate Pisces at 9:53 am EST, reminding us to take things easy and not force any situations. Let things unfold.","It’s a good day to move out of the fast lane and let yourself coast along at a gentler speed. The Moon enters your sleepy 12th House of Solitude and Subconscious this morning, gifting you with an opportunity to rest up and enjoy some quiet time to rejuvenate. You’ll need your engines full for when you have to blast off again in a few days, so make sure to take care of yourself while you can and pay attention to your needs.","Your connections with others become a higher priority today as the sentimental Moon moves into your 11th House of Friendship. This is a reminder that sometimes you need to put work on the backburner to make time for the people you care about. Regardless of whether you’ve got a full schedule ahead of you or nothing but free time, make an effort to reach out, especially if there's anyone who has drifted beyond your sphere lately. Reconnecting can help bring your energy and mood back to center.","Your working life gets a jolt today as the intuitive Moon zips into your career sector, helping you make the right moves that can lead to success. Hit the ground running and be ready to show people what you can do at a moment’s notice! There’s a chance you’ll have the opportunity to impress a VIP or boss, and you can pass this test with flying colors as long as you put in the effort. Don’t sit back and wait for things to happen -- you’ve got progress to make.","You have a lot of support to expand your world today, whether it’s literally or figuratively. The Moon is moving into your boundless 9th House of Culture and Higher Learning, turning on the invisible light bulb over your head. Do something to broaden your views, whether it's opening up a book on a subject you’ve always wanted to study or making plans for a trip that will expose you to new people, places, and experiences. There’s life out there, and it’s waiting for you.","Be prepared to turn inward and take a good, hard look at yourself, Leo. The Moon slips into your intense 8th House of Transformation and Deep Bonding today, so you’re probably not in a lighthearted or easygoing mood. It’s a good day to cut through the fat to get to the heart of any pressing matters. If you’ve been holding off on addressing any personal shortcomings or issues in connecting with others, then consider this your cosmic green light. You can make big changes right now.","The way you handle your partnerships is up for review today as the Moon enters your relationship sector. When it comes to your most important one-on-one connections, it's time to think less along the lines of “me” and more along “we.” If you've been favoring yourself and your own needs while leaving your greatest supporters out in the cold, a recalibration is in order. It's natural that relationships won't be equally balanced 100% of the time, but this is a day to get back on the same page.","Your attention is being drawn toward your own health and well-being today, and you have the universe's support to take some positive steps toward feeling better. Look around your life at the details -- nutrition, workload, physical activity, mental and emotional demands -- and see how you can make small adjustments for big improvements. If you’re judicious and determined, then you’ll be able to make some really clever fixes that your future self will be thankful for.","You might feel like some barriers around you are being lifted today, giving you more opportunity to enjoy the world around you. The Moon is dancing into your 5th House of Pleasure today, so do something that brings a smile to your face. Whether that means a creative hobby, hanging out with friends, or going somewhere you enjoy, make it a point to not only meet your needs, but your wants as well -- they are very important to living a fulfilled life.","Reconnecting with your roots could create a lot of fulfillment, purpose, and understanding for you today. Think about what, who, and where you come from and examine how your early stages turned you into the person you are now. If you can, spend some time catching up with a parent or a sibling, especially if you don’t speak all that often. Getting in some bonding moments can do wonders for your spirit and your sense of belonging.","Life picks up the pace today as the Moon steps into your busy 3rd House of Communication and Information this morning, making it imperative that you keep your eye on the ball. Fortunately, your sign tends to stay on top of things without much effort, but an extra bit of effort might be required nonetheless. There’s a lot coming your way, but if you can stay focused and methodical, you’ll be able to handle it all with flying colors.","It’s a good day to get back to basics, especially when it comes to matters of money and material security. The Moon moves into your 2nd House of Income and Possessions today, so go through your recent spending and make sure you’ve been crossing every T and dotting every I because something might have slipped through the cracks. You could still be paying for a service you no longer require, so cancel that subscription and you’ll save yourself good money in the long run.","You’re very good at making time for other people, but have you been making enough time for yourself? If your desires or needs have been getting pushed to the side, then you need to recalibrate and ensure that you're giving yourself the attention you deserve. Don’t think of ""me time"" as a selfish thing -- you need it in order to be at your best for the people in your life. Do something today that's just for you."
2021-12-10,"The gentle Moon swims through dreamy Pisces today, but she'll also form several aspects that will help us perk up and deal with reality. Early in the morning she'll slip into an easy angle with unpredictable Uranus, so it might not be a quiet start to the day. The evening is potent as well, when Luna and the headstrong Sun square off to pull us in different directions. A late conjunction between the Moon and Neptune at 10:50 pm EST may soften any harsh edges.","You've got permission from the universe to put your desires front and center today, and there isn't anyone who can tell you otherwise! Think about what brings you the most fulfillment in the world, something that makes your heart sing with joy, and focus all your energy into manifesting that or bringing it closer to you. Stepping outside your comfort zone to find your passions can bring incredible happiness and help you view the world with unclouded eyes -- perhaps even through some rose-colored glasses.","Positive energy is bounding your way at this very moment, and it looks as though it won't be arriving all by itself. These beautiful possibilities are going to be directed at you from other people, most likely from a friend or a friend-of-a-friend. It's a wonderful day to give someone a call and make up for any lost time between you! Instead of hiding away, make an effort to connect in whatever way you can. Your efforts will likely be rewarded.","The stars are pushing you up the career ladder today, and you'd do well to let them give you a boost without making a fuss. Skillfully completed jobs might be noticed by a supervisor or other VIP, which could translate into a nice raise or bonus for you. There's no reason to rest on your laurels! Even if you'd rather take it easy, this progress probably won't require you to break a sweat, so you can wow others and yourself with how much you achieve.","The universe is acting kind of like a life coach for you today, pushing you to get your act together and make sure that you've been taking proper care of yourself. You don't need to live a completely ascetic existence, but you should be doing what you can to eat well, get regular exercise, and have achievable goals. If you've wandered a bit too far into indulgent or unhealthy territory, it's time to get back on track and treat your body right.","You may feel driven forward today, but that doesn't mean you need to climb every mountain you can see or worry that you aren't achieving your goals fast enough. Rather, it's time to do a check-in and see if those goals are actually waiting for you at the end of the path you're on. If you look ahead and see that they aren't, then it might be time for some course corrections. Take a step back and get some perspective, then start again.","The day starts off on a quiet note for you, so you're welcome to take things slow and not rush through anything -- although you've never been one to lose track of the details. The mood should pick up come the evening, however, giving you a fresh burst of energy that may inspire you to turn your attention toward your own desires and nothing else. Do something that will bring you joy, and don't worry about what other people might say!","Today isn't just about you -- its focus is more on your relationships with the important people in your life. If things have become a bit one-sided, whether on your side or on theirs, then consider checking to see if the scales are balanced and whether or not everyone's pulling their appropriate weight while still enjoying the connection. Make sure you're doing your part, but if someone else isn't doing theirs, then it's alright to call them out and improve the situation.","Positivity is coming your way today! While you might have work in front of you, you don't have to let any doldrums take center stage -- not when you deserve to be the star. Take control of your day by stepping into the spotlight and putting on a little show, even just an impromptu one, to remind people how wonderfully capable you are. If you have any creative projects on the backburner, get ready to move them onto the heat.","Something heavy might try to weigh you down right now, but things are probably better than you think. The best way to handle this may be to dive in and immerse yourself in it. There could be issues you've been procrastinating solving -- if so, you should give them some attention to see what you can fix and what might need some outsourcing. If you leave these things for too long you might get burned, so deal with them now rather than waiting another day!","Communication is highlighted at this time, encouraging you to check in with anyone you might have lost touch with over the last year or so. You don't need to show up with your hat in hand, apologizing and hoping people will understand why you've been MIA. They should understand more than you could know, and you'll probably have a lot of fun once you get on the phone and start catching up. They might even have something important to tell you, so reach out!","It's a good day to let the universe take the wheel, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing at all! There is some very beautiful energy channeling throughout the cosmos, and it will be impacting you in rather fantastical ways. Instead of trying to push or pull in one specific direction, give yourself permission to be flexible and see how things unfold. Something you're not aware of could be on the horizon, and it may greatly benefit you in the long run.","You've got a lot of dreams and a lot of ideas, Pisces, but you may need to ask yourself what really matters to you and what's just for fun. When was the last time you took a step back to look at your goals? An opportunity for clarification in your life is at hand, as long as you remember who you are and who you want to be. Make sure you're giving your best in an authentic way. This time, you are the main character!"
2021-12-11,"It's an exceptionally busy day for the stars above, with the receptive Moon forming a handful of aspects throughout the morning, but these angles will pale in comparison to the other crackling vibrations. We're forced to examine our deepest desires thanks to a potent conjunction between pleasure-loving Venus and transformative Pluto in no-nonsense Capricorn, while a sextile between energetic Mercury and generous Jupiter magnify all our ideas. This all happens before the Moon enters Aries at 4:46 pm EST, so prepare for a wild ride!","The road is currently open for you to make major career progress, thanks to a fabulous conjunction between ardent Venus and keen Pluto in your 10th House of Professional Goals. Venus wants to give you gifts, while Pluto is all about establishing power, so a VIP or other supervisor could recognize any hard work you've been putting in lately. This could pay off with a very nice reward. If no one seems to notice you, then go ahead and blow your own horn!","The world has some incredible things to offer you today. Don't limit yourself to your own backyard -- get out there and see everything that's happening! Your ruler, sweet Venus, is coming into a rare alignment with extraordinary Pluto in your 9th House of Travel and Expansion, so you could have some very enjoyable and eye-opening experiences. Be ready to immerse yourself in the unknown and you'll likely love everything you have to find. It's not such a small world, after all.","Life turns up the heat today as luxurious Venus blends with death-defying Pluto in your intense 8th House of Intimacy and Shared Resources. This could spell out some very deep romantic scenarios in the skies above, but it may also signal a large cash windfall or another kind of unexpected bounty your way. People should be more willing than normal to open their wallets, so if you've been hoping to secure some financial aid, this is the perfect time to make your pitch!","A relationship could go through a major transformation today, but it seems it will be generally for the best. Beautifying Venus is coming into a rare conjunction with alchemical Pluto in your partnership sector, putting the focus on any plus-ones, whether they're romantic, platonic, or professional. If you need help completing a project, go ahead and ask for help! The person who shows up could change your life -- you'll likely be quite pleased with any results that come out of it.","You usually don't have a problem with feeling confident in yourself, Leo, but today the planets are offering you the chance to find any cracks in your exterior and not only fix them, but transform them into something much better! If you've been sleeping on your exercise routine or letting your health fall in some other way, an overhaul might be something to look into. When you start living life better, you could see the results very quickly. You've got what it takes!","Life may feel a bit like a beauty pageant today, and while your sign isn't exactly known for jumping into the spotlight, there's a chance you could sweep the whole competition! Glamorous Venus is aligning with zealous Pluto in your 5th House of Creative Expression, making this the perfect moment for you to show off a little -- or a lot -- more than usual. Go ahead and trumpet your achievements! You deserve to have all eyes on you every once in a while.","Libra is considered an inherently friendly sign, being ruled by lovely Venus, and today you express this side of yourself -- preferably through your home environment.

You could receive some very interesting news or find something wonderfully unexpected just down the street. A magical breeze is blowing your way, and no matter what it's bringing to you, you're practically guaranteed to love it.","You could conjure up some real money magic today, so get to work early with your sleeves rolled up and be ready to make it rain. Passionate Venus and powerful Pluto are aligning in your 2nd House of Earned Income and Material Goods for an incredibly potent and profitable experience. If you're hoping for a raise, this is a good time to ask! You might also find a new professional opportunity that potentially offers a lot more money than you currently earn.","You've got a special kind of magnetism at the moment, Capricorn, thanks to the fact that you're the very lucky host of today's game-changing conjunction between beautifying Venus and provocative Pluto, both currently camped out in your sign. This is the perfect time to change up your look or style, whether it be with a new hairdo or a whole new wardrobe. Pluto doesn't do anything by halves, so don't be shocked if you're in the mood for an extreme and totally fresh look.","Your fantasies can take you far, and right now they could carry you to lands beyond your wildest dreams! Pleasure-loving Venus and power-player Pluto are coming together in your 12th House of Endings and Dreams, meaning today's events might suddenly feel like you're walking through a painting or surrealist film. Don't fight this energy -- instead, give yourself over to it. You'll probably love whatever unique experiences come your way, so get on board and let the current carry you wherever it chooses.","It's a good day to link up with your friends, because you are sure to have an unforgettable experience together. Venus, the goddess of pleasure, is aligning with game-changing Pluto, to make this an especially auspicious day for socializing. Someone could bring a special opportunity your way, perhaps knowing of just what you've been needing -- something you might not have even known was missing. Don't hide yourself away, because the universe wants you to hear this! Let people share its message with you."
2021-12-12,"We’re looking at the world through a blurred lens today as the Sun in Sagittarius forms a complicated square to Neptune, the planet of mysticism and magic. We would be wise to hold off on any major decisions or important plans because they are likely to slip through the cracks and become nothing more than lost daydreams. Fortunately, a grounding angle between the confident Aries Moon and sober Saturn at 11:50 am EST provides us with a window when we can think clearly.","Watch where you’re going today because it’ll be easy to get lost along the way. The Sun in your expansive 9th house is setting you out on the path of adventure and encouraging you to see the world with fresh eyes, but a tense square from deceiving Neptune in your subconscious sector could lead you astray. It’s alright if you make a few missteps, just try not to go too far down any bizarre paths. You can turn around and start again tomorrow.","You might want to keep your cards close to your chest today, or you may choose to lay them all out on the table. A strange alignment between the Sun in your 8th House of Privacy and Neptune in your friendship and networking sector is going to have you bouncing back and forth between these two options, and trying to find a place to land won’t be easy. Try to avoid any social situations that don’t meet your needs because they will likely be very draining to your spirit.","You’re probably quite ready to enjoy yourself with a special companion today, but no matter what exciting plans you have in the works, something else is liable to pop up and throw everything for a loop. The Sun in your partnership sector is forming a very confusing square to nebulous Neptune in your professional 10th house, so even if you have the day off, some kind of work might require your attention. Unfortunately, progress in either area might not be attainable until clarity returns.","It’s a good day to organize your life for the week ahead -- buying groceries, cleaning house, and taking care of any lingering chores. You might have to try especially hard to stay on task, though, because it'll be all too easy for you to lose focus and waste hours daydreaming or dilly-dallying. It’s perfectly fine to take some time here and there to let your mind wander, but if you wander too far, you could feel quite unproductive and unprepared by the end of the day.","Make a point to enjoy yourself as much as you possibly can today as the Sun is warming up your expressive 5th House of Pleasure. Just keep in mind that confusing Neptune is forming a difficult angle to the Sun, so you might feel something nagging at the back of your mind, even if you can’t figure out what it is. Still, don’t let strange thoughts get in the way of an otherwise lovely day -- Neptune’s bark is worse than its bite.","Someone could do or say something today that leaves you conflicted. While the Sun in your emotional sector is interacting in a rough way with Neptune in your partnership sector, someone you're close with might be able to push your buttons whether you like it or not. Although it doesn't feel good to feel vulnerable, if this person sincerely wants to help, then their clumsy approach is forgivable. However, if they aren’t doing it in good spirit, you might need to block them out, even if only for today.","It’s a lovely day to do as you please, catching up with friends and socializing in a way that only a Libra can. While you’re so busy touching base with people, however, Neptune in your 6th House of Work and Chores is going to be demanding attention, although it may not be very clear why. Is there something you forgot to do that must get done before the new week begins? Make sure your responsibilities aren’t slipping through the cracks.","Financial matters and practical responsibilities may be weighing on your mind, making the day's activities feel rather mundane. In order to liven things up, you might be tempted to splurge on some shiny object or exciting event, but you would be wise to hold off because there’s a good chance whatever it is won’t be worth it. Instant gratification will probably be tough to turn down, but if you can practice patience, something much better could come along.","You could suddenly feel as if someone has pulled the rug out from under you today. There's a lot of focus on you while the Sun is moving through your sign, but thanks to a difficult square with murky Neptune in your emotional sector, it's nearly impossible to see things for what they truly are. You could feel like nothing makes sense today and that everything that was solid is now up in the air, but just hold tight because clarity will return again soon.","Trying to understand others could feel like you're translating an alien language today. While the Sun is in your subconscious sector and conflicting with strange Neptune in your communication sector, it can be incredibly difficult to get down to the matter at hand. Beating around the bush is probably the best you can do for now, so you would be wise to hit pause on any important matters. You'll have more success once these bizarre vibrations die down.","You tend to be rather generous by nature, Aquarius, but while it’s a lovely thing to occasionally treat others, today, that impulse could wind up backfiring in your direction. There’s a fog hanging over your finances, making it easy to think you can spend a certain amount, only to turn around and realize you would have been much wiser to keep your wallet shut. Let everyone look out for themselves for now -- true friends won’t expect you to cover their share.","There’s no point in rushing anywhere today because that’s the surest way to burn out. Considering it’s the weekend, you might be in the mood to just go with the flow, but someone else might try to push you to do something you're really not up for. There's no need to sacrifice your relaxation just to please someone else, so don’t feel bad about taking a raincheck. Once the busy week begins, you'll probably be glad you saved up your energy."
2021-12-13,"This is a busy day in the skies overhead, so be prepared for some major shifts. Action planet Mars will join the radiant Sun in Sagittarius in the early hours, kicking off a six-week window for action on our plans, while energetic Mercury will bound into Capricorn at 12:52 pm EST, setting a tone of work and discipline. The evocative Moon is in Aries all day, making a number of potent aspects, so our energy levels are likely to be through the roof.","This morning dawns speedily as messenger Mercury zooms into your 10th House of Goals to put the day's focus on your achievements. Mercury brings lots of action and energy in his wake, so you can expect the pace toward your future to pick up at the office or wherever it is you go to work -- even if it's at home. If you're hoping to find a new professional opportunity, then start perusing! You'll likely have plenty of good options to choose from.","Go ahead and start thinking in global terms, because today inquisitive Mercury enters your boundless 9th House of Foreign Cultures and Higher Learning for his annual tour. This is a terrific time to broaden the scope of your life! Whether you decide to do some actual traveling or to research as an armchair explorer, make an effort to expose yourself to new concepts and ways of being. You may easily get stuck in a rut, Taurus, so don't miss this chance to spread your wings.","Get ready to start thinking on the level of Sherlock Holmes today when cosmic communicator Mercury slips into your mysterious 8th House of Intimacy and Shared Resources. This dramatic transit may make things feel more like a detective novel than real life, with countless layers to look through. While there might be a lot of lines to read between, don't let them completely obscure the facts of reality. You can only unravel something so much before there's nothing left to work with.","Someone, or some very specific people, could be about to start playing a much larger role in your life. Loquacious Mercury enters your 7th House of Partnerships today, turning up the volume on your most important connections. This is about more than simply romantic relationships -- it covers any type of equal partnership, including professional and platonic ones. Since this house also rules contracts, you might be fielding a few exciting offers! Be prepared to sign on the dotted line if necessary.","Things are about to pick up at work, so get ready to roll up your sleeves and put your nose to the grindstone! Vivacious Mercury enters your 6th House of Work and Routine today, bringing a lot of energy and action to your daily life. Since Mercury naturally rules this sector, this theme will be doubly amplified. You should get ready for clients or coworkers to bring more issues to your door, but there's no reason you can't solve them all with style.","You're being called to focus on fun, Virgo! Today your ruler, intelligent Mercury, dances into your passionate 5th House of Love and Creativity, putting you in the mood to round out the year on a very positive note. Whether or not you're romantically entangled, this is a great time to pursue matters of the heart, so do whatever brings you joy. It is also the sector of fame, so a project you've been working on could earn you some time in the spotlight!","Your attention could be centered on your home for the next couple of weeks as lively Mercury jumps into your 4th House of Family and Foundations. Don't be shocked if it seems almost impossible to find any quiet time under your roof for the time being, since it's highly probable that there's going to be a lot more activity in your domestic environment. Consider leaning into this by hosting some events at your home to show off what a good host you are!","The pace picks up currently as speedy Mercury zooms into Capricorn and your 3rd House of Community and Socialization, reminding you of all the things happening around you. Mercury naturally rules this house, so this energy should feel very natural -- but you might need to prepare yourself for a lot more events and appointments than you've had in quite a while! In addition, this is a great time for written work, so if you've got a message then go ahead and share it.","Money may be on your mind at the moment, because today cerebral Mercury jumps into your 2nd House of Earned Income and Material Assets, helping you cut through the fog and deal with any mundane matters clamoring for your attention. This is one of the best times of the year for increasing your financial standing, especially if you use your mind to try and improve your situation. There are options waiting for you to explore them, so start seeking out a strong revenue stream.","You're likely putting on your thinking cap right now, as clever Mercury bounds into your sign! Everything is probably going to seem much clearer, like a picture coming into focus -- in return, you may have quite a lot of things to say about what you see. New ideas should be coming to you in the weeks ahead thanks to this transit, so don't hesitate to give them their fair share of attention. You're coming up with these possibilities for a reason!","Life may feel like you've tuned in to a strange radio program for a while as mercurial Mercury dives into Capricorn and your 12th House of Secrets today. Everything could seem rather foggy during this time, as though you just didn't get enough sleep to process information during the day, so make an effort to be gentle with yourself as needed. This is also a very inspiring transit, so it's a good period to get creative and see what comes of it!","It's time to connect, as perky Mercury enters Capricorn today to set up camp in your social sector and remind you of all the people you know. If you've lost touch with any important people in your life, then now is the perfect moment to start fixing that! Make a point to check in with everyone and see what they've been up to -- chances are good you'll discover some very interesting bits of information from a friend or even an acquaintance."
2021-12-14,"We're being asked to take a slower approach to life as the Moon leaves fiery Aries and slips into easy-going Taurus at 3:11 am EST this morning, setting a gentler pace for the next couple of days. Early on she'll move into a lovely trine with messenger Mercury in Capricorn, lending us a can-do spirit that can carry us through to the end of the day. However, a late square between Luna and responsible Saturn could still force us to call it an early night.","Matters of money and career are front and center today, and you'd be wise to start the day off on a professional foot. You might want to arrive at work early, ready for any important moment to come your way and boost you up the career ladder. Bosses and other VIPs could be watching, so don't shy away from the spotlight! The stars have got your back, so there's no need to worry you won't pull off something fantastic. You've got this in the bag!","Life has countless possibilities, but it can be difficult to consider or even just see them all if you get stuck and forget there are other ways of doing things. Today, examine how different people approach matters, and see if you can't learn something from them! Their methods may help you shake up your routine in new and amazing ways. You know a great deal, but that doesn't mean you know everything. Don't let pride get in the way of a good learning experience.","Growth takes time and patience -- no matter how smart you are. Today, sitting back and reflecting might have better results than chasing every possibility that comes into view. If you do want to do something or be active, make an effort to approach life differently than usual. When you change your view on something, what are the results? Don't worry about coming up with any specific solutions, because they could form when you stop pushing and let your mind flow naturally.","There's a gorgeous light in the stars today! You're being called to take advantage of it and enjoy yourself as much as possible. While it can be easy to get shunted off to the side and hide within yourself when times are difficult, that's not at all what you should do right now. Instead, meet up with some friends for a nice meal or go out to take in some sights that make you feel more connected to the wonderful world around you.","You might already be making an effort to present the best version of yourself at this moment, but if you try a little bit harder to improve the few areas where you might be lacking, you could become something truly impressive. Search out new options and ways to improve yourself today. Admitting weakness doesn't mean that you are weak -- it simply means that there's room for you to grow! Ask yourself what you need to do in order to grow closer to the sun.","Something may be pulling at your spirit today, like a wind from another time, reminding you of something you may have never even experienced before. Do you believe in past lives? Whether or not you do, some strange and unusual feelings might present themselves to you today, ones that aren't easily explained even by someone with your logical disposition. Let yourself at least entertain the idea of something impossible -- you never know, it might turn out to be possible after all!","There's no point in pounding on a wall and hoping it will turn into a door. While sometimes it might be a good idea to persevere with something, especially when you want it really badly, today you'd be wiser to change up your approach. Take a backseat instead of trying to be the driver -- you may find that you come across a door where you never expected to find one! Let life take you there and don't direct when you should follow.","Your loved ones probably only want the best for you, so even if you aren't the most trusting sign by nature, Scorpio, it's OK to put your faith in others for now. Go ahead and share your deepest thoughts with someone you hold close -- it could do wonders to bring you two closer together. No one is an island, especially in this day and age. Even if you separate yourself enough to be a peninsula, you're still connected to the rest of humanity.","A pleasant efficiency infuses today, one which can help you get exactly where you need to be. If you've been feeling like you're not at your best, then try and use positive thinking to trick your mind into performing at a higher capacity. Instead of focusing on your flaws or areas where you feel lacking, put all your energy into what you do best and let everyone else see your efforts for what they are: extraordinary! You might be just as impressed as they are.","You're normally one of the most disciplined signs of the zodiac, Capricorn, and while that's all well and good, currently you've got cosmic clearance to leave work behind and do as your heart desires! There's a beautiful alignment between the impressionable Moon in your pleasure sector and mental Mercury in your sign, so you're going to be in an especially creative mental place. Don't do things the same way you always do them -- try changing up your life and seeing what happens!","We live in an age where we don't need to be as conscious of the daily rhythms of Earth in comparison to our ancestors, but we might have lost a few things in the process of technological advancement. Try to spend a few hours in nature today if you can, and see what you can learn from the world. Getting back in touch with your roots and the facts of life that connect you to the earth can be an incredibly grounding and nurturing experience.","Sometimes getting attached to a community without even realizing it is all too easy, and it might turn out that you don't have as much in common with them as you once thought. As the planets move through the various social sectors of your chart at this time, take a fresh look at the people and groups you spend time with. You might want to look for people who better appreciate your special qualities in order to feel more secure in yourself and your friendships."
2021-12-15,"There's something unusual sparking through the skies early this morning, as the shining Moon in Taurus aligns with rebellious Uranus and encourages us to march to the beat of our own drum. Unusual approaches will benefit us more than tried-and-true paths, so we shouldn't shy away from the unknown. Fanciful Neptune will form a beautiful and supportive sextile with the Moon at 8:21 pm EST, opening us up to the endless possibilities waiting out in the great wide yonder. There are no limits today!","Let the dawn light invigorate you this morning! If you don't have a daily plan already set in stone, take the first few minutes of your day to write down a list of things to accomplish, preferably including something you've been putting off for longer than necessary. Don't even give yourself the time to question this plan of action -- just do it. You could be pleasantly surprised how much you can get done when you turn off your brain and roll up your sleeves!","A deep need to break out of any confining boundaries or expectations people have laid at your door could overtake you today, as radical Uranus syncs up with the temperamental Moon at the exact same degree. Even if you normally prefer to follow tried-and-true methods, a bit of rebellion and surprise might do wonders for your inner satisfaction. As wonderful as communities can be, sometimes you need to stand on your own in order to find your own peace of mind.","It might feel as though there are chaotic voices in your head when both the emotional Moon and erratic Uranus sync up in your sleepy subconscious sector today. Instead of trying to make sense of it all, lean into the unique vibes and let yourself spend the day hanging out in the slow lane. As you sit with the emotions and ideas that may bubble up from unseen territory, allow any mystical messages to really sink in. You could uncover something truly magical!","Having fun is good for your heart, no matter how old you are -- especially today! This isn't about going to a club or barhopping with friends, but rather the kind of light-hearted fun that children have when they go sledding or roll down a grassy hill. Let loose today, preferably with some friends, and give yourself permission to goof off like kids again. It might do your spirit a world of good, and you can get back to your responsibilities later.","It is important not to listen to what people say too much of the time, but every once in a while, it's also wise to take the pulse of the situation! Consider your reputation amongst your peers and ask yourself if you're happy with the way people view you. If you aren't satisfied, you can take steps to fix it, like making effort to ensure that people know what you're about and that you haven't left them behind in the dust.","You could want to step out of your comfort zone, and fortunately for you, the process doesn't have to be uncomfortable! Look beyond your usual experiences and what you tend to do on a daily basis. Is there some room for bending your internal rules? If you follow the same patterns, any change is highly unlikely. Right now, though, the universe strongly encourages change! Take your cues from distant places and diverse cultures -- trying something unfamiliar to you could have amazing results.","There's a spark of inspiration traveling throughout the skies today, and you might feel as though it's resonating deep within you on a level that other people don't get to see very often. Consider taking time away from everyone to do some soul-searching. Are there some behaviors you could stand to let go of? Think about the Phoenix rising from the ashes, stronger and wiser than before, then try to show others just how much you can change from the inside out!","A surprise might come your way today! It may arrive from a very specific person in your life, most likely a peer with whom you stand on equal footing. This person could be a friend, a co-worker, or even a lover, but they might really go against the grain of your expectations. There's nothing wrong with that -- the surprise may in fact be one you enjoy immensely! Still, it's best to be prepared for any potential situation. Expect the unexpected!","There may be some professional mountains in your path today, so getting some stretches before you have to start climbing would be a good idea. Consider going for a jog this morning or clearing a space in your home to do some gentle exercise -- perhaps while burning a scented candle or calming incense. When the first thing you do in the day is wake up your body and mind, it will help you take charge of the rest of the day that much more.","Beauty pirouettes through the air today, and it's giving your permission to do as you please and leave your work or other obligations waiting for you to return to them under less indulgent skies. In the meantime, it's OK to take a few extra minutes getting dressed this morning by putting on some of your favorite clothes or spending a little longer in front of the mirror. Then, go do something expressive to let this morning's spark become something tangible. Show people your talent!","Your home might feel a bit too small today! Luckily, if you're sick of looking at the same four walls, you can scratch that itch without calling in the movers. Consider simply spending some time browsing interior design pages and furniture websites, perhaps even looking at a few new paint colors. You don't have to change zip codes to get a fresh feel in your own space. A few small updates can vastly improve your sense of being truly grounded at home.","There are likely many technological distractions in your daily life, but using simple tools like pen and paper to try and write out your thoughts could unlock some wonderfully deep feelings within you. Try to find time to journal today, writing down whatever comes into your mind. Don't expect too much in terms of output -- just give yourself permission to free-write and see what comes out. Be it a poem, a story, or just your thoughts, give your mind space to jot them down."
2021-12-16,"This morning presents us with an opportunity to go big or go home, as the emotional Moon in stubborn Taurus squares off against free-thinking Jupiter, causing a bit of a ruckus. The momentum picks up when the Moon enters Gemini at 3:43 pm EST, giving us lots of things to think about and even more to discuss. Things could even bubble over into something extreme when ferocious Mars sends out a potent opposition late this evening, so we should prioritize clear communication.","The universal pace picks up today as the intuitive Moon slips out of plodding Taurus and dives into mercurial Gemini early this afternoon. Take the morning at a steady pace, tending to any tasks in a responsible but not hurried fashion, then give yourself permission to be a bit freer in the latter half of the day, buzzing about and touching base with friends as you see fit. This evening is lovely for linking up with people, so lean into some sociable fun!","You might be more in your own head than usual this morning -- at least until the changeable Moon leaves your sign to enter Gemini and your grounded 2nd House later in the day, supplying you with more productive inspiration. Getting serious about your work will help you finish the day on a strong note, but an even stronger influence from passionate Mars in the evening could lead you down an entirely different path! You may find yourself in some very intimate and powerful places.","Things may feel rather fantastical this morning, as the inspirational Moon finishes up her visit to your sleepy 12th House and zips into your sign, lighting you up from within! You'll likely feel this surge of energy almost like clockwork once she moves, so remember that it's okay to take things easy early on before switching gears and focusing. Ambitious Mars in your partnership sector will be begging for attention in the evening, so it's a good time to link up with a loved one.","Today the cosmos doesn't want to be told to speed up, by you or anyone else -- and you're encouraged to do the same. Just after noon, the sleepy Moon will enter your 12th House of Detoxing and Dreams, putting the focus on self-care and nurturing. Don't do anything you don't want to, even if people bombard you with invitations. Instead, allow yourself an early night in, perhaps with some yoga or other gentle workout routine to help shake off any stress from the day.","Various energies are coming your way at this time, so be prepared to transition between different speeds as the day progresses. The pleasant Moon spends the morning in your 10th House of Career, helping you start things off efficiently, but by the afternoon she'll drift into distractible Gemini and your sector of friends and social groups, so it might be more difficult to focus as the hours pass. The evening should provide opportunities to enjoy yourself, so try to keep it together until then.","You're being asked by the planets to perform at your best today, but that doesn't mean you have to put on an intense show. The calming Moon is wrapping up her journey through your high-minded 9th House this morning, ending a phase that could have given you better ideas about how to approach your life. You can put this knowledge to use when she moves into your career sector in the afternoon. Don't be afraid to use any tricks up your sleeve!","Intense energy fills this morning as the reflective Moon finishes up her tour of Taurus and your 8th House of Soul-Bonding, so don't be shocked if things feel a bit heavy first thing. This theme won't last forever, as the Moon dances into Gemini and your 9th House of Inspiration and Expansion in the afternoon, making the world feel much more open. Try and get out for a bit this evening -- think about meeting up with some friends for dinner or drinks.","No matter how gently today starts off, that trend probably won't continue as time passes. The temperamental Moon will enter Gemini and your 8th House of Sex and Intimacy later in the day, so the temperature is likely going to rise steadily. You don't have to commit to a specific person to feel this energy coming your way, as strong Mars in your personal resource sector may draw your attention to more mundane matters this evening. Work might come calling when you least expect it!","Productive possibilities shine bright this morning, as the lovely Moon begins the day in your 6th House of Work and Health, making it wise to start your own morning with things like waking up early, getting in some exercise, and having a healthy breakfast before diving into any current tasks. This energy changes, however, when the Moon moves into your partnership sector in the early afternoon. You can look forward to a wonderful evening for linking up with close friends!","The stars are letting you do as you please this morning while the evocative Moon spins through your 5th House of Play, so don't force yourself to do anything you don't thoroughly enjoy. After all, you only have a few hours before the Moon shifts into your 6th House of Work and Routine, which you could notice as quite a sudden change in energy. This energy will follow you well into the evening, supporting you as you work on any tasks at hand.","This is a good morning to take your time and move at your own pace, as the domestic Moon spends the first part of the day in your 4th House of Home and Family. Consider tending to any chores around the house or giving your mom a call if you haven't recently. The Moon will move into your fun sector in the second half of the day, so then you'll be able to indulge in something entertaining and leave work and responsibilities for another time.","Your phone might already be blowing up even before your alarm goes off this morning! Busy energies buzz through the dawn air, underlined by the intuitive Moon in your communication sector. Fortunately, you shouldn't have to juggle any calls for too long, as the Moon will slip into your quieter 4th House of Home in the afternoon. The rest of the day will likely allow you the chance to tend to some household matters, so don't feel guilty about having a night in."
2021-12-17,"The planets are offering us a quiet day, one which can be used productively and give us plenty of chances to get ahead if we're smart and don't waste our energy. The domestic Moon is moving through Gemini, helping us formulate our ideas and get organized before the supportive trine from Saturn at 12:57 pm EST will make it easy to bring them to fruition and develop them into more than just what-ifs. If we keep an open mind, then we could go far!","Communicating with others is highly encouraged today, as the chatty Moon in Gemini comes together with karmic Saturn in free-thinking Aquarius, looping in the two platonic social sectors of your chart. With Saturn in the picture, you could learn some very interesting or important news or have a moment with a friend that gives birth to a highly viable idea or opportunity. Either way, this isn't a day to keep to yourself! Circulate and the effort should be well worth it.","You've got your eyes on the prize today, as the impressionable Moon moves into your 2nd House of Earned Income. This afternoon, she'll align with structured Saturn, currently in your 10th House of Career, to help you put your money where your mouth is and make sure you're getting your proper dues. If you've been hoping for a raise or other financial recognition, this is a terrific time to raise the matter with a boss or supervisor. The odds favor you!","You're the focal point of the universe's energy today, as the inspiring Moon in your sign puts the focus on you. Early this afternoon, she'll reach out across the sky to form a lovely trine with structured Saturn in your expansion sector, reminding you of all the possibilities waiting just beyond your own backyard. Consider doing something to increase your knowledge or the way you view the world, like cracking open a new book or signing up for an in-depth course.","Life might feel a little off balance today, as though you're having trouble finding solid ground. Normally, the wisest solution would be not to expect too much out of life. Fortunately, the people around you will likely be more inclined than usual to support you in your time of need -- even if it isn't a critical need. You can't always expect your peers or loved ones to drop what they are doing to help you, but right now, it won't hurt to ask!","There could be a hurdle to jump today when it comes to your relationships! This might have to do with a romantic relationship, but it's more likely to involve a business or platonic partnership. Someone who you consider an equal may bring an important matter to your door. While it might look daunting at first, it should be easier to deal with than you might have originally assumed. Don't let yourself get overwhelmed at first glance, because you'll probably be able to handle it well.","It might seem like nothing happens if you don't make it happen, Virgo, and while it's wonderful that you're so capable, it can probably get a little tiring having to work as hard as you do. That being said, things may not be all that difficult at the moment! Even if you look at all your responsibilities and feel daunted, things probably won't be as bad as they seem. Roll up your sleeves to work and you could sail through everything with flying colors!","It's a good day to break out of any ruts that you might have been keeping yourself in. Serious Saturn is in the midst of a three-year tour of your self-expression sector, reworking the way you engage with life on a major scale. He'll have a great effect this afternoon in particular, as the sociable Moon in your expansion sector aligns with him, encouraging you to learn in a creative way. This kind of growth is important, no matter how uncomfortable it may be.","Showing others your more vulnerable feelings isn't always fun, but it could be quite beneficial at this time. There are many different ways to express emotion and receive it, and sometimes it's fun to be wild and expansive! Today, though, you may be more inclined to show people how you feel in an unusually nurturing way for you, Scorpio. Allow yourself to listen to the stars and approach life -- at least for now -- from a softer side than you might normally choose.","Some deep conversations may be in store for you at the moment, due to the moody Moon in your partnership sector forming a positive angle with sober Saturn in your communications arena to give your tongue a slightly more serious edge. In all your communications, don't bother with any casual conversations today! Instead, try to discuss things that are very important to you on a deeper level, because they can bring you even closer together with peers and partners of any kind.","The serious side of life could come through today. Happily, any changes aren't likely to revolve around dramatic or drastic moments -- instead, they may simply be due to you refusing to accept less than you deserve. Thanks to an angle between the evocative Moon and your ruler, authoritative Saturn, there's no room on your plate for people who can't bring their best. That's not to say you should expect everyone to be constantly perfect, but they should at least try when it's necessary.","Life may currently feel rather daunting, and that's absolutely valid. It's not the easiest thing to put yourself out there and take risks to show people what you're all about. Today you might find yourself on a bit of a precipice, unsure whether you should put yourself front and center or pull back and keep your potential to yourself. While it's wise to exercise a bit of judicious discretion, you also have no reason to be scared of your own wonderful abilities!","Your giving, benevolent nature is almost always beneficial for you and others, but every once in a while -- today in particular -- you might be better served by making someone else meet you at least halfway, if not more. Don't hesitate to focus on yourself and your own needs for the time being. Letting people come to you will help ensure that anyone who decides to come seeking your attention will have an issue or question that's worth your time and attention."
2021-12-18,"We might have a difficult time getting into our grooves this morning as the distractible Moon in Gemini forms a complicated square with dreamy Neptune right as the day begins. It would be a good idea to leave important matters until this afternoon, when Luna flies free without pinging off any planets. Come the evening, we'll witness a potent Full Moon in Gemini at 11:36 pm EST, opening up a portal for major conversations to occur. It's time to say our piece!","Your ideas and thoughts can take you far right now -- even more than usual, due to the Gemini Full Moon powering up your communication sector and encouraging you to speak your mind. Lots of things could be happening! Do your best to stay organized and remain true to your own vision, because people might be paying very close attention to what you have to say. A dynamic partner could appear on the scene soon, so keep your eyes peeled.","There's never been a better time to start looking for a new or better source of income, thanks to today's Gemini Full Moon in your money sector. If your wallet is feeling light, start searching out fresh leads -- a wonderful opportunity could be waiting for you! If you're already happy with where you earn your paycheck, it might be time to discuss a raise. Consider putting together evidence of just how valuable an employee you are to make sure any superiors know your worth.","Today's energy is focused on you, thanks to the beautiful Full Moon occurring in your sign this evening. The stars shine brighter than ever, illuminating all the best parts of you for others to appreciate. If you've got any dreams or desires sitting on the back burner, now would be a wonderful time to move them onto high heat. Current plans aside, some seeds you planted six months ago might now be ready for you to harvest. Many benefits may be available to you now!","Today's Gemini Full Moon is all about conclusions and letting go. Full Moons are generally a time of culmination, and this particular one is specifically impacting your 12th House of Endings and Completions. Take a look around your life, see what bad habits or issues are still lingering, and show them the door! You need to clear your plate before you can add something else, so don't hesitate to get rid of anything you no longer want. Better things are on the horizon.","You have plenty of things to look forward to this evening as the Gemini Full Moon aims the cosmic focus on your friends and larger social groups, bringing you in contact with others to at least plan a fun get-together. If you've lost touch with someone and want to rectify that, this is the perfect time to reach out! Chances are you'll have lots to talk about. This can also positively impact your hopes for the future, so get out there and wish upon a star!","You likely have every reason to be proud right now, Virgo! This evening's Gemini Full Moon could send you some sort of career success or reward, so take some time to celebrate your accomplishments! A project you've been hammering away at could finally reach an ending point or be ready for a final reveal, so look for opportunities to make your big presentation. There's a road opening up in front of you, and it might lead you straight to the top of the mountain.","Even if you don't consider yourself the most adventurous person in the world, it's never too late to try and change up your usual routine for something a little more exciting! Today's beautiful Gemini Full Moon is shining a light on your 9th House of Boundless Horizons, reminding you that there's a whole world out there waiting for you to come and explore it. Leaving your home may not be an option, but you can -- and should! -- still explore new knowledge from home.","Chances are you've heard about a fabled pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. While a literal pot of gold is a myth, today's Full Moon in Gemini is showing you the way to an unexpected metaphorical pot of gold -- you might not even have to follow a rainbow to reach it. Instead of searching for a path, allow the universe to guide you toward the place you need to be in order to obtain a wonderful reward.","People could play an important role in your life as the Gemini Full Moon illuminates your partnership sector this evening, impacting everything from romance to business to friendships. You and a particular peer might decide to get to know one another better, or you might decide that it's time to go your own way toward new things. A contract could also land on your desk soon, so be sure to read the fine print on any documents or offers before signing on the dotted line.","It's time to get your life in order! Whether or not you've let things fall to the wayside, it would be wise to take a moment to remember any resolutions you made at the start of the year and make sure that you're still on track. Things like a healthier diet, your mental health, or just some routine cardio are all good ideas right now. The stars are trying to help you become the best version of yourself, whoever that might be.","You've got permission to put yourself front and center, but that doesn't mean you have to shine alone in the spotlight! Rather than making today all about ""me, myself, and I,"" try and turn your positivity into a group effort -- or at least keep some altruistic urges in mind when making plans. How can you help yourself and help others at the same time? It can get a little lonely out there in center stage, so think about bringing a few performers with you.","Your attention is drawn in the direction of your home and family by the stars themselves, thanks to this evening's Gemini Full Moon illuminating your 4th House of Home and Foundations. It's a wonderful time to change up your space in some way -- if you've been considering moving, that also might start to look more viable! Whatever happens, it's nearly guaranteed to occur under your own roof. This lunar event encourages healing as well, making any necessary forgiveness work easier than normal."
2021-12-19,"Feelings are everything today, particularly once the emotional Moon enters Cancer in the early hours, where she'll set up camp for the next two days. Only an hour or so later, at 5:36 am EST, vulnerable Venus will turn retrograde in Capricorn for the next six weeks -- putting more than a little bit of a dampener on life's pleasures. That being said, this evening promises a dose of positivity as the bright Sun sextiles generous Jupiter to lift the mood considerably.","Your ascent up the career ladder might not move as swiftly and as easily as you would prefer, starting today as relaxed Venus turns retrograde for her semi-annual snooze fest, this time in your 10th House of Professional Ambitions. This isn't the best time for trying to draw attention to yourself in any way, as it will be all too easy for you to hit a wrong note in the process. Hold off on any major reveals until there are clearer skies.","You'll only be able to get so far in life for the next month and a half. While you're very capable in general, Taurus, any issues are thanks to your ruler, emotional Venus, turning retrograde today for the next six weeks in your expansion sector. During this phase, you'll be more inclined to stick to what you know and not step out of your comfort zone. Under this alignment, you've got cosmic clearance to keep your life as simple as possible.","Life takes a turn for the dramatic today as Venus, the Goddess of Love, turns retrograde in your 8th House of Deep Intimacy for the next six weeks. This sector of your chart rules everything from sex to shared financial resources, so while Venus normally eases up any tension around these matters, things might go much less smoothly when she's asleep at the wheel. This isn't the best time to try and create new bonds with someone, so consider keeping to yourself for a while.","Your relationships will probably feel somewhat conflicted for some time as romantic Venus turns retrograde in your 7th House of Partnerships today. This phase can make it too easy to think you and a pal are both on the same page when you're not even looking at the same book! Be careful about trying to forge ahead with any important bonds in the weeks to come, be they romantic, professional, or platonic. Life should be safer as a solo show for now.","The office might be more of a battlefield than normal for the time being, as today impassioned Venus turns retrograde, beginning her six-week backtracking phase through your 6th House of Work and Routine. Coworkers and clients might be less than helpful and much more demanding toward you in the weeks ahead. The pressure they put on your time might give you more than one reason to feel burnt out. Helping others is nice, but you don't have to give more than your fair share.","It might be hard to tell the difference between positive and negative passion for the next six weeks, as emotional Venus turns retrograde in your romance sector today and makes knowing your own feelings extremely difficult. When direct, Venus wants to bring you lots of opportunities to enjoy yourself, but now she's not going to have as much time for that, so don't be discouraged if life doesn't feel as bright as usual. Have faith that the sun will shine again!","Things might be a little complicated on the home front for the foreseeable future. Your ruler, pleasure-loving Venus, turns retrograde today for the next six weeks, effectively making it difficult to enjoy the little things and get along with everyone else. Since this is occurring in your 4th House of Home and Family, be careful about stepping on a relative's or a roommate's toes! It will be too easy for lines to get crossed -- even unintentionally -- during this awkward phase.","Your messages may not hit your intended targets in the way you meant them to, due to love goddess Venus turning retrograde in your communications sector today -- and staying that way until the end of January. Sticking your foot in your mouth will be dangerously easy, so you'd be wise to watch your words more than usual! It would also be smart to hold off on any major declarations to anyone in particular, as even heartfelt messages are likely to veer off course now.","Tighten up your purse strings and put your wallet back in your pocket, Sagittarius. Today, money-loving Venus turns retrograde for six weeks, and she'll be doing so in your grounded 2nd House of Earned Income and Material Possessions. During this time, you might want to wait on any major purchases, as it's likely you won't be happy with the result. You can still have a fun holiday season, but try to find ways of enjoying yourself that don't involve throwing your money around.","You might feel like a bit of a wet blanket as beautiful Venus turns retrograde today for six weeks, marking a time when the world is a little less enjoyable. Unfortunately, since this retrograde movement occurs directly in your sign, you'll probably feel this melancholy even more than other signs. You would be especially wise to hold off on making any major changes to your appearance, because satisfaction isn't likely right now. You'll have a better idea of what you want once Venus turns direct.","Fantastical times may not be as common as they were before once the normally delightful Venus, currently spinning through your fantastical 12th House of the Subconscious, hits the brakes and turns retrograde for the next six weeks. This throws more than a few wrenches in the cosmic works! Love and all the other good aspects of life might feel like they are in short supply during this phase, so be patient with yourself and others if things don't go your way.","Starting today, seeing eye-to-eye with your friends may be harder than usual as stubborn Venus turns retrograde for her semi-annual slumber, this time hitting the hay in your 11th House of Social Groups and Global Communications. In addition to disagreements, Venus's retrograde here may also make it more difficult for you to literally get together with peers. If you seem to be having more disagreements than usual, feel free to blame Venus! Trust that these matters will be sorted out eventually."
2021-12-20,"It's a day for us to make room for the unexpected in our lives, due to Uranus, the planet of surprise, making two potent connections overhead. First, in the early hours, the intuitive Moon will align with him to give a special spark to our dreams. Clever Mercury trines him later in the day, culminating at 3:18 pm EST when our thoughts will shimmer with extra creativity. A late angle between the Moon and healing Neptune could make for an especially lovely evening.","Career and money matters are knocking at your door today, but you might be surprised by what they have to say when you let them in. Messenger Mercury is spinning through your 10th House of Professional Ambitions, helping you line up your thoughts with your goals, and this afternoon he'll form a positive trine with unpredictable Uranus. If you think outside of the box, you could find a way to create a whole new revenue stream or another useful project seemingly out of the blue.","Change could arrive at any moment today, which for a stability-loving Taurus might not be your favorite thing, but there are actually plenty of reasons to embrace new ideas. Energetic Mercury in your expansion sector is forming a lovely angle to change-maker Uranus, who happens to be on an extended visit to your sign. Try to take a different approach to your usual routine -- you never know, you could discover a much better way of doing things! Work smarter, not harder.","There's a bit of a strange buzz in the heavens today, one that might make you feel like you're trying to call someone without any cell signal. Your ruler, vivacious Mercury, is moving through your 8th House of Intensity, and when he makes a positive trine to rebellious Uranus in your hidden 12th House of Spirituality and Inspiration, you could receive some major messages from out of the blue! Any communication right now has huge potential, so don't ignore anything.","You might find your mind continually returning to other people today, so don't brush it off or think you're meant to hide away all by yourself. Chatty Mercury in your relationship sector and quirky Uranus in your social sector will come together to make a beautiful trine overhead -- you may have more fun than you've had in ages! A surprise invitation might fly your way, so be sure to answer any ringing phones and don't hesitate to say yes to fun opportunities!","A busy day is likely in store for you! Even if you have the day off from your career, you can expect some important task to come calling as curious Mercury in your 6th House of Work and Service syncs up with rebellious Uranus in your 10th House of Professional Goals and Responsibilities. While Uranus always brings surprises in his wake, this time the energy is positive and so the surprises should be so as well! Still, you'd be wise to prepare for anything.","The universe is offering you a fabulous opportunity to enjoy yourself today! Witty Mercury in your passionate 5th House of Creativity along with unique Uranus in your expansive 9th House of Distant Places are coming together for a rare trine, giving you plenty of things to explore and many ways to indulge yourself. Take time to experience life in a way that works for you, but don't forget to try something new along the way! Let the world open up to you.","The stars are telling you to hang up the do not disturb sign and let yourself unwind! Speedy Mercury in your domestic sector is bringing a lot of energy to your home, but the gentle angle he makes to Uranus can help you step back and take some time for yourself, regardless of what a family member or roommate might want. Draw a friendly line in the sand and let people know you'll get back to them under more social skies in the future.","People may bring some very interesting information your way today. It could be from a specific person who already plays a pivotal role in your life -- so don't expect this to come from any stranger on the street! Quick-witted Mercury in your communications sector forms a charming angle with innovative Uranus, currently on an extended tour of your partnership sector. This is prime time for a serendipitous moment, so be sure to get out there and take advantage of it.","You've probably had money on your mind ever since intelligent Mercury floated into your 2nd House of Earned Income and Material Matters. Today, the cosmic communicator amiably aligns with revolutionary Uranus in your daily work sector, which could bring a very surprising opportunity into your professional life. Anything could happen now! A new client with a lot of money to spend might show up, or you may come up with a great idea that could even earn you a raise. Think big!","Countless ideas may spin through your mind as cerebral Mercury, the planet of communication, spins through your sign. When he makes a magical connection with radical Uranus in your sector of passion and creativity, it'll be the perfect time to express yourself without reservation. If you're already involved in the arts then feel free to do something that showcases your talents, but skill doesn't matter right now. As long as you're doing things your way, you can have fun doing anything.","Things are getting shaken up on your home front at the moment, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. Mercurial Mercury in your 12th House of the Subconscious nudges unconventional Uranus in your 4th House of Emotions and Family, making this a surprisingly wonderful time for easy self-expression and healing work. If there is anyone -- particularly a family member -- that you've been butting heads with, today could offer you the chance to clear the air and shed old baggage without stress.","Altruism greatly influences today. Even if you don't believe in karma, the stars are offering you the chance to radiate happiness into the world around you. With winter holidays just around the corner, this is a great time to donate to a toy or clothing drive, even if you're just getting rid of some old stuff. If that's not an option, try to do something -- whatever you can! -- to help someone else without expecting anything in return. The universe will notice your efforts."
2021-12-21,"Today is one of the most transformative days of the year, as the almighty Sun enters Capricorn for his annual tour, marking the Winter Solstice and the start of a new season. An early opposition between the emotional Moon and pleasure-loving Venus could have us wanting to celebrate the day in a way that brings pleasure into our lives. This theme will only grow when the Moon zips into expansive Leo at 4:54 pm EST, so we're encouraged to do something fun this evening!","The universe wants you to set your sights as high as you possibly can, and for you, that's probably pretty high! You're entering an incredibly auspicious time of year for manifesting your professional goals, so you should do your best to sharpen your focus and make this period really count. VIPs and bosses could be happier than ever to lend you a helping hand -- although you'll likely be so in your element that you won't even need any help. Start climbing!","Something wonderful may be coming your way at this very moment! A boost from the universe could feel like it gives you wings, allowing you to experience freedom once again and start to explore the world, metaphorically or literally, on a level that will satisfy you mentally, physically, and spiritually. Think about anything you've been missing in the great wide yonder and take the steps¬ -- even just early planning -- to begin reaching for those places or doing those activities once again.","Things could seem very intense for a while, like the cosmic thermostat has cranked up the heat. There are opportunities for growth coming your way, but it's probably the kind of growth that creates diamonds -- slow, tense shifts beneath the surface that eventually lead to major change. Creating a few diamonds of your own might not be the most comfortable process, but the universe knows you can do it! Look within to find any necessary personal adjustments, then you can work outwards.","Even if you usually prefer to handle most things on your own, you can't deny that there are times when life is easier with someone there beside you to offer a helping hand or a listening ear. Regardless of who this person is to you, it's OK to accept support from the people in your life -- perhaps even some new people! You might be pleasantly surprised by the way people enjoy helping and by how much a fresh connection could add to your world.","Good things take work, and while you're generally good at staying on top of all matters, even you might have been a little nonchalant about parts of your routine recently. If you've fallen out of any positive habits, be it with your sleep schedule, your diet, or another aspect of your health, then now is a great time to hop right back on the horse and make a point to stay there. You can go far when you put in the effort!","It's time to wake up! If you've been doing some late-season hibernation, you're now being called to get out of bed and start living life to the fullest again. You might have been spending your time dealing with everyone else's issues, but this is a good moment to return to your own personal program and put yourself and your desires front and center. Focus on the things that bring you the most joy in this world -- then you can chase after them without hesitation!","Today you might want to hit the snooze button and lounge around in bed for a while, taking things one step at a time and in whatever direction you prefer. Luckily, it's a good day to putter around the house and work on yourself rather than focusing on others or any major projects. If you do feel the urge to make a difference, make an effort to apply this energy to your home. Some redecorating or small renovations could really freshen things up for you.","The cosmic pace is about to start picking up, so don't be shocked if it seems like things are happening faster and more frequently than they have in a while. Opportunities to connect with people will probably come your way, but you also might be generally busy with lots of little tasks and appointments. You may need to start keeping a planner or scheduled calendar if you don't already, because you could be filling up any blank space very soon.","You're entering an especially lucrative time of year, which probably sounds amazing! Still, you won't get rewarded for doing nothing -- don't hesitate to dig in and get to work. If you've already been putting in the effort at work then it might be time to ask for a raise! That said, if you're starting to feel like you aren't getting the monetary recognition that you deserve, then go ahead and start looking for greener pastures to spend your days.","Pleasantly invigorating energy is being sent to you by the universe, encouraging you to rub the sleep out of your eyes and start showing people what you're all about. If you've been living life in the background or hanging out in the wings, it's time to hop into center stage and command the spotlight! New beginnings are available every day, so don't wait to start making fresh goals for yourself, because you'll likely be able to achieve them with flying colors.","The heat is getting turned down for you, so don't be shocked if you want to spend some time alone and avoid people for a while. You're entering one of the quietest times of the year for you, when the energy is more focused on detoxing old habits so you can make room for new, better ones. Those fresh options may not be here just yet, but you'd be wise to create space for them right now to make sure you don't miss anything.","Change is in the wind today, and it's nudging you to step back and take some time to check in with your loved ones. You might have missed some developments, particularly if you've been busy manifesting professional gains out in the world. Even if nothing special is going on, connecting with others can still bring great happiness. However, chances are high that something big is in the works! Getting your finger on the pulse right now will help you figure out what's going on."
2021-12-22,"Our energy levels are likely to go through many different stages today, as the moody Moon in Leo makes three different potent angles. Things heat up in the morning when she aligns with determined Mars in Sagittarius, boosting us all into the new day. A tough opposition from icy Saturn at 2:28 pm EST could dim our fires, but less than an hour later, Luna will shift into a powerful square with rebellious Uranus, making us see possibilities where there were none before.","This is truly a gold-star day for having fun! The planets are giving you permission to chase after your own desires, so don't worry about listening to what others have to say today. That doesn't mean you can completely ignore everyone, but no matter what, try to take at least some time for yourself. If life has felt a little dull or lacking lately, do whatever you can to bring some joy your way. It's just waiting for you to grab it!","Questions from others, even loved ones, may feel rather invasive at this time. The stars are move through some very personal areas of your chart, like your intimacy and home sectors. As they do, they're reminding you to keep your cards close to your chest! There's nothing wrong with sharing information with interested parties, but if you don't want to talk, then you shouldn't have to. Let people in at your own discretion and take all relationships one step at a time.","Ideas could bubble up in your mind as the temperamental Moon calls to other planets from your communications sector. Normally it might be wiser to sit on concepts until you're absolutely ready to share them with the world, but today it may help you to take some of those half-formed concepts and let people hear them. Someone might have some very useful advice and perhaps be able to identify some of your blind spots! Don't be scared to share your thoughts.","Opportunities -- likely revolving around your work or money -- are waiting for you to claim them! With the inspirational Moon in your grounded money sector, it's a good time to focus on the mundane issues of life, even if they aren't very exciting. If you've been hoping to get a better grip on your finances or career, now is the time. Don't hesitate to begin, because there's probably lots of good work to do! You could be pleasantly surprised by how much you accomplish.","All eyes are on you at the moment -- which probably sounds great to you, Leo! As the excitable Moon shines her spotlight directly on you, you have a chance to take extra advantage of this energy and see how far you can run with it. That said, keep in mind that you don't need to make a spectacle of yourself in order for people to be impressed with you. Just be who you are, and everyone who matters will be sure to remember it.","Your emotions might get the better of you today, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. If it feels like your emotions are all over the place, you can chalk it up to the fact that the melodramatic Moon and fiery Mars are connecting across your emotional sectors. Fortunately, they're slipping into a gorgeous trine, so all those feelings may actually be a good thing, even if they're a little stressful in the moment. There's nothing wrong with a good cry sometimes!","Today might feel like a carnival ride as you try to create some semblance of order in your social life. It may seem as though everyone in your phonebook is hitting you up for one reason or another, so any plans or outstanding chores might have to get pushed to the backburner as you try to get back to everyone. While this might irritate you at first, you could be pleasantly surprised if people bring some important information your way. Listen up!","Thanks to a fabulous alignment between the instinctual Moon and active Mars in your career and money sectors, you could make leaps and bounds at work today! So whether or not you've actually got any projects in front of you, go on and roll up your sleeves to show off your skills. If you're currently looking for employment or hoping to change jobs, a terrific new opportunity could present itself now. There is no professional mountain too high for you to climb!","You're hardly known for being a homebody, Sagittarius, but with the intuitive Moon in your expansion sector, you should try even more than usual to gaze out into the world for new stimulation from distant lands. Whether or not you can travel right now, this is a great time to plan a future trip, searching out intriguing locations that call your name. In the meantime, something as simple as reading up on a topic you've always been curious about could be quite satisfying.","Even positive energy can be a little too much sometimes, and today might be one of those times. Things could feel particularly sensitive, so it may be best to take things one step at a time and check in with yourself along the way. You don't have to push yourself beyond your limits! If an opportunity to try something new pops up, inspect the offer carefully before you actually agree to anything -- even if there isn't a specific reason not to take it.","This is a great day to link up with your friends -- and perhaps meet some new people as well! You've got cosmic clearance to throw yourself into any relationships that come your way, be they platonic, professional, or romantic. While you may be wary of reaching out into the unknown, the planets have got your back today. Your technology sector is also highlighted, so hopping on an app or online might provide you with more connections than you would have anticipated.","You're being encouraged to get an early start today, thanks to the helpful Moon in your 6th House of Health and Wellness making several lively angles to other planets. An opportunity to do something big could emerge when you least expect it -- while it would be nice to have some warning, this opportunity probably won't be giving you a heads-up. Some activities could come out of left field, so put on your game face and show people just how capable you are!"
2021-12-23,"There seems to be little rhyme or reason to today's stars. The muddled Moon will be forming a number of awkward angles, all of which could leave us feeling stuck. The Moon is in Leo, but that buoyant energy gets lost as in a series of quincunxes to some major heavy hitters in the sky, namely mystical Neptune in the morning, creating confusion, then another with alchemical Pluto this evening. Fortunately, a final alignment with compassionate Venus at 7:50 pm EST can soothe our spirits.","There's room for everyone at the table today! That said, whether or not you'll find time to interact with them is another story. You're likely living the good life, thanks to the emotional Moon bounding through your 5th House of Fun and Games, but throughout the day she'll be bumping into several other planets in ways that may have you tripping over lots of separate obligations to different people in your life. Don't expect too much from anyone -- including yourself!","Your home could be the scene of some drama today -- but whether it's real drama or mountains out of molehills is still undecided. The temperamental Moon is in your 4th House of Home and Family, and while she's nesting here she'll make more than one unusual angle to various planets, none of which are really good or bad on their own. If you don't quite know how to interact with people, don't worry! This mixed-up energy should blow away by tomorrow.","Lots of people may be clamoring for your attention at this time! The instinctive Moon is spinning through rambunctious Leo and your outgoing 3rd House of Local Community and Communications, so this could be quite the busy day. Unfortunately, thanks to Luna stumbling into rough angles with three other planets, you might not be able to find time to get it all done. Consider making a game plan as soon as possible -- it'll help you stay organized and weather any storm.","Financial matters might be especially confusing today. You might want to keep a closer eye than usual on your money, particularly while the sensitive Moon in your 2nd House of Earned Income makes unusual aspects with various other intense planets. You might be enticed to throw your cash around one minute but then try to invest in a safe rainy-day fund the next. Either way, be careful of money matters that sound too good to be true -- they most likely are.","It may be difficult to recognize yourself in a mirror right now, no matter how well you normally know yourself. The flighty Moon in your sign rubs three other planets the wrong way, creating some odd feelings that could leave you scratching your head when it comes to understanding what exactly you're supposed to do with yourself. Allow your natural confidence to shine through and don't let a momentary lack of clarity throw you for a loop. Tomorrow should make more sense!","A brand new path is opening up ahead of you -- it could have a very good destination, but you may have to move very slowly to avoid tripping yourself up as you travel it. The sensitive Moon remains in your 12th House of Fantasy, but she's getting caught up in multiple offbeat alignments, possibly causing the landscape to change without warning. There's no need to push anything right now -- just trust the process and don't expect too much from yourself.","No matter how fun hanging out is, there's more to good friendships than simply getting together in the same place. The fickle Moon in your community sector runs up against several other planets throughout the day, creating some frustrating energy that could make it difficult for you to get on the same page with anyone else. Some unexpected events could occur, causing even more uncertainty about your future with a certain group, but try not to let one day impact your futures together too much.","Career matters are front and center today -- at least until the planets shove them off to one side, and then the other, then right back in your face! As the indecisive Moon in your professional sector performs a few strange steps with various other planets, she'll be making it irritatingly difficult to know what you're supposed to be achieving -- let alone how to do it. Take everything with a grain of salt, especially if it comes from a boss or VIP.","Expansive skies stretch out in front of you at this time, thanks to the thoughtful Moon moving through your 9th House of Higher Learning and Boundless Horizons. Unfortunately, it may be more difficult than it seems to actually discover anything useful. Luna shifts into questionable alignments three separate times -- none of them are exactly bad, but they aren't good, either. Today could end with you feeling stretched rather thin. Move at your own pace, getting where you need to be in good time.","Life may feel like crossing a tightrope at the moment, but if you keep your wits about you, then there's no reason you can't make it through. The dizzy Moon spins through your intense 8th House of Soul-Merging and Shared Resources, making a series of uncomfortable alignments to stubborn Venus, elusive Neptune, and powerful Pluto. You could feel pulled in many directions that all feel equally important. As long as you stay as balanced as you can, you should be able to keep moving.","People could play an important role in your life today, although the planets are going to make it difficult for you to ascertain whether this role is helpful or downright harmful. There is a veritable spiderweb forming throughout the sky, beginning directly in your partnership zone, so someone you feel like you know well and consider an equal could really throw you for a loop. Don't let today impact your views of them too much! Any confusion should pass by tomorrow.","Life might feel out of sync today, as though your responsibilities keep slipping through your fingers no matter how tightly you try to hold onto them. The fussy Moon in your routine sector is acting up like a child in need of a nap, making it entirely too easy to fall behind on one thing while trying to accomplish another. Don't worry about being on top of your game right now -- it's OK to put off anything that doesn't require immediate attention."
2021-12-24,"Anything could happen today, but it might bring major repercussions our way. Stoic Saturn in Aquarius makes a rare square with rebellious Uranus, stirring the pot and giving us some growing pains in the process. Fortunately, the emotional Moon will enter clear-sighted Virgo early this morning, making it easier for us to deal with any last-minute problems. We should listen to the prudent encouragement of the Moon trine the responsible Capricorn Sun at 9:05 am EST and try to carry this energy throughout the day.","It's important not to leave people hanging, but that can be rather difficult when work comes calling and demands your attention -- whether you're ready or not. A tough and very rare square between rational Saturn in your social sector and revolutionary Uranus in your financial sector could pull you in two separate directions. You might not even see any potential problem coming until it's staring you in the face. Be honest about your needs to avoid anyone's feelings getting hurt.","An unfamiliar, tense energy could cause friction at this time, due to karmic Saturn in your career sector making a rare and harsh square with risky Uranus, directly in your sign, Taurus. If you've been feeling pressured lately, be sure to take some time to yourself. You could crack when least expected with a reaction that's larger than life! If you feel a meltdown coming, make an effort to vent privately as opposed to somewhere a person you want to impress might witness it.","Today might be the kind of day when it feels like you have almost no control over any aspect of your life, which is hardly a pleasant thing. A very unusual square involving authoritative Saturn in your expansion sector and iconoclast Uranus in your subconscious realm is going to make it almost impossible for you to figure out which way you're going! Your peers might push you along despite your protests. Even if it's not easy, do your best to set limits for yourself.","You may feel like the rope in a cosmic game of tug-o-war today, as levelheaded Saturn in your privacy sector squares off against unreasonable Uranus in your 11th House of Social Groups and Global Communications. Even if you'd prefer to be alone, it's entirely possible that way too many people will ignore your attempts to withdraw and instead bang on your door and demand your attention. You're going to have to assert some boundaries, but deciding where exactly they go is up to you.","People and professional matters are going to be front and center today, but trying to figure out which to deal with first won't be simple. Thanks to a rare yet exceptionally complicated square between strict Saturn in your relationship sector and attention-grabbing Uranus in your career sector, you could wind up feeling stretched very thin! A loved one may not be thrilled about how much time you're dedicating to work. Make your position clear, especially if you don't have a lot of control over it.","A wonderful opportunity for you to get out and explore the world might emerge from out of the blue. Normally this should be a positive thing, but this time icy Saturn in your daily work sector tumbles into a rough square with impossible Neptune and demands that you take care of some things you may have been putting off. Any exciting plans might have to wait for you to get some stuff done -- you can chill out once you've checked any necessary boxes.","Opening up to others may be difficult at the moment, even if it feels like what the universe wants you to do. Fair Saturn in your creativity sector is asking you to show up for yourself, but thanks to a complicated square with unruly Uranus in your privacy sector, you might feel like hiding away from people and tending to your own needs. It's OK to be on your own for now, but Saturn wants you to step up sooner rather than later.","People could bring some very unexpected moments your way very soon. While you might normally be open to this, today the attention could be anything but desirable! Reactive Uranus in your partnership zone is forming a harsh square with disciplined Saturn in your emotional sector, so don't be shocked if your buttons seem more exposed than usual. It may feel like your friends can't help but push them. If you find you're in no mood for anyone's guff, feel free to take a personal day.","You're likely to be very busy today! Structured Saturn in your 3rd house of Multi-Tasking is demanding action by sending you lots of little things to deal with, but in contrast, unstable Uranus in your 6th House of Work and Service is commanding you to focus on more serious matters and leave casual tasks for another day. No matter how confusing things feel, being judicious about how you spend your time and can let you make it through this complicated alignment with flying colors.","Some exciting options might appear on your plate today -- especially in comparison to the more measured opportunities you may have encountered lately as dutiful Saturn has been spinning through your financial sector and forcing you to get serious about your finances. Today, Saturn shoves against unconventional Uranus in your entertainment sector, offering you tons of fun in the process! If you can postpone work then go for it, but don't leave necessary things for too long, or Saturn could reprimand your procrastination.","You aren't exactly known for being the most emotional sign, Aquarius -- whether or not you're usually like that, there isn't anything necessarily wrong with it. Right now, however, any hard-minded behavior might rub someone else the wrong way. A family member or close friend could require a bit of TLC. Suppress any urges to offer constructive criticism rather than support and make an effort to approach them with an open heart and mind. A show of toughness is likely the last thing they need.","You could surprise even yourself today, due to quirky Uranus acting up in your 3rd House of Communication. Uranus jarringly squares solemn Saturn in your subconscious realm, so some things might pop out of your mouth that you've been trying to keep other people from hearing. Think of yourself like the cork in a bottle: if you're careful there won't be any spillage, but a few careless actions might create a mess that could affect other people as well as yourself. Watch out!"
2021-12-25,"Pleasure and satisfaction take on a whole new importance as luxe Venus forms her yearly conjunction with potent Pluto in Capricorn, intensifying all our deepest desires. It should be easier than ever to speak our feelings and manifest them into something real and useful when the lovely Virgo Moon trines Mercury, also in Capricorn, at 3:08 pm EST to bring us clarity. Even so, we might still have to rub some fog from our eyes when the Moon opposes mystical Neptune in the evening.","Major transformations could occur today, impacting how people see you and what they believe you're capable of. Thanks to a powerful alignment between precious Venus and high-powered Pluto in your 10th House of Career and Achievements, you might be offered the opportunity to make a name for yourself -- the sort of name that people may remember and deeply appreciate! An authority figure or other VIP could decide you deserve a reward such as a hefty end-of-year bonus, and you've likely earned it!","The world has something truly special to offer you today, as your ruler, pleasure-loving Venus, is coming together for a once-a-year alignment with transformative Pluto. Both of these planets are camped out in your 9th House of Expansion and Foreign Cultures at the moment, encouraging you to open your mind. A lovely opportunity to widen your world could come from far, far away, so be sure to accept any enticing invitations that you may receive -- the rewards might be quite wonderful!","The planets could bring a gorgeous opportunity to your doorstep at any moment, so get ready to sit back and let their rewards rain down on you.

Amorous Venus and intimate Pluto are merging their energies in a once-a-year conjunction in your 7th House of Partnerships, putting the focus on your loved ones. Someone special could bring a truly game-changing opportunity your way or offer you a gift that's more than you could have ever dreamed of. There's a lot to be thankful for -- possibly from one person in particular!","Something major may be falling into your lap when it comes to work and professional matters, Leo! Delightful Venus is coming together with alchemical Pluto in your 6th House of Work and Routine, opening a window of opportunity to really earn your worth -- and perhaps a little extra while you're at it. Regardless, it won't hurt to try! The same sector also deals with your health, so this might be a good time to schedule a check-up or initiate a new exercise regime.","This could be one of the most memorable days you've had in quite some time! Thanks to a rare conjunction between rich Venus and deep-thinking Pluto in your sector of passion and creativity, you're being offered an amazing chance to show everyone what you are all about. If you're an artistic type, this could be the perfect day to share your work with the world. Even if you aren't, your work might still be noticed by someone very important who can help widen your audience.","Potent possibilities currently simmer within your home. Venus, your ruler and the planet of love and beauty, is coming into a conjunction with powerful Pluto that only happens once a year. Under such a unique combination, a family member or roommate could surprise you with a really wonderful gift or opportunity! You never know when someone will change everything in a truly gorgeous way. It's also a terrific time to host people at your place, so open up your doors to those you love.","Interesting things can be found around every corner today -- you should keep your eyes and ears open, because you'll want to be ready to respond to anything. Valuable Venus and exceptional Pluto are syncing up to make a rare conjunction at the same degree in your 3rd House of Local Community and Communication. Look for something fun happening in your neighborhood, such as an art gallery or music event, because the most magical things can happen nearer than you might think!","An almost literal golden opportunity could arrive at your door, thanks to the stunning alignments shining overhead. Venus, the planet of money, is forming an intriguing conjunction with extreme Pluto in your 2nd House of Earned Income and Material Security. If you've been working a lot recently, then you could finally begin reaping a big reward for all that you've sowed -- or the opportunity to start earning even more may come your way. Receiving a last-minute gift is also a possibility!","People will have a hard time missing the inviting energy you could radiate today, so don't be shocked if they stare! Venus, the goddess of beauty, is aligning with magnetic Pluto in your 1st House of Self-Expression, giving you an incredibly powerful allure. This is a great time to experiment with your appearance, but remember that with Venus currently retrograde, you would be wise to hold off on any major or permanent transformations, like tattoos or total makeovers. Look for some fun temporary changes instead.","There's something mysterious brewing overhead that could leave you feeling like you're floating through a fantasy land. Indulgent Venus is forming her annual conjunction with deep Pluto in your dreamy 12th House of the Subconscious. This realm rules all the unseen aspects of your life, so something could occur quite literally out of the blue that has a deep impact on you. Luckily, Venus wants you to find some happiness in it, so there's no need to fear. Let yourself live and grow peacefully!","Hanging out with friends could bring even more joy than usual, thanks to the bountiful energy lighting up today. It's a terrific time to get together and catch up with the people you love, particularly when darling Venus dances into alignment with exceptional Pluto in your 11th House of Social Groups. Try to link up with friends early in the day and take in any local festivities. Don't hide away and miss out on the fun, because days like this are too rare!"
2021-12-26,"There's no need to rush through today, thanks to the gentle Moon entering sociable Libra this morning. Our conversations could take on an inspired glow as clever Mercury in Capricorn makes a pleasant sextile with dreamy Neptune in Pisces at 4:29 pm EST, making it a perfect time to take things at our own, easy pace.

Thanks to their connection, today could bring you an especially broadening conversation with someone you value, making this the perfect time to speak openly. An honest conversation could see a partnership -- in business or in your personal life -- taken to the next level.","You've probably been kept busy by plucky Mercury buzzing through your 6th House of Work and Routine, upping the level of frenetic energy as you try and get everything done. Today, however, could offer you the chance to use all this to your advantage as Mercury comes into contact with healing Neptune in your 8th House of Big Money.

That mood may be lightened by Mercury forming a friendly alignment with easy-going Neptune, so you don't need to put in so much effort that you burn out.

With those two in your corner, you'd be wise to give voice to any ideas that come your way. Their cosmic source could make them both unique and useful! Even if you normally prefer to play things by the book, it's okay to let yourself color and speak outside of the traditional lines for now.","A potential windfall is coming your way, but you may not have a good view of any specifics until the opportunity arrives.

2021-12-27,"We’re being asked to consider ourselves in tandem with the people in our lives as the considerate Moon moves through relationship-oriented Libra. Early risers will get an extra jolt of energy to make the day theirs as the Moon sextiles energetic Mars in Sagittarius, reminding us all that the world truly is our oyster!

Saturn can help you use this to your financial advantage, so don't look a gift horse in the mouth.","People could play an important role in your life under the current stars.

A fated event that requires you to step up and prove yourself could occur when you're just hanging out, so be ready.","There are achievements to be made and work to be done today, but you should have some support when you least expect it. Dynamic Mars is in your 10th House of Goals, and once he sextiles structured Saturn in your subconscious sector, an unknown helper might decide that it's time to help you with your ascent up a metaphorical mountain. Know that your efforts will pay off eventually and if you start to feel overwhelmed, just remind yourself that you are not alone!"
2021-12-30,"Our words take on a rather sharp edge today as eloquent Mercury aligns with all-or-nothing Pluto at 4:54 am EST. This theme will carry through the day and be amplified when the temperamental Moon in Scorpio forms a number of angles, notably including a helpful sextile to potent Pluto late this morning, bringing on even more deep feelings. The mood could dramatically change when the Moon enters Sagittarius in the early evening, giving us the chance to shake any heaviness off.","Remaining in a professional frame of mind, even if you don't have any real work in front of you, is a good idea today. Mental Mercury is coming together with alchemical Pluto for a rare conjunction in your 10th House of Achievements and Career Goals, making it easy for you to pick out the proper path and follow it to a pot of gold. Just try to not run anyone over in your race to the finish! Pluto can encourage rash behavior, so be considerate.","You've got a bird's eye view of the world today, thanks to a special alignment between messenger Mercury and transformative Pluto as they meet up in your 9th House of Global Expansion and Spirituality. A very poignant or powerful message could come your way -- this might completely alter how you perceive the world around you. Your sign is known to be somewhat stubborn, but try to give your opinions room to evolve as the universe ushers them along to the next stage.","Today you could feel like a detective trying to unravel a tangled web. Your ruler, clever Mercury, conjuncts powerful Pluto in your 8th House of Secrets and Shared Resources, so if there are any complicated matters in your life, this might be the perfect day to tackle them. You'll likely be more adept than usual at handling subjects like that. If issues regarding ownership of something do pop up, stand up for yourself -- just not at the expense of someone you care about.","Don't be shocked if someone says or does something that has a big impact on your day today. Picky Mercury is conjuncting power-player Pluto in your 7th House of Relationships, so someone you consider an equal or partner could decide to rock the boat. It should be alright if you're on the same page about the matter, but if not, it could create some friction for you. Keep an open mind, but don't be a doormat! Speak up if you're being treated unfairly.","It's a good day to get serious about life and how you live it. Mercury, the cosmic communicator, is making its once-a-year conjunction to serious Pluto in your 6th House of Health and Daily Routine. If you've been putting your wellness on the back burner, you could receive a sharp reminder that this sort of thing has consequences -- you can't let things slide indefinitely! For those already in tip-top shape, you can start planning how you want to improve even more in 2022.","The planets are offering you the chance to show off today, but it's important you don't get carried away in the process. Your ruler, intelligent Mercury, is forming a potent alignment with all-or-nothing Pluto in your passionate 5th House of Creativity and True Love. You might feel the need to put yourself front and center, even if other people aren't quite giving you the space to do so. It's fine to get your fifteen minutes, but don't try and make the whole day about you.","Family relations might be a bit extreme at the moment, thanks to a combustible aspect occurring in your home sector. A rare conjunction between fussy Mercury and particular Pluto in your foundational sector could make it impossible for you to see eye-to-eye with someone who shares your living space -- or perhaps your DNA. It's one thing to make your point heard, but watch out for losing your temper in the process. Something said right now could have quite long-lasting repercussions.","Conversations take on a very serious tone under today's planets, as witty Mercury and intense Pluto come together for a potent conjunction in your 3rd House of Ideas and Communications. This aspect could make your tongue razor sharp! While it's good to say your piece and hold your ground, be careful you aren't so forceful that it hurts anyone's feelings.

Smart Mercury is forming a once-a-year conjunction with deep Pluto in your 2nd House of Earned Income and Material Possessions, and they may have you eagerly defending what you see as rightfully yours.

Communicator Mercury is currently spinning through your sign and giving you lots to say, but today he'll conjunct opinionated Pluto. These two planets aren't too concerned with mincing words or sparing feelings! It's alright to be honest, but not if it means being unnecessarily rude or harsh. If someone hasn't asked for constructive criticism, then you probably don't need to supply it.","It's important to not force yourself in any one particular direction today, because there's a good chance that you're not going to have a perfect understanding of what's actually going on. Flighty Mercury and dark Pluto are coming together in your subconscious realm -- even if they want to help, they'll likely just make it difficult to actually know what you're talking about. Reserve any judgments for another day with less confusing stars, as it's too easy to miss the mark right now.","Issues in group dynamics could get blown out of all sense of proportion today, thanks to a harsh angle between fickle Mercury and severe Pluto in your 11th House of Social Networks and Global Communications. Someone, or perhaps quite a few people, might decide to assert their position -- which may leave you and everyone else feeling like no one can get a word in edgewise. Try to make sure you aren't this person and that you're helping make equal space for everyone."
2021-12-31,"The graceful Moon spends the day moving through free-spirited Sagittarius, helping us see the broader picture rather than focusing on the nitty-gritty details. In the early afternoon, the Moon will reach out and sextile to sober Saturn in Aquarius, helping us transform our energy into something productive. A later conjunction between Luna and red-hot Mars at 3:01 pm EST will give us an extra jolt to carry any projects over the finish line.

You shouldn't sit back and wait for opportunities to appear -- instead, search them out as best you can.","Life might feel like a tight-rope walk today, but there isn't any reason you can't manage it along with the best acrobats. The temperamental Moon and aggressive Mars are aligning in your 8th House of Intensity, and this energy is going to impact you on a very deep level that can make things appear more dramatic than they actually are. Keep calm if a conflicting situation comes your way! You should be able to walk whatever line you please as long as you stay cool.","Someone you know could unexpectedly bring some very tempting and exciting times your way. You probably think of this person as an equal or even a partner, be it a lover, friend, or simply a co-worker. The intuitive Moon and bold warrior Mars are syncing up in your 7th House of Relationships, so you could wind up getting your buttons pushed no matter how much you'd prefer to keep things copacetic. Try to give everyone -- even yourself -- some leeway today.","Excess energy could fill your mind at the moment, so it isn't your imagination if you wake up with the urge to let loose in one way or another. The domestic Moon and vigorous Mars are meeting up in your wellness sector, so make a point to get in a good workout. You can use whatever drive is left over to do some organizing, whether that's just doing the laundry or planning bigger goals. Clean up your act -- you'll be glad you did!","Tons of fun is on the table today -- at least, it is as long as you don't hide yourself away and refuse this wonderful opportunity. The friendly Moon and enthusiastic Mars are coming together to encourage you to express yourself in very sincere and passionate ways. Don't hesitate to be truly yourself without fear or any sense of trepidation! Whether you want to literally put on a show or just spend some time dancing or having fun in your room, let your creativity shine.","Something could be coming up from deep under the surface, possibly inciting you to move at a breakneck pace to try and keep up with it. That said, you may not actually get that far. The emotional Moon conjuncts stubborn Mars in your home sector, so you're probably going to be spinning in circles within your own four walls. Powerful energies can make it seem like there's is hardly enough space for you, wherever you might look. Make some space for yourself as necessary!","Your tongue might be a little sharper than usual, thanks to the perceptive Moon syncing up with warrior Mars in your communications sector. Today is a good day to watch your words! You don't have to keep quiet or avoid people -- if anything, conversations with others are encouraged. Reaching out and connecting could feel wonderfully electric. Just make sure you don't send so much electricity that it shocks anyone. Remember that there's a big difference between sharing information and talking over someone.","The stars are lighting a fire in your engine -- and in your wallet! The pensive Moon and tenacious Mars conjunct in your 2nd House of Income this afternoon to create some powerful energy. If you're looking for a fresh opportunity to increase your earnings, now is the perfect time to start searching for something that will be a wonderful fit for you. A raise -- or even a whole new job -- could be yours if you gather your courage and make an effort.","Don't be surprised if you feel like you've downed a couple of energy drinks today! This afternoon, the instinctive Moon will conjunct action planet Mars directly in your sign, so your energy levels might go through the roof as these planets push you forward with lots of power. You could probably move mountains if you tried! Get out there and seize the day, because the last thing the universe wants you to do right now is limit yourself in any way.","You might be a little easily stymied at this time, despite your best efforts. The sensitive Moon is forming a potent conjunction with heated Mars in your subconscious sector, which may leave you feeling like you're all dressed up with nowhere to go. No matter how hard you try to move forward, you'll likely end up feeling like you're stuck running in place. Instead, take a step back and let the universe control your pace. You could travel much further if you don't push.","People may have a lot to say at the moment, for better or for worse. If you don't want to hear any guff from the peanut gallery, it's OK to take a step back from communication. There also might be some tense feelings in your social sector as the flighty Moon conjuncts fierce Mars, but it's only temporary! You should be able to get back to people in a day or two -- for now, it might be best to fly solo.","The stars are their best to uplift you today -- you might not even need to expend a lot of effort to take advantage of their help and make good progress toward your goals. The road in front of you is clearing up, thanks to a powerful conjunction between the helpful Moon and determined Mars, so take advantage of the moment and propel yourself forward. An authority figure could help you along this path to success, so accept any helping hands along the way!"
2022-01-01,"Staying up late to ring in the New Year could leave us feeling rather emotional. The sensitive Moon in celebratory Sagittarius begins New Year's Day when it squares sentimental Neptune. However, once we get going, we can also pursue innovative resolutions when the assertive Sun harmoniously trines with revolutionary Uranus at 4:50 am EST. Later in the day, the Moon in serious Capricorn makes a productive sextile with energetic Jupiter, helping us identify practical first steps to build on the empowering vibe of our fresh start.","Your mind is likely on big things now as you might be considering whether or not your career path is in line with what you really value in life. Before you impulsively resolve to find new employment this year, consider that the best way to advocate for an important cause is not always the most direct way. You might be able to accomplish more than you think working behind the scenes in your current situation, so take some time today to plan a subtler approach.","Checking in with a longtime spiritual or political commitment of yours could make it obvious that you've grown and changed a lot over the past few years, to a point where you may wonder if you still fit where you've always belonged. While the awkwardness of the encounter could surprise you, your friends may still be able to guide you through it. They can either suggest a way that the dots still connect or help you find a new community that fits you better now.","Trying to figure out your purpose and direction in life could be compelling for you today, but you may sense that you are held back by something outside of your view. Digging into the mystery will probably be worthwhile! Though you may have avoided this task in the past because it seemed difficult, you're currently well positioned to make some surprising discoveries. A good place to start might be asking an older member of your family about something you've always wanted to know.","Getting to know some of your acquaintances better as individuals, particularly people you usually see in big group settings, could be a worthy goal for you this year. Someone like that might turn into a very intellectually stimulating connection, even if the environment where you usually connect with them has a completely different vibe. Try asking around to see if any acquaintances have read any good books or articles lately, and listen carefully to the answers you get. Don't be afraid to start a dialogue!","Reflecting on how you've grown professionally over the past few years could be inspiring for you today, but looking at whether your daily routines have caught up to any big, visible changes in your life can instead show you things you need to improve going forward. At first, building habits that work better for you might require you to clarify your boundaries with others whose routines are intertwined with yours. While you may fear disturbing the peace, more defined goals could ultimately help them too.","Learning some new techniques could help you get more pleasure out of a hobby or pastime that's important to you. You may have resisted this step in the past, on the grounds that letting someone else influence you might throw off your groove of doing your own things in your own way. However, if you can identify something that's necessary to learn so you can move onward, you may be able to find a new teacher who's a good fit for you right now.","There may be some big issues surrounding the financial side of your home or family life that you need to deal with soon, and the hardest part could be deciding where to start such an overwhelming task! Today, at least, you can try to begin sketching out a plan. Don't let yourself lose sight of the forest for the tree -- do your best to identify any details that really matter right now, and leave the less urgent issues for later.","Improving your relationships might be a goal for you at this time, and you may be thinking about increasing your flow of conversation with someone significant to you. While that is admirable, be wary of jumping headfirst into heavy topics. The best way to build intimacy at this point might just be having fun together! What makes each person laugh and smile can be unique to them as an individual, so you can learn a lot about your loved ones that way.","You may have an eye for what needs to improve in your financial life today. Whatever you plan to do about it, approaching the situation from a place where you feel secure should help you make better decisions. Even if it's easiest to see what you're lacking, there has to be at least one thing, however small, that's going well for you now! Focusing on any positives you find can help you trust that a good outcome for other issues is similarly possible.","Respecting yourself will help you know where the correct communication limits are. If you want people to know the real you, opening up more in your conversations could help. However, it can be hard to strike the right balance between holding all the way back and totally spilling your guts! While you may be tempted to start by dropping your boundaries so much that you blurt out embarrassing secrets, do your best to stay focused on some of your qualities that you're genuinely confident about.","You may feel worn out rest at this time, but the answer to your fatigue is not necessarily snuggling into your bed and sleeping. Instead, it might be putting yourself in an environment where you can openly express any hidden parts of yourself. You could be surprised by how vigorous you feel when you free up the energy you formerly used to hold things back. Though you may have to spend money to get the space you need, the investment could be well worth it!","New friends could be attracted to your good nature today, so enjoy any unexpected conversations you may have with acquaintances and strangers today. You're likely presenting yourself quite well at this time, which can draw people to you seemingly out of nowhere. To keep them with you for a while, work to maintain a healthy give and take in any communication between the two of you. You can learn a lot from these random encounters, and you might also have the insight someone else needs."
2022-01-02,"We can appreciate what has gotten us this far while we also figure out how to make it better! The empowering New Moon in Capricorn at 1:33 pm EST may draw our attention to the structures of our lives today. While we might already have a fair amount to be proud of, the Moon's harmonious trine to innovative Uranus can help us make needed changes smoothly. Intellectual Mercury also moves into idealistic Aquarius today and gives us a fresh view of the big picture.","Finding direction in your life can be challenging, but you don't have to do it alone. As networker Mercury enters your 11th House of Friendships and Community today, you may be able to form connections with other people whose journeys are similar enough to your own that you can encourage each other from your similar paths. If you experience shifts in your values during this time, though, make sure that you're clear with yourself and others on the difference between peer support and peer pressure.","Reading a longtime favorite writer -- or discovering a new one -- may be quite inspiring for you today, as they could truly put your feelings into words. This can be useful as you think about how to make your mark on the world. While you may be embracing your unique talents more these days, you still need connection with others. Seeing that someone else, even if you don't know them personally, has dealt with similar challenges can help you feel less alone.","An unexpected solution may help you find relief for a stressful financial problem involving something complicated like debt, taxes, or insurance. While very complex bureaucracy, like technology, can sometimes resemble magic, you might want to take this opportunity to learn more about the underlying logic of the system that you're dealing with. It may turn out to be less intimidating than you expect! Today's success can be even more rewarding if you emerge knowing how to reliably repeat it going forward.","Emotional intimacy in any partnership requires breathing room as much as it does close nurturing of each other -- which may be challenging for your caring nature, Cancer. A close relationship of yours may break out of a rut when you spend time with that person in a group setting, seeing a side of them that may differ from when it's just the two of you. As inquisitive Mercury enters your 8th House of Deep Sharing today, give others space to show you something new!","You may currently be eager to change your routine to try and get things done more efficiently. However, you don't necessarily have to reinvent the wheel! While it might be hard for you to take advice from others on this topic, as you could feel like you're being bossed around, shifting your attitude toward authority may get you some really helpful guidance. Even powerful executives use consultants, so you can seek out assistance and know that it doesn't make you any less powerful!","Engaging deeply with the physical world might bring you joy today. Let your analytical nature shine and don't be afraid to try and articulate the details of why you like your current situation. Don't be afraid that digging too much will spoil the magic, because knowing why you like what you like can help you make a coherent plan to get more of it! That way, you don't have to wait for happiness to come to you in the future.","Your home or family life could be due for some changes, and you might have to think outside the box to accomplish your goals in this area. While collaborating with others in an innovative way could work very well for you right now, be sure not to lose track of yourself in whatever arrangement you create. Your sign is known for loving cool ideas, but the hard part is making sure those ideas actually meet everyone's -- including your own -- individual needs in reality.","A close relationship of yours may have been changing for a while, but today, you and the other person might be able to put into words exactly what has shifted. This could be a relief for you, Scorpio, as your sign has a reputation for powerful intuition, so you probably knew something was up. You may not always need the validation of being told that your spidey senses were right, but having someone else on board with you can make you feel less alone.","There's no shame in seeking advice when you know you're in over your head! That said, even if you realize that you need some support to get your finances in order today, you might not even know who to ask. Fortunately, someone in your daily life who you might take for granted may be able to either refer you to a professional or give you enough pointers that you can move forward on your own. Don't be afraid to ask for help!","Changing your image to become a little more relaxed could be scary for you, but you're probably just the right person to perfect the art of taking risks in moderation, Capricorn, as you're known for having that moderation part down! Being open about your personal journey could be a helpful example to others. Having a sense for your own security is still important, but you might now be able to identify situations where being free with some things actually makes you more secure.","Sharing your perspective may get easier for you as communicator Mercury enters your sign. Meanwhile, the New Moon in your 12th House of Secrets could give you some spicy content to talk about! If you might turn your attention to topics typically avoided by the people around you because going there would disrupt their feelings of security, today they may be more open than usual to the challenge. If you're willing to be the point person on any issues, moving forward could be possible.","Your commitment to a community of yours could be up for review at this time. If you've been in the group a long time and find yourself growing tired of it, you may need to look at your deeper motivations for staying involved. You could find your connection rejuvenated, but if you realize that you're unlikely to get what you want by continuing on this same track, you may also develop the confidence you need to finally let go and pursue something else."
2022-01-03,"We may feel justified in manipulating others today. The emotional Moon could be to blame, as it unites with sensuous Venus and calculating Pluto, all in serious Capricorn. While acknowledging the pressures that could push us to such ideas is important right now, we should take care to avoid reacting in ways that could create bigger problems in the future. After the Moon enters Aquarius, she meets with clever Mercury at 9:37 pm EST, which may help us resolve our conflicts openly rather than covertly.","You could have some misgivings about the way money is handled in your relationship with a significant authority figure, like a boss or parent, at this time. Friends or even acquaintances may be able to give you a helpful outside perspective on whether or not the dynamic you are involved with is healthy. Staying the course might still be the least bad option available to you now, but at least knowing how it appears to others can help you decide your next steps.","Having strong basic beliefs about the way the world works is probably necessary for navigating life, but today you may need to carefully make sure that your beliefs help you rather than control you. Ideas imposed on you by an authority figure are particularly likely to be destructive for you at this time, especially if you feel like you must suppress any questions you have. Becoming more comfortable with your own power may be what it takes to help you clean up your mental space.","You may see a way to get ahead in a situation where you share money with others. It might be quite tempting to try and obtain more than your fair share of available resources or to use money to control someone else. Your motivation could genuine, such as a deep longing for security, but try to set that aside long enough to consider your actions objectively. Make sure that you're living up to your own beliefs about how people should treat each other!","Anxiety could currently be your enemy in a close relationship. You might feel tempted to cling tightly to someone, but this runs the risk of pushing them away. Talking to them directly may help relieve your concerns -- though holding back or otherwise trying to manipulate the conversation in a particular direction could backfire on you, so try to be honest. Saying what's on your mind, even if you think it sounds silly, is more likely to get you an honestly positive answer in response.","Perfectionism may paralyze your approach to practical tasks today. Try to separate necessary things from inconsequential details that you might be obsessing over because of a lack of control over something else in your life. You might want to handle that other issue first! If there is someone you have a problem with, you may be better off talking to them directly. Even if you still don't entirely agree with them, at least making an effort to handle things rationally could relieve some tension.","Feeling insecure could tempt you to take a financial risk, as you might imagine something on the scale of winning the lottery is the only way out of your problems. While you can actually accomplish more than you might think through practical work at this time, you may also have a secret longing to be taken care of. Acknowledging this desire could be much healthier than trying to suppress it! Be honest about what you want, but be realistic about what's likely to happen.","Maintaining stability in your home life might be a priority for you, but you could find yourself aware of its price today. While security is important, you should be careful about what you sacrifice to get it. Any arrangement that doesn't allow you some space to express your own individuality probably isn't sustainable in the long run. Pushing for breathing room might seem inconvenient, but taking time to acknowledge the reality of your needs right now can prevent bigger problems later.","Sweet-talking people may get you what you want right now, but promising things you can't deliver in exchange could backfire on you later. You might be wiser to ask directly for what you want rather than trying to manipulate anyone else into giving it to you. Though committing to the truth may scare you because it can take away the security of being able to manage the conversation exactly the way you want, others will probably respect you for your honesty.","Shopping could be a risk for you today, as you might let your emotions run away with your wallet! However, you may also have an exceptional eye for quality at this time, as you're likely in tune with both objective standards of beauty and the more unique things that you personally enjoy. Even if it wasn't quite in the budget, you could wind up with a fine investment piece. As long as you have the money, there's no harm in indulging on occasion!","You might seem to have a personal magnetism that draws others to you today. However, though you may be surrounded by people, you could still remain aloof or separate from them. You can be coldly rational about what you value and what you need for security, and you also might see clearly how you can pursue those things. While focusing on your own interests has a necessary place, just make sure the way you go about doing it is fair to everyone else as well.","Keeping a secret about a financial or relationship matter can help you feel secure, as you may want to protect yourself from what others would think if they knew. While you do have a right to privacy, you also need other things in your life that you can be open about and ways in which you can express yourself freely. Today's challenge might be simply acknowledging to yourself that the face you present to the world isn't all there is, and that that's OK!","A friend group or community of yours may demand your attention at this time, and you might start to wonder if they're treating you fairly. Some controlling or manipulative dynamics might become more obvious, especially if you realize that you're relying heavily on these people for your sense of emotional security. It's possible that you get enough benefits out of this connection to make any difficulties worthwhile, but be sure to check in with yourself to see how you really feel about the situation."
2022-01-04,"Surprises may disrupt our plans today! The impulsive Moon could get to us as it jumps into a challenging square with shocking Uranus. However, we may be able to maintain our calm, as the Moon, normally quite emotional, unites with restrained Saturn in intellectual Aquarius at 1:44 pm EST. She then slides into a sextile with active Mars, helping us take thoughtful action to solve our problems. The opportunity to try something new could be good for us -- even if we didn't expect it to happen.","Commitments to your friends or an organization you are involved with could seem to ask a lot from you at this time. While you may consider helping others to be an important part of living out your values, going about it in a way that doesn't leave you with enough resources to take care of yourself isn't sustainable in the long run. Today, you might need to look at the big picture and make a plan that's fair to the needs of everyone involved.","Authority figures may seem cold to you today. You could be tempted to confront them about it, and doing so might actually succeed in shaking things up. That said, be careful what you wish for! Even if changing your boundaries with them is necessary for the long-term greater good, it might be a messy process at first. Their entrenched patterns could have been holding the lid down on some serious tension. Even so, chaos is probably still better than an unsatisfying status quo.","A close relationship of yours -- whether business, friendship, or anything else -- could be at a point where you need to decide how to move forward. You may be tempted to fall back on advice you've read or heard about what is proper for this type of relationship. If part of you seems to resist this guidance, though, listen to that! Coming up with your own creative solution can feel risky, but you're likely more capable of it than you think.","You may feel like you're doing all the work in a situation involving shared resources. Even if you think this is unfair, you also might not see any other way the resources in question could be handled. Getting an outside perspective on it from friends or even a favorite advice column or blog could be helpful for you! They might just confirm your suspicions that there's no easy answer, but hearing it from someone else can at least make you feel less alone.","A relationship that's a lot of fun for you might also be lacking in the emotional connection department. You may wonder if you should let this person go so you can look for someone else who's open about their feelings in a more conventional way. However, the bigger lesson for you now could be about freeing yourself from what others think you should do. Let your intuition guide you on how to move forward, even if the result is different from what you expect.","You may have ambitious plans for getting a lot done around your house today. However, others you live with might not be as interested in this as you are, so be ready to adjust your expectations to prevent any interpersonal frustrations. As long as you stay focused on things that you have the right to do, you can get a lot done working by yourself! You may be able to successfully combine a view of the big picture with attention to detail for amazing results.","An opportunity for investing or collaborating with your money or other resources might tempt you at this time. However, don't let anyone else push you into a commitment! It should be your choice on your terms. Fortunately, you're now more likely than usual to know the right questions to ask, which can be really important whenever you're trying to understand something complicated -- especially financial topics. Remember that anything worth pursuing is worth spending time and effort to advocate for your own interests.","Achieving stability in your home life could be so important to you at this time that you're willing to invest more of your own resources into making it happen. Before you go all out, though, make sure that other people involved are on the same page. Someone else -- who you might be counting on -- may be working toward a different goal that conflicts with yours. You're better off knowing the truth now, even if it isn't what you want to hear.","Changing one of your routines might be appealing to you now. However, as you begin pursuing this, you could discover that figuring out the details of how you want things to work on a daily basis is a different challenge from having the basic idea to revolutionize your routine. Your regular interactions with the people around you may bring up concerns you hadn't thought of on your own. With them and with yourself, being precise in your speech can help you get what you want.","Getting an accurate picture of your current budget might require you to be honest about what you really spend money on. It's not necessarily wrong to take risks and have fun at times. In fact, feeling bad about doing those things might harm your financial outlook more than actually doing them! When you're realistic about your desires and how often you give in to them, you can make financial estimates that are truthful enough to support some concrete plans for your future.","Playing the levelheaded peacemaker in one of your friend groups or communities could be satisfying for you now. However, you may be frustrated that you can't successfully work this magic within your own family. While social life often has clear rules and expectations, families sometimes operate according to their own norms that seem impervious to logic. Acknowledging your primal side might help you better understand others who seem stuck in this way of being -- you might even discover it has its own strange logic.","Intentional honesty can work better for you than you expect right now -- especially because even if you may have your reasons to keep secrets, the truth could still come out regardless. If you're able to tell your story before anyone else does so, people might give your version of events a fairer hearing than it would otherwise receive. Stay candid, but also keep in mind that some details aren't relevant to share, even if listeners might find them exciting."
2022-01-05,"Being serious is sensible, but letting go can feel so good! Value-finding Venus holds back somewhat in the practical sign of Capricorn, but her sextile with limitless Neptune in Pisces at 11:03 am EST is an opportunity for release. We may see the best in each other and dream without restriction. Later in the day, as the sensitive Moon enters Pisces and meets extravagant Jupiter, the sentimental mood could increase. We might not see complicated details clearly right now, but they can wait until later.","Secrets could come out for you in a good way today, as you might finally get public recognition for work you've been putting in behind the scenes. However, you may also be rewarded more privately for your achievements, even if just by your own ability to quietly take pride in a job well done. While hearing other people express appreciation can certainly feel good, the greatest validation is when you know in your heart that you are on the right track.","You may find yourself idealizing a community you belong to, especially one that has a focus on spirituality or improving the world. While it's fine to enjoy the good vibes, make sure you don't completely lose your own identity in the intense energy of this group. You are still responsible for your own actions, so pay attention to whether or not you like the side of yourself that comes out around these people. For better or for worse, uniting with others can be powerful!","Promising career developments may be brewing for you now, but someone that you're eager to impress could be more interested in discussing big ideas than in being specific about the details at this point. While you likely have reason to be proud that you're getting recognized, try to keep a clear head and ask the questions you need answered before you commit to anything. You might want to take special care that they're able to back up any overly optimistic ideas about money matters.","Getting the confidence to explore your adventurous side on your own might be difficult. However, joining forces with someone else could be very rewarding for you at this time! Whether you work together to plan an exciting trip or set out on a more inward journey, two heads are likely better than one. The other person may see possibilities you don't for making everything fit together in a wonderful way. Once they address your worries, you may feel comfortable enough to contribute your own strengths.","Your intuition may be strong today, which could help you get insight on a frustrating potential problem with your health. Sometimes it makes sense to view your body issues as random things that come out of nowhere, but right now it may be more useful to look at any physical complaints as intentional messages that your body is trying to send you. Even if what you learn doesn't make your symptoms go away, your knowledge about anything that's happening can give you more peace.","Admiring a helpful person in your life isn't a bad thing, but doing so to the point you see them as the source of everything positive might cause some issues. While they may legitimately be a positive influence on you, try to clarify where they end and you begin. You might have trouble taking credit for your own good qualities if you give them too much credit for your strengths. Respecting yourself can help you handle this relationship in a more balanced way.","Sticking closely to your well-planned routine might not be realistic today, but you probably need a break from it anyway. Letting go and relaxing at home could feel really good for you now, so you might as well embrace a chill mood. Though figuring out the best way to take care of your health may be a surprisingly frustrating item on your to-do list, sometimes doing nothing is actually the best thing to do. Enjoy your favorite mindless entertainment without guilt!","You can bring fun into your routine interactions with the people around you today! While your sign has a reputation for transformation, that doesn't always have to mean something dark and dramatic. When you let your imaginative and creative side show, you may be able to do something as simple as transform acquaintances into friends. Sharing a hearty laugh together can be a great way to bond, especially if you display a good-natured sense of humor that doesn't seek to bring anyone down.","Getting some positive news about your finances could help you see possibilities you hadn't previously thought of for your home life. Even if you don't have the resources to act on your idea just yet, even getting to the point where your next step is visible is a huge achievement! You may not be able to work out all the details today, but you can take pride in what you've done and enjoy fantasizing about what is still to come.","Putting the best spin on yourself may encourage others to agree that you look good today -- plus, you don't have to worry about this being selfish! When you move through life with healthy self-confidence, you have a positive attitude that can spread to the people around you. You might not be engaged with important-sounding issues in the larger world at the moment, but you can still make a difference by paying attention to others in any conversations that come up during your routine activities.","Your financial picture may be brighter than you think! As money planet Venus remains retrograde through your 12th House of Secrets, you might re-discover funds you'd forgotten about or thought were lost. While this could certainly be exciting, let the dust settle before you commit to spending your newfound gains. The first possibility that pops into your mind may not be the most important thing for you to buy right now, so take some time to think through all of the possibilities.","It's often easier to let people think what they want about you so that you can move through your day without friction. This doesn't have to be a bad thing, but you need to know when to stop! Don't let yourself drift into a commitment that you know isn't going to work out just to keep the peace in the moment. While you do have the potential to be charismatic and popular today, make sure you're getting attention for reasons you can live with."
2022-01-06,"Change can come with a peaceful, easy feeling today, helping us to be steady and remain standing on the ground. The intuitive Moon in Pisces forms a productive sextile with innovative Uranus at 2:04 pm EST, inspiring everyone to identify what may be due for an update. However, this aspect is tame enough that we can do what must be done without a lot of drama. Being sensitive to the needs of others might help us find the right moment to take action.","Money and self-confidence could seem to be linked for you at this time -- having a breakthrough with one might make you feel better about the other as well. While money isn't everything, it can help you take action that supports your values in the world. It may be hard for you to tell the difference between taking pride in your accomplishments and acknowledging your right to exist regardless of your achievements, but just remember that you have value as a person no matter what.","Something you post on social media today could really resonate with others, and you may be surprised at the response. With the practical, grounded nature your sign is known for, you might think that you're just stating the obvious. However, stating the obvious can be revolutionary in times when overgrown ideals have distracted everyone else from reality! Sharing your personal experiences may be just the reminder others need that any big plans for groups of people also need to work for the specific humans involved.","You may be attracted to the security of following an authority-approved and definitely safe path at the moment. However, you might also have more complicated feelings about whatever's happening. You can honor those feelings and keep the peace by making some adjustments in a gentle rather than disruptive way. It might also turn out that the authority figures also see things with more complexity than you would have thought, so try asking them what they really think before you take action based on any assumptions.","Friends might share some interesting ideas with you now. You could be tempted to agree, but you may also worry that these new thoughts contradict some current beliefs that you've been relying on for your sense of security. However, the gulf between new and old might be smaller than you think! You don't have to make a permanent commitment to anything today, but following your curiosity at a pace that's comfortable for you is probably a good use of your time.","The quiet knowledge that someone else has your back can give you the confidence to move forward toward your goals at this time. However, you may be better off talking to them directly rather than just assuming on your own that they're on your side. While your hunch is probably on the right track, hearing a pep talk straight from them could be especially uplifting. The way they express their support might also include observations you wouldn't expect, which may be informative for you.","Someone talking with you one-on-one could challenge your thinking in a way you wouldn't be likely to hear out otherwise. When the conversation is just between you and one other person, you are responsible for your own position -- you can't hide behind a large posse that agrees with you. Without strength in numbers, you may need to rely on realistic potential outcomes of both points of view. Be honest about which opinion gets the best results in reality, even if it isn't yours.","Attention to detail can help you shape a winning collaboration. Working together in a balanced way may get you far better results than working alone at this time. To begin, let your collaborator handle their fair share of the details. You may be tempted to do everything yourself to guarantee that it will be up to your standards, but this could get you stuck doing everything going forward. Trust the other person to pull their weight now and see what happens! You might be pleasantly surprised.","Engaging with someone else who may seem a bit out there can help you express your own individuality better. While what you'd like to share may not be identical to what the other person is talking about, you might get some helpful pointers from paying close attention to their style. Watch how they handle things that scare you, such as disapproving responses from listeners. Even if their approach isn't a perfect fit for you, it may give you valuable food for thought.","Making a permanent change to your routine can be difficult, but setting up your home in a way that supports your goal may help. You could put items you're trying to avoid in storage, if you aren't ready to get rid of them entirely, or you might place reminders of an activity you want to do more often in a very visible location. Out of sight is out of mind, and the opposite is also true. Sometimes a simple solution gets the job done!","You may have been developing a greater interest in expressing your individuality lately, and today could be a good opportunity to share that with the people around you in a way that doesn't shock them too much. However, don't be too surprised if others already figured some things out on their own before you got around to officially telling them. Words aren't the only form of communication, so your ability to control the narrative may not be as complete as you think.","Home life could have some surprises for you at this time, but you can feel proud of yourself if you rise to the occasion. Though you may be grateful to find that your finances are already flexible enough to weather some disruption, today's events might give you some ideas about what you could be doing better. Don't feel bad about not thinking of something sooner! Sometimes you can't know what you need to make room for in your budget until it arrives.","Coincidences could be especially exciting for you now, and you might wonder if they have a deeper meaning. With the sensitive Moon in your sign today, you may also be more attuned than usual to any emotional undercurrents around you. Even if you aren't consciously aware of this, it could help you find just who you need to run into or pick up what you need to attract like a magnet. Enjoy your spontaneous encounters, whether or not there are any hidden meanings to them."
2022-01-07,"Things are likely to move forward quickly today. The Moon sets our pace as it makes driving sextiles with the Sun, Venus, and Pluto, all in productive Capricorn. However, as the Moon in ambiguous Pisces meets truth-stretching Neptune at 7:40 am EST and also squares aggressive Mars, we may be tempted to cut a few corners to reach our goals more quickly. While manipulating others might seem necessary to relieve our emotional turmoil, having the patience to do things honestly will likely have better long-term results.","You might be your own worst enemy in an ideological dispute today, as the views you defend in public could actually differ from some of your own private feelings. However, an authority figure that you respect may be able to break the tie in a helpful way. If they come down on the side of whatever you have been holding back, you might feel like you have permission to let go of some outdated beliefs that no longer serve you.","Sharing your political or spiritual views with your friends could be validating for you today, as they might seem particularly impressionable and open to what you are telling them. This may feel great, especially if you've been through a long struggle to get to the clarity of your current philosophy. However, your audience may only want to go so deep. Be alert to signs that they've reached their limit of friendly curiosity, and try not to push anyone past their comfort level.","Your relationship with an authority figure may be totally frustrating for you at this time. You could feel like you can't please them because their expectations are continually shifting. However, you might have to acknowledge it if they help you financially, though some strings are probably attached. You may not be able to get the respect you want from them on a personal level right now, but if throwing their money around makes them feel powerful, you might as well benefit from it!","Someone that you're close with may put a lot of pressure on you to change your views about an important topic. You might want to do the right thing for this person you care about, but you could also be conflicted by other commitments of yours. Try to base your decision on objective facts, such as what gets results in the real world. If you need to tell someone no, at least you'll be able to defend your choice by having a good reason.","Vague details about the way you share money or property with someone else may have gotten out of hand. Though you might have benefited from flexibility in the past, you could now be at a point where you need more specific boundaries in order to move forward. The other person may be willing to work with you, but they also might not see anything wrong with how things are now. Consider spending some time in advance figuring out exactly what you think should change.","One of your close relationships may feel rather off-balance at this time. The other person could seem weak, creating a power vacuum you might feel tempted to step into. While some amount of leadership from you may actually be welcome, taking on a parental role toward the other person is probably taking it too far. Make sure your goal is to help the other person get stronger rather than to keep them dependent on you, and know when to back off.","You might have an intuitive sense of how to fix something broken in your home. However, explaining your plan to others could be frustrating, as the conversation may continually get derailed into assigning blame for the breaking rather than agreeing on how to do the fixing. Just doing what needs to be done may be easier than talking for you at this time. As long as you have the authority to do so, feel free to take care of the problem on your own.","Telling people what they want to hear might succeed in getting you what you want now. While you may worry that this requires you to compromise your deeply held values, take a realistic look at how much information the person you're dealing with actually needs in order to go away. You probably don't have to give them a dramatic dissertation, though the fantasy may be tempting. Instead, look for a brief and ambiguous answer that lets you successfully end the conversation.","Emotional manipulation from your family might make asserting yourself challenging at this time. There may be no good answer in a battle between your passions and their passions -- things could come down to simply whose feelings are bigger and louder. However, the status of your money and other physical resources might be less ambiguous. Either you have the funds to do what you want, or you don't. If you want to make a controversial purchase with your own money, others probably can't stop you!","No matter what you say today, people may hear what they want to hear -- even if they're allegedly listening to you. This might make them like you, and you may enjoy the positive attention. However, if you actually had an important message to convey, you could be frustrated to discover that it got lost in all the excitement. You may have to decide whether it's more important to maintain some good vibes or to push people to really understand you.","It may be easy for friends or charitable organizations to gain money from you today. Before you open your wallet, be clear with yourself about what you hope to get out of giving. You might have an image of yourself as a good, caring person that you're eager to maintain. However, you can also privately acknowledge that being truly benevolent is more complicated than it sometimes looks. Donating now could potentially meet both standards, so just be sure to think about it first.","You may feel like an authority figure is pushing you to make a decision you don't want to make. The worst part might be fearing that your friends will be disappointed if you choose a side that they don't agree with. See if you can wait until things calm down before you commit to anything. In the meantime, you might want to consider whether or not the people pressuring you will have your back if doing what they want ends badly for you."
2022-01-08,"Things may look good on the outside today, but getting the inside to catch up could be harder. As the powerful Sun meets beautiful Venus in dignified Capricorn at 7:48 pm EST, we might feel like the way we've set up our lives is working for us. However, the emotional Moon's conjunction with wounded Chiron in edgy Aries could feed any frustrations under the surface. Luna also forms a sextile with thoughtful Mercury, so finding new ways to tell our stories may relieve some tension.","You may receive public recognition that you've long desired today. Unfortunately, when it finally comes, it might not be all you'd hoped it would be. While getting the blessing of authority figures can feel really good, there are some emotional wounds that it just can't fix. Don't be afraid to be honest with your friends about how you are doing. Something as simple as acknowledging out loud that there is a gap between reality and your expectations may be healing.","You may be afraid that you've gotten on the wrong side of the rules, but any dealings you may have with bureaucratic regulations are actually more likely than usual to go in your favor now. With the heat of a perceived crisis diminished, you can use this opportunity to look at where your fear might really be coming from. Today's upset could remind you of a situation that was handled badly in the past -- you may need to acknowledge that times have changed.","A potential arrangement for sharing money or property could work very well for you, but it also may not resemble how you expected your life to look. The fear of having to explain something unconventional to your friends could be holding you back, as you may think the situation makes you appear dependent on someone else to succeed. This time you might not be the only one in your peer group facing unusual tradeoffs -- you all may have to update your views!","Past wounds about power dynamics could be triggered by someone else reminding you of a past friendship that didn't go well, even if they don't mean to. However, this time, you might be able to talk to the other person about your concerns. Bringing up a difficult topic can be scary, but taking the risk is likely to go well for you right now. Successfully navigating a tough conversation may help you build more trust, which could renew your appreciation for your current connection.","Success can be found on your own terms right now -- not anyone else's! Whether you've finally finished a long to-do list or gained a clearer sense of your master plan, you might have reason to celebrate your strengths today. If you're still stuck carrying around an outdated view of yourself as a disorganized person, their impressed reactions might help you get rid of that. You may not start out as the Zodiac's most meticulous sign, but that doesn't mean you can't get anything done.","Having fun and enjoying yourself might be tempting today. Even so, you're probably keenly aware that your responsibilities still exist. Delegating some of your duties could get you more room to relax, but you still might be afraid of things not getting done to your standards. Identifying what, specifically, you fear losing control over can help you decide how to move forward. If you're able to trust someone else, this could turn out to be an opportunity for personal healing and growth.","A close relationship may be going through a rough patch at the moment, but spending time by yourself in a place where you feel secure can help you figure out how to respond. You are capable of having a productive conversation with the other person, as long as you come to it knowing where you stand. This should let you hear out their emotions without becoming as upset as they might be. By staying calm and centered, you can be the eye of any storm.","Responsibilities at home may seem overwhelming for you at this time, but others might actually be willing to pitch in if you let them know how you're feeling. The planets are equipping you with all you need to tell your side of the story in a way that others should find relatable. You can then go into the conversation confident that you'll get the results you want, rather than taking an aggressive approach out of fear that you won't be heard.","The people around you might be able to talk you into having a good time today, even if you're not feeling very friendly in the morning. While you may not be up for anything that seems too risky, you might have enough confidence in your finances at the moment that making a solid investment in pleasure seems worthwhile. In the end, the greatest joy will likely come from being heard and understood by your friends -- regardless of what you do or buy together.","You may look and feel good with today's powerful conjunction between the almighty Sun and gorgeous Venus in your sign. When opportunities for pleasure come your way, you might not be inclined to hold back! However, some monetary guilt that dates back to your early years could put a damper on your fun by telling you that you should save money, no matter what. Looking at your current financial picture rather than your past can help you find a healthy balance between responsibility and relaxation.","The intensity of your positive feelings for a friend or loved one might make you nervous -- in particular, the idea of being vulnerable enough to let the other person know how much you care could be terrifying. Ironically, if you don't have an outlet for your emotions, the building tension could lead you to snap at or be hurtful to the person in question. Do your best to open up to them -- it will probably go better than you expect!","Your finances might not be what you want them to be right now, especially if your friends appear to have more money than you do. Of course, you probably have more detailed information about your own situation than you do about theirs. Try to turn your focus inward and in a healthier direction by looking at the unconscious attitudes and habits that could be holding you back from your goals. Regardless of what's going on with others, you can become a better version of yourself."
2022-01-09,"Our raw emotional needs may challenge attempts to emphasize order. This is particularly true when the impulsive Aries Moon squares the reputation-concerned Sun and amicable Venus in traditional Capricorn today. However, the Moon also makes a friendly sextile with practical Saturn in innovative Aquarius, so we might be able to update our traditional structures without abandoning the whole idea of structure. Thoughtful Mercury in Aquarius sextiles tender Chiron in Aries at 9:07 pm EST, helping us listen to anything that needs to be heard out.","Social status could seem to come with a price for you right now, as you may feel like you have to continually work to keep up a certain image that doesn't truly reflect your whole self. While you might need to maintain some of these shallower connections for professional reasons, try to keep an eye out for those who don't bring out such stress or tension in you. Those people may be your real friends, and reaching out to them could be reassuring.","The nagging sensation of falling short of some personal goals could bug you today, but an overly rigid idea of how you feel success should look like could be holding you back. Take this opportunity to look at the big picture of your situation. You might find you've already accomplished more than you think, and seeing that can help you decide what to do next! You're absolutely capable of focused effort, but make sure that you're focused on something truly plausible.","Friendships could be frustrating for you today, but you may need to look at how realistic your expectations are -- or aren't! While you might be interested in deepening the emotional intimacy of your connections, some people could prefer to keep stronger boundaries. You may have to acknowledge that not everyone is equipped to open up in the way that you have in mind. The first step to true intimacy is accepting the other person just the way they are right now.","Your reputation could be a source of stress for you now, as you may feel like something difficult from your past is more widely known than you'd like it to be. The version going around also might not be your side of the story. While you probably can't control what everyone else ends up believing, opening up to someone you trust can give you validation that people can still see the good in you, in spite of whatever happened. Let your loved ones comfort you!","What you don't know can still hurt your pride at this time. You might be ashamed if some big holes in your knowledge become visible, to the point that feeling down on yourself about this deficiency could get in the way of doing anything productive about whatever problem you're trying to solve. However, other people may be more willing to teach you a few lessons than you would have expected. Don't be afraid to take a risk and ask for help!","Resolving a conflict about shared responsibilities could require your focus at this time. The way to get out of a frustrating disagreement might be found by defining each person's turf more clearly. You probably already know that you take pride in your individual accomplishments, but you might need to remember that other people also feel the same way about their achievements. When you give them room to do their thing, any interference from them may vanish as they flourish in their own space.","The idea of being vulnerable in a close relationship might be scary for you now. However, while this may seem like a stark dilemma between being totally open and hiding in your cocoon, it's likely not that bad. Today, you could be able to balance protecting your boundaries with growing your relationship at a comfortable pace. If you're used to throwing yourself into connecting with others, you might worry that you're holding too much back, but you're probably navigating the situation better than you think.","Putting your living space in order could feel great for you today. This could be due to the universe gifting you more patience than usual for the physical part of the process, but you'll probably enjoy the way it gets your thoughts flowing more than anything else. Still, sometimes things get dirtier before they get cleaner! Some of the brainstorms you have today might be better than others, but all of them should at least be fun to ponder as you tidy up.","You may be tempted to hide behind things that you think give you higher status with others, like fancy possessions or the right political beliefs. These items that others recognize as valuable might seem more secure than your view of yourself at the moment. However, if you put in the effort, you may find that telling your own personal truth goes better than you expect. Being honest even if you don't know the answer is at least less likely to backfire on you.","You may have trouble believing that the positive views others hold of you are accurate, as you know embarrassing things about yourself that they probably don't know. Trying to push yourself to live in the present could be frustrating, as nostalgia calls you to reflect on the past. Fortunately, taking ownership of your whole story, even the messy parts, might actually be rewarding. While others could be impressed by what they see you doing now, only you know how far you have truly come.","Keeping a serious vibe can give others confidence in your ability to take on tough conversations at the moment. You may be especially thoughtful in your responses to your friends and loved ones, as you could be equipped to view things in a way that acknowledges the importance of emotion but doesn't get bogged down by muddled feelings. That said, you should still make sure that your wise counsel to one person isn't accidentally giving away the secrets of anyone else.","A financial matter could be currently occupying your mind. Despite what others may think, you're probably better off thinking it through alone rather than getting advice from your friends. No matter how well they mean, what works for you might be different from what works for them. You deserve space to handle things in your own way without the frustration of anyone second-guessing you. When you learn to listen to your own voice of reason, you can be realistic about your needs."
2022-01-10,"We may see realistic possibilities for improvement throughout today. This is thanks to the focused Sun in Capricorn making a friendly sextile with idealistic Neptune in Pisces at 10:28 pm EST. The sensitive Moon also forms a challenging square to manipulative Pluto, so we may take it personally when others point out gaps between our dreams and reality. In the end, as Luna goes on to form a lucky sextile with fortunate Jupiter, we might be able to accept that they're just trying to help.","Spending time alone may be good for you today. While you can work successfully toward your goals, you might be better off first ensuring that they're truly your goals and not someone else's idea of success that you've picked up along the way. Mentors can be helpful, but finding the right boundaries with them is not always easy. You can plot a course to improve your boundaries and refine your goals by taking some time to get in touch with what you privately value.","Inaccurate ideas about the world could be holding you back, and you might be the last to know! Your friends may be able to give you a necessary nudge to move forward. The fear of making a dramatic break from your past could have prevented you from going there in the past, but you probably don't need to make a big display of rejecting your prior views. Consider reaching out to others who are going through similar changes to remind yourself that you're not alone.","Excitement about an in-progress collaboration on a personal goal could fill your heart at this time, and it might be hard for you to stop yourself from telling everyone you know all about it. However, you might be better off giving your project the space it needs to develop before you introduce it to the world. For now, focus on building trust with your team. When the time is right, you can work together to share your good news with others.","Your longing for adventure may be more powerful than it is focused at the moment. Someone else in your life could be very happy to provide you with perhaps more direction than you want. However, even their less helpful suggestions can at least remind you of what doesn't interest you. Let their ideas kickstart you into doing some more productive research on your own time. Once you get going, you may find that you have all the confidence and determination you need!","Any efforts to explore a fascinating investment opportunity may be stymied by authority figures or bureaucratic processes at this time. Still, try to keep in mind that they could actually be looking out for you! While you might be able to make your big idea work in the end, the little details could trip you up if you aren't careful. Be sure to get the practical parts of your plan nailed down first, and then you can let your dreams run wild.","You may really idealize someone in your life right now, but trying to hold on to them too tightly could push them away. While this person might have great qualities, focus on the good things that they bring out in you. Their influence may allow you to explore your intellectual side more than usual. Instead of relying on anyone else today, try reading a book you've always wanted to read. That way, you can have something to share when you next talk to them.","Being flexible in your routine could work better for you than having a rigid schedule at this time. Though the flakiness of your family or others you live with may drive you crazy, try to think of disruptions as excess energy that needs an outlet rather than intentional attempts to ruin your life. If you make an effort to look at the situation in an intuitive way, you may be able to see what some underlying requirements are and proactively work to address them.","Talking to someone else about a creative idea you have brewing may be helpful for you at the moment. While you might feel that they're overly picky about the details, you probably should be able to answer some of their questions, at least to yourself, in order to move forward with the project. They could be genuinely trying to make your idea better! That said, if their approach is not a good fit for you, you don't have to answer to them.","Visions of a home makeover may be swirling in your head -- you might want the sky to be the only limit! While becoming aware of what you can afford could seem to throw a wet blanket on your fun, this constraint may ultimately give you enough focus to plan a plausible project that you'll actually be able to get done. Once you can make out some clearly defined possibilities, feel free to start taking the first concrete steps toward your goal.","Keeping a little wiggle room in the way you talk to others could work well for you at this time. You may want to avoid getting pinned down to a particular position, whether it's because you're trying to keep your options open or because you're attempting to remain friends with people on multiple sides of a controversial topic. As long as you don't take it too far, this ambiguous approach can give you the space you need to plot your next move.","The way you currently handle money may look unstructured, but you might actually have clearer underlying logic than you let on. This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- as long as you're aware of what that logic is. While you may have valid reasons to keep your methods and information private from others, secrets you keep from yourself have the potential to be used against you. However, when you understand what deeply motivates you, you can then use that great power to push forward.","Your friends may be a dominant presence in your life at this time, and you might be grateful for the direction they provide you. Even if your own identity feels a little vague these days, you could wind up discovering what you do want when your friends pressure you to do something that you don't want to do. Situations like this may be your best way to find clarity now, so embrace them -- even if they are a bit awkward."
2022-01-11,"Our passion for our beliefs may cause conflict. We particularly should watch out when fiery Mars squares idealistic Neptune at 4:43 pm EST! Meanwhile, the sensitive Moon runs into friction with shocking Uranus and frustrating Saturn, and the resulting uncertainty could definitely provoke us to hold fast to our truths. However, the Moon also makes a healing trine to beautiful Venus this evening. Though we might not intellectually understand everything that happens, we can most likely trust what makes us feel good physically.","Aggressively defending your beliefs could seem like a way for you to increase your social status at this time, as you may see yourself as the spokesperson for a large group of people. However, it might be all too easy to get carried away. If you cross the line into statements or actions that aren't rational, even people on your side might be alienated. You can still make some good points today, but you should probably stop sooner than you may think is necessary.","You may have a longing for adventure at this time -- which could emerge in the form of stirring up drama with your friends if you don't find a healthy outlet for it. Even if you're feeling pressured to lead a responsible life and do what authority figures expect of you, there is likely something in you that wants more excitement. No one else can truly make this happen for you, so you might need to find a way to be honest about your desires.","Deciding who has the authority to make a big decision in one of your relationships might not be as straightforward as you'd like. If there isn't a clear answer based on accepted tradition, you could be tempted to look to spirituality, but that might only complicate things further. If you and the other person can be honest with each other about any ways that your current situation doesn't follow the usual rules, you may be able to work out a creative solution together.","The belief that it's your duty to sacrifice for your job could motivate you to work hard today. However, if you see others not following the rules that bind you so tightly, you may become resentful. Confronting them about your frustrations could be fruitful, even if you don't get your intended results. Those rules might exist mainly inside your head! Your peers may show you evidence that it is possible to be committed to your work in a way that also allows for personal boundaries.","You may want to assert yourself today, but someone else could seem to be in your way. The most frustrating part is that you might discover the other person's boundaries by stepping on them, unintentionally causing some hurt or conflict in the process. If you start to see this develop into a pattern, you may be better off directly asking the other person what they DO want you to do. While discussing power dynamics openly can be intimidating, it can also get you real solutions.","Getting a lot done around the house could be on your agenda now, but others you might want to help out may not be on the same page. If you don't give them room to be honest about their lack of interest, they could end up -- intentionally or accidentally -- sabotaging you. Only pursue your domestic projects if you truly have enough enthusiasm to do them yourself! If there's something more fun that you'd rather be doing, consider doing that instead.","Irritation about a seemingly never-ending workload may provoke you to snap at others. On the other hand, the idea of starting a serious conversation about sharing responsibilities more fairly might petrify you. Even though it could potentially solve your problem, you may be afraid that someone else will become emotionally upset in a way you can't predict, while now you can at least control your own snarky comments. Do whatever you can live with, but taking the risk could go better than you expect.","Impulse purchases could tempt you today -- not so much for the specific thing you want to buy, but more for the pleasure of being able to say yes when exasperating circumstances at home keep telling you no. Instead of opening your wallet, try talking to someone about your frustrations. Even if they can't get rid of any circumstances that limit you, the feeling of simply being seen and heard for once might be quite a relief all on its own.","Being a rebel without a cause might feel frustrating for you at the moment. You may have the energy to burn, but finding something that seems meaningful enough to use it on could be challenging. Thankfully, your routine work might turn out to be more intense than usual today! A problem that comes up as you get other stuff done could be just the challenge you crave. There may even be a financial reward in it for you, so get ready to show your stuff!","You may think that you're successfully concealing your complex feelings toward the people around you, but any resentment could be less hidden than you think in the way you talk. While you might be concerned with looking good, you may be better off being honest. If people can already tell that something's wrong, they could be relieved to know what it really is. The problem they imagine in the meantime might be worse than your real grievance, so don't put off ending the speculation.","You may have a powerful urge to impress your friends now, but your efforts could be straining your finances or even your values. If you feel like you aren't enough for others just the way you are, you might need to focus on being a better friend to yourself! Spending some time alone could help you reconnect with what makes you feel secure. How others take care of themselves may not be what works for you, so honor your unique desires.","The desire for recognition may currently take hold of you, as getting validation from the outside world might seem like the best way to resolve your uncertainty about who you are. While your ambition could indeed lead you to worthwhile achievements, connecting with your friends may help you stay grounded enough to enjoy any rewards in a healthy way. Your pals can give you room to express your quirky human nature without the pressure of the need to be larger than life."
2022-01-12,"The answers that seem too obvious to be true might actually be the right ones today! As the grounded Taurus Moon forms a harmonious trine with the practical Capricorn Sun at 6:20 am EST, things might not need to be too complicated in order to work out. Of course, a simple approach doesn't have to be a shallow one. The Moon also makes friendly contact with visionary Neptune and powerful Pluto, so our hunches about how to move forward may be quite significant.","Seeing how your work toward your goals has already increased your material security may be encouraging for you at this time. As you determine your next steps, you probably need to acknowledge that meeting your financial needs really matters for you. However, you could need to look at whether you control this desire or if it controls you. When you're more consciously aware of the way you move through life, you might find more satisfaction with the results you get.","Feeling your feelings could be exactly what the world needs from you today. You're likely to get something even more significant than simple emotional release because your heart is connected to your mind as well as your emotions. If you're willing to share your experiences, the meaning you find in them could also help others. You may not be the only one dealing with the sort of challenges you face -- but you might be more articulate about dealing with them than most people would.","Giving yourself some privacy to deal with an intense issue could be important right now. However, it may be necessary for you to recognize the difference between taking healthy space and becoming unhealthily secluded. Even if talking to another person wouldn't be helpful for you at the moment, it might be wise to at least remain connected to the idea of something larger than yourself. Rather than judgment, outside sources could provide a reminder that life is bigger than any current drama.","Getting to know a peer better could go well for you at this time. You may discover that you share an intellectual or spiritual passion, which would make for a great foundation on which to build a strong bond. While changing the boundaries of your established acquaintanceship could be awkward, your common link should give you enough gentle guidance to avoid this problem, as having similar points of view regarding some of the big things in life can reduce the overall potential for miscommunication.","You may be able to get a lot done as you focus on the day-to-day tasks of your work -- and you could also encounter enough depth to get a glimpse of your larger professional direction. You might want to start gathering information about the process of setting up things like taxes, insurance, and investments to take your career to the next level. Though you may not be ready to make these decisions right now, even getting them on your radar is a big achievement.","Shallow pleasure might not be satisfying for you now, but a thought-provoking book or movie could be just the entertainment you need. Sharing this experience with someone you want to know better may also be rewarding! While starting a conversation about personal matters out of nowhere could be too intimidating, talking about the media you just enjoyed together might help you both open up in a gentle way. You can always refocus on the story if you feel like you need more space.","Fresh insights about the deeper meaning of a complicated dynamic in your family may be available at the moment. It might seem counterintuitive, but the small details of people's daily lives could be what actually reveals the big picture to you. You may wonder if you're being petty for focusing on things like that, but if there's tension surrounding even seemingly insignificant things, then someone has to say something! You might be the only one willing to address whatever is causing the bad vibes.","A good conversation with someone you trust could go well for you at this time, as the two of you together can balance deep communication with a healthy dose of optimism and boundaries. Taking a structured and grounded approach may help you beyond the pleasure of feeling heard and understood in the moment. While there might be things about yourself that you have trouble defining, some patient conversations can give you the space you need to work your way to answers.","Solving problems in a practical way may be on the agenda for you today, but you don't have to keep your head entirely out of the clouds. While you might need to stay grounded in realities like what you can afford and what you're physically capable of getting done, staying in touch with your intuitive sense of what would make you feel most secure could help you identify the best course of action. You may find that you can be both comfortable and cost-conscious!","Your self-confidence could be at a high point today, and the people around you may notice. Though telling others what's on your mind might not be your focus, you could give away some of it just in the way you carry yourself. Are you OK with what they may pick up about you? It might be a good idea to think about your perspective and what it does to the attitude you have toward the world. Don't let your own ego get in your way!","Getting the rest that you need could be very important for you at this time, but you may wonder if you can afford to nurture yourself in this way. Taking an inventory of all your resources, material and otherwise, can help you view your financial concerns from a healthy perspective. Overall, you may be closer to security than you think! Plus, you might need to nurture yourself emotionally and physically before you can push forward and get more clarity on money matters.","Communicating with friends or members of an organization you belong to could take up a lot of your time today. However, you may find that you can say quite a bit without revealing your own position. Your personal views might not be relevant if you're dealing with something that isn't really about you, like brokering peace in a conflict between others. As long as you don't let your ambiguity lead people to expect things you don't intend to deliver, you can provide some valuable insight."
2022-01-13,"Today is our last chance to get things done before the notorious challenge of Mercury Retrograde strikes tomorrow. We may find ourselves trying to squeeze in too many activities as the scattered Moon in Gemini squares optimistic Jupiter. Fortunately, with the Moon's helpful trine to intellectual Mercury in big-picture Aquarius at 7:10 pm EST, we might also be able to find order beneath any chaos. Working hard to tie up loose ends now can give us the room we will need to relax later.","There may be a lot going on in your social life now, but you might also be aware of more internal activity than usual in your mind. Try mixing the two by letting your friends know what's really on your mind. It could go better than you think -- but watch out for the temptation to overshare! Take things slowly at first, and that may help you find a way of communicating more openly that you can live with long term.","A variety of interesting opportunities in your professional life may be on your mind at the moment. While making a decision about what to pursue further might be difficult, asking yourself what makes you feel most secure could remove at least some of the contenders. You might be surprised to discover that the option you think your friends would find most impressive winds up off the table. Keep in mind that regardless of their opinions, you're the one who has to live with your choice.","Putting your feelings into words may be easier than usual for you today. That said, you might not be able to guarantee that everyone you talk to will agree with you. While some people could really benefit from hearing your perspective, venting to the wrong audience might cause some drama that you won't want to deal with. Try to identify in advance who is likely to be sympathetic to your basic view of the world, and save your breath for them.","Gathering information about a serious matter can go well for you today, as you're likely to be able to balance getting all the details with demonstrating sensitivity toward those sharing those details. What might be harder at this point is assembling the myriad facts you're collecting into a coherent understanding of the situation as a whole. While you may not be able to know everything for sure at this point, remain calm and allow your intuition to guide you further.","Deepening your emotional connection with a friend could be rewarding for you at this time, as you may find it easier than usual to share information regarding your personal matters. However, before talking to anyone else, you might want to envision what you want the new boundaries of your relationship to look like. Going too deep could get you into trouble, so make sure that you're only updating your limits rather than getting rid of the idea of limits entirely.","As you focus on getting the details aligned in your work today, you might get a glimpse of your progress toward your larger career goals. No matter how optimistic you feel, if your future plan relies on the cooperation of another person, you may need to consider checking in with them about their side of the story. It could be easy to overestimate how committed they are, so you're better off knowing the truth now -- even if it isn't what you want to hear.","You can get gratifying fulfillment from taking care of your current responsibilities, especially if you can clearly see that the results of your hard work. It may be more difficult to identify immediate and obvious progress toward vaguer goals like personal growth, so you might be tempted to not bother trying. However, tearing yourself away from the low-hanging fruit of your to-do list could be worthwhile, as today you may be better equipped than normal to get a handle on your personal big picture.","You could be a key figure in a discussion of how to handle money or other resources within your home or family now, as you may be really good at analyzing and describing the group's needs. However, you might be so sold on a particular course of action that makes logical sense for the whole group that you could lose track of whether it works for you personally. Do your best to be honest with yourself, even if it messes up a seemingly perfect plan.","A meeting of the minds could be achievable for you today, as you may be able to have a fulfilling conversation with someone close to you. The challenges of sharing physical space -- whether or not you share a living area with them -- might be harder to sort out, as it could be difficult to show care for each other without feeling suffocated. Remember that keeping a little bit of distance from the other person can give you more to talk about with them.","Your mind is likely on your money these days, and you could put this focus to good use by figuring how to earn more from your work. As you make your plan, be careful to avoid promising anything to yourself or others that you may not be able to deliver. You probably have more than you think going for you already, so stick to the current facts instead of speculating about how much better you may do in the future!","Pleasure may call your name today, making it feel like your money is burning a hole in your wallet. Your thoughts might be focused on what would make you personally feel good, and you could also feel particularly confident in your finances at the moment. Though this might sound a little selfish, holding back could hurt more than giving in! As long as you can afford it, you might as well get something that you'll be able to enjoy using for a long time.","You could be going through a growth spurt these days, and sometimes expanding in this way takes more energy than you realize. Getting the rest that you need might be the most important thing you can do for yourself at this time! When you're caught in a whirlwind of activity, stepping out of it to relax can give you an opportunity to make sense of everything you may have experienced lately. This can help you feel refreshed and ready for the next round of excitement."
2022-01-14,"Patience may be necessary at this time! Mercury Retrograde, an infamous phenomenon associated with miscommunications and misbehaving electronics, begins at 6:41 am EST today. Unfortunately, patience might be the last thing we have as the impulsive Moon in Gemini opposes aggressive Mars. We may want what we want when we want it, and the Moon's square to manipulative Neptune could convince us that showing off over-the-top emotions will help us get it faster. However, indulging in drama might only increase the length of any delays.","You may feel like no one is on your side in a heated argument about politics, religion, or another controversial topic. Though friends or community members could be the antagonists you're battling right now, perhaps the bigger problem is that even you aren't necessarily on your own side! Your passion for the views you loudly defend could cover up doubts you secretly carry about those same opinions in more vulnerable parts of yourself. Try to resolve any internal conflicts before you drag others into them.","An aggressive fundraising effort could prey on your emotions today. Though you might feel like you're a bad person if you don't donate, just consider who can tell you what to do with your money. Whether or not anyone reaches out to you specifically, the idea of people in desperate financial need could weigh on you. Instead of listening to guilt, try taking a step back and thinking about if you're truly equipped to fix whatever they feel desperate about. It's OK if you aren't!","You may currently believe that you need to defend an authority figure you revere from someone else's criticism. After all, you might know that bad things happen to you whenever you're less than completely subservient toward this authority figure, so it would be too infuriating to see others get away with insubordination if you can't. You may need to look at whether or not the way you handle your relationship with this leader is in line with your own belief system.","Reconfiguring any shared responsibilities that have fallen out of balance could be a great project for you once fussy Mercury turns retrograde this morning. While you're capable of working hard, your resentment is likely to hold you back from performing at your full potential if you feel like things aren't being handled fairly. Before you share your concerns with others, try to identify your own expectations for the situation. If what you want isn't realistic, that might not be anyone else's fault!","Asserting yourself in an organization you're involved with could be frustrating for you at the moment, as you may end up stepping on people's toes no matter what you do. The true problem might stem from unclear boundaries! While you may think you have the right to take action based on the written rules, the guidelines that actually get enforced might differ. Try talking to someone you trust before you move forward. They may know something important about any unspoken sensitivities involved.","You may have to distinguish between working smarter and working harder now, as your services could be in high demand! Whether your most pressing obligation is at work, the community, or your home, you might be challenged by the shifting expectations of someone else involved. It could be really frustrating to put in a lot of effort to please them only to find out that they want something different. If you can, just give them space to figure themselves out before you get too invested.","Receiving inconsistent instructions could make it hard for you to get stuff done today. A person you work with directly may ask you to do things one way, but someone else claiming to speak on behalf of the rules could demand a different method. Try to determine whether any disputes are truly about the tasks at hand. If you feel like the warring parties are using you as a pawn in their personal feud, you may need to insist on sticking to business.","Throwing your weight around in a situation where you share resources with others may tempt you at this time, but you might need to back off if you're not yet entirely clear on what you hope to get out of it. The Mercury Retrograde starting today can help you adjust your sense of what gives you security. When you negotiate from a place of stability, you should be able to use what you have in a way that meets your needs without manipulating others.","You may want to assert yourself today, but you can also see how doing so might threaten the security you get from going along with things as they are. It could be tempting to release any inner tension you feel on others, but making an effort to listen more carefully than usual may help you avoid seeing their innocent comments as provocations. They might simply be more open than you are about their attachment to the status quo, which could be setting you off.","Petty frustrations could provoke you to snap in a surprising way at this time. If you can sense something like this brewing, you might need to look at how much anger you're carrying around. You may find it hard to communicate with people directly, but if they've been disrespecting your values or helping themselves to your property for a while, your irritation might not be about whatever is setting you off in the moment. Being clear about your boundaries can preemptively relieve tension.","Your friends may really get on your nerves at the moment. Though it could be tempting to blame them for upsetting you, it's possible that no one is necessarily doing anything wrong. Their current energy might simply be a mismatch for yours! They may want to have some rambunctious fun, but you might feel pulled to turn inward as Mercury Retrograde begins in your sign today. Taking some personal space to do your own thing can help you get the calm you need.","Circumstances may push you to take on a more public role than usual today, but any worries that stepping up will ruin your privacy might not be warranted. While you could be preoccupied with the progress you've been making toward understanding secrets that may have been weighing on you for a while, any past drama might not be relevant to what the world needs from you at the moment. You can make a positive difference without getting into the full complexity of your views."
2022-01-15,"Conflict between new and old may strike without warning. As the day begins, the impulsive Moon in Gemini pushes against the established Sun and entrenched Pluto. After the Moon enters nurturing Cancer at 11:11 am EST, we can figure out how to move into the future with sensitivity while honoring the positive parts of our past. Luna then makes a friendly trine with expansive Jupiter, so there may be room for different approaches to coexist as long as we give each other space.","You may be deferring to an authority figure because that's what you think everyone else does. Use today to take the risk of talking to the people around you about the situation -- their perspective might be more nuanced than you expect! Learning something like this could give you the necessary security to feel comfortable formulating an opinion of your own. Sorting through your ambiguous feelings might require more work than following the crowd, but you've got the confidence to make it work.","The philosophies that guide your life could seem inadequate to solve a problem for you today. Talking to a friend or community member may help you decide what to do about the discrepancy, especially if they can see the situation from a more expansive perspective. Let them help you loosen any rigid attitudes that may be holding you back! Even if you can't come up with a specific answer between the two of you, just being heard out could lessen your frustration.","A situation where you engage intensely with others could be engrossing for you at this time, to the point where you might lose track of yourself. While getting caught up in a moment like this can be enjoyable, make sure your involvement doesn't get so deep that you're thrown off the track of your career goals. Even if you've discovered that others can be there for you in a way you didn't think was possible, you still need to look after your own security.","Enhancing your commitment to a significant relationship of any type might appeal to you now, but you could also be conflicted about it. You may still want to keep some things private, which you might worry makes you seem less devoted to the other person. Expanding your beliefs about relationships can give you more space to both maintain your own identity and build a strong connection. Understanding your own needs may even make you a better companion than divulging every last bit of information would!","The desire to connect with your friends could conflict with the need to take care of your daily responsibilities. Keep in mind that if even your social life feels like yet another obligation you have to check off, then you might be better off doing your own thing. Allowing yourself space to rest can be transformative for you now, and it could also help you clarify some deeper priorities. With this knowledge, balancing any competing commitments may become easier for you going forward.","Trying to have fun could be more complicated than you think at the moment, as you might discover that your idea of what brings you joy is out of date. Past hobbies may feel shallow -- consider doing something related to your life goals instead. Working on that could bring you both pleasure and progress! Don't be afraid to invite others to join you, as pursuing a passion that has meaning together would be a great opportunity to strengthen your relationships.","Reading up on how to handle a complicated home or family situation could be frustrating for you right now, as you might feel like the respected authorities just don't understand what you're dealing with. If no one else seems qualified to advise you, it might be necessary to figure out what to do on your own. Happily, your intuitive sense of how to put things in order is probably reasonably accurate! The hardest part may be getting the confidence to listen to it.","You may feel like your peers are talking a lot without truly saying anything today. With the perceptive insight your sign is known for, Scorpio, you might be able to tell when someone is holding back. Asking them directly what's on their mind could scare them off, but starting a more general discussion could give them space to carefully approach the topic of concern. Having an idea of what's going on may give you peace, even if you don't know all the details.","One of your relationships, perhaps with someone you live with, could be going through a growth spurt now. If you already share space with them, you might wonder if it makes sense to share other resources with them too. However, even if you have generous motivations, you may be better off taking things more slowly. You probably would be better served by keeping things that are just yours, so let your collaboration develop further before you expand it to include anything else.","You may be trying to get a clearer sense of your own identity now, but being spread too thin with a variety of responsibilities could still leave you feeling scattered. Talking with someone you trust may help you decide which of your obligations you can get away with dropping. While you might be caught up in the details of what you have to do and when you have to do it, the big picture may be more clearly visible from the outside.","Expressing yourself may be more frustrating than fulfilling today, as you might be chewing on some thoughts that aren't quite ready to be aired to those around you. For the time being, you could be better off pursuing some less complicated pleasures, like clearing out your to-do list. This practical approach might distract you from any heavy topics on your mind -- and you may also see whatever problems you've been working on more clearly after taking a temporary break from them.","Peer pressure could be an intense force for you at this time, and you might feel particularly embarrassed if your home or family life seems to fall short of the group's standards. However, the more important question is probably whether or not your domestic situation works well for you! If you've had an unexpectedly good outcome from doing something a bit unconventional, others might benefit from hearing about your experience. Fortunately, you may currently be better equipped than usual to tell your story."
2022-01-16,"Our craving for security may push us to find innovative solutions. This is encouraged by the sensitive Cancer Moon's sextile to inventive Uranus this morning. That said, the Moon's opposition to relationship-oriented Venus could suggest that simply leaving our metaphorical cocoons would be a better approach than trying to change them. Although building walls to protect our egos may be tempting when the powerful Sun meets withholding Pluto at 9:51 am EST, being honest about our needs can get us satisfying results without manipulating others.","Making progress in your career may be rewarding for you at this time, but you could start to get the sense that disorganization at home is holding you back from doing even better. While shopping for the latest storage methods might tempt you, look at what you already have before you begin spending. You might already be able to arrange things you currently own in a more efficient way. Focusing on your major life goals can help you hone your efforts.","Vulnerability and power simultaneously exist within you, and today you might feel both of those qualities impacting your life. Even though you may be aware of the good that your political or spiritual views can do when implemented in the world, even you could be a little intimidated by how intensely your convictions can shake up your life. If you can be truthful about this tension you might be experiencing, the people you talk to may find your perspective more relatable.","Feeling vulnerable about your finances could provoke you to reach out for help at the moment. You might actually get the assistance you want, but try to be aware of what your prospective benefactor stands to gain from the arrangement. There doesn't have to be anything wrong with a transaction where everyone benefits -- even so, make sure you can live with the strings attached before accepting anything. You may want privacy for your situation, but know the difference between appropriate discretion and unhealthy secrecy.","A close relationship could be stressful for you now, as you may feel like you have to choose between following your heart and being emotionally safe. It might seem as though the only way to stay at a level of risk you find acceptable is to separate from this friend or loved one. However, someone else with whom you have a less intense relationship could be able to give you another perspective on the situation. A better solution might be visible from the outside.","You may take pride in checking things off your to-do list today, but working hard could still tire you out after a while. Instead of forcing yourself to push ahead no matter what, see whether or not you have permission to take a break. Any authority figures that you're concerned about might be more lenient than you expect. If it turns out that the only person who has a problem with you getting some rest is you, you may need to reset your expectations!","You may be eager to impress your friends with what you've been up to lately, especially if you've done something fun and creative. Their reaction might not be exactly what you expect, but try to resist the urge to push them to see things your way. If you give them space to share their unique perspective, you may learn that you remind them of an author or other creator you hadn't heard of before. Following up on that recommendation could be good for you!","Home life could frustrate you at the moment, as you might feel like you must decide between having things the way you want them and having peace with everyone else. If you give others more space to go their own way, you may actually be pleasantly surprised with the results! There are no guarantees, whether or not you're in charge of things at home, but knowing that people are working with you because they want to be there can increase your feelings of security.","You may have a lot on your mind these days -- fortunately, sharing some of it with someone close to you could be good for your relationship. Though you might be worried about how they'll react to your thoughts on a controversial topic or situation, you may be able to keep things calm by being honest about what you don't know. In that kind of trusting atmosphere, the other person may feel comfortable enough to fill some of the gaps in your knowledge.","You may feel like you have a lot of money right now, which could make you a little dangerous. If someone comes to you wanting financial assistance, you might see how having them indebted to you would work in your favor. However, following this impulse may lead to drama down the line. You're probably better off limiting yourself to exchanges that are balanced in the moment, but you can still remain open to the possibility of creative transactions like trading favors or services for funds.","You may be trying to portray a serious and dignified image today, but someone close to you could throw off your vibe by acting rather immature. Instead of pressuring them to fit your mold, reflect on why this person is in your life. Sometimes opposites attract because they need each other! While they may be drawn to your stability, sometimes their sense of fun is probably good for you. This could be one of those times, so you might want to follow their lead.","Keeping a secret could be harder than you expected today. Even though it may be a generally happy secret, like your plans for a surprise party for someone close to you, some unexpectedly difficult work might be necessary to prevent the truth from getting out ahead of schedule. Changing your basic activities at home might reveal more clues than you think to others who are familiar with your routine, so you may be better off finding a reason to leave the house.","The energy of a community you belong to could be quite intense at this time. While being involved with this group may seem to increase your social status, listen to your own intuition about whether you really feel secure there. If you can safely talk to a member of the group about your concerns, that could be a sign things are generally on the right track. On the other hand, if questions aren't welcome, they might not have your best interests at heart."
2022-01-17,"Ordinary activities may take on more importance than usual. Our perception is heightened as the thoughtful Moon in Cancer sends vibes to visionary Neptune and powerful Pluto today. When the Full Moon strikes at 6:48 pm EST, things could get emotional! It might become apparent that the rigid structures of our lives need to soften to work with the humans who live in them. Near the end of the day, the Moon enters flamboyant Leo, eager to help us recognize each other as unique individuals.","You may feel vulnerable to an oppressive authority figure today. Whether or not you succeed in getting your way with them, you could benefit from reflecting on messages you received about this type of dynamic when you were younger. If you secretly believe that you get some kind of moral benefit from being the underdog, it might be hard for you to assert yourself in a way that would undermine that. Others may hold you back sometimes, but don't help them do it!","Conversations with the people around you could be unexpectedly intense today. You might discover that someone else's beliefs are not what you thought they were! Happily, rather than feeling disappointed or misled, you may be secretly relieved to find this out. Seeing that others can be flexible could give you the permission you need to let yourself adapt to changing conditions. Regardless of how loyal you might feel to what you learned in the past, you also need to live in the present.","Learning about money matters can be productive for you today, but the facts you discover may be an unpleasant surprise -- at least at first. You could learn that an investment or other arrangement that you're involved in isn't working as well for you as you want. If you feel like you've been manipulated or treated unfairly, reaching out to an authority figure could be helpful. Even if they don't watch things too closely, they may be able to act when most needed.","You may have reached your limit for being able to just go along with things in a close partnership. It might usually make sense to let the other person take the lead for whatever reason -- that said, you could now feel like you finally have to assert yourself. Confronting them may not be easy, but making sure that you're acting in line with your beliefs about the world could get you the support you need and help you feel less alone overall.","Insight about what motivates one of your habits could come to you at any moment. While the habit itself is probably fine, going about it in a rigid or compulsive way might alienate others who come in contact with or are affected by your routine. If you get a better sense of why you do what you do, you may be able to thoughtfully rework things so that you get more of the benefits you want and remove some burdens from others.","The way that you're perceived in a community you belong to might surprise you. You may be confident that your method of doing things works well for you, but you could also have trouble noticing when you've crossed the line into throwing your weight around with others. Someone close, whether personally or professionally, may give you a needed perspective on things you can't see yourself. Even if it isn't what you want to hear, it could give you a lot to think about.","Drama at home could engross you right now, to the point it might surprise you that the outside world isn't as caught up in it as you are. Whether you want control or someone else is pushing you around, getting a different perspective may be quite helpful. Ask yourself how the actions of everyone involved would be perceived in another context, like professional life. Although home can be a place to relax boundaries, that doesn't mean there shouldn't be any boundaries at all.","You may not be satisfied with shallowness in your routine conversations today. While you might wonder how a little chat got so deep seemingly out of nowhere, opening up to another person could help you resolve an intellectual dilemma you've been chewing on lately. Staying loyal to your beliefs may be important to you, but you might also need to be more flexible. Figuring out what is negotiable and what is not can help you adapt to changing times while still being true to yourself.","An opportunity to contribute your resources toward a home or family situation in an idealistic way could arrive on your doorstep and look like it's your big chance to be the change you want to see in the world right now. No matter how enticing this is, be careful to give only what you can afford. Overstretching yourself could lead to resentment if things don't work out the way you want. Take some time and create a good plan to match your good intentions!","You may think you're able to control how the world views you, but currently, someone else could see things that you'd prefer to keep hidden. Of course, not everything you hide is necessarily bad! It might simply be that you have a softer side that you're afraid will get hurt if you let it out. If the other person is kind enough to share their observations with you discreetly, that could show you that deepening your relationship with them would be worthwhile.","Going through your daily routine could be frustrating today, as tasks that seem like they should be straightforward may rub someone else's sensitivities the wrong way. You might need to get your nose out of your to-do list and hear out the person who is offended. They may have a legitimate grievance that's easy to fix once you learn all the details of the situation. However, if they seem to prefer the power of being offended, there might be nothing you can do.","Losing yourself in a friend group or community might work reasonably well for you at this time. You may find it a relief to let someone else be the one who makes tough decisions that you can then quietly go along with. That's OK, but make sure you are handling this surrender of your responsibility in a way that's fair to everyone involved! If you want others to take the fall when things go wrong, you can't claim all the credit when things go right."
2022-01-18,"Progress may be necessary, but it isn't always peaceful. Uranus, bringer of change, turns direct at 10:27 am EST to continue the revolution. Later, the dramatic Moon in Leo opposes idealistic Mercury and squares Uranus, forming a tense configuration called a T-square. While we might try to use logic to convince ourselves that our ideas work, our emotional reactions could show us otherwise. We can recover by remembering that emotions are just another type of information that we should take into consideration.","Hearing innovative ideas from your friends or people on social media could inspire you to try a new way of making money today. Even though your sources might be on to something, letting yourself fall immediately into fantasizing about getting rich quick is probably a bigger risk than any particular opportunity that you find appealing. Most investments worth pursuing can -- and should -- survive a little time spent thinking about them before you jump in, so do your research and make a plan.","You could find yourself as the person who shakes things up at the moment, even if that's not how you usually see yourself. This might frustrate your family or loved ones, though you may simply be reacting against feeling micromanaged. You can respect attention to detail, but not when it's out of touch with how things work in the real world. In a situation like this, the practical approach your sign is known for can seem more revolutionary than you might think.","Paying attention to hidden things may help you solve a complicated problem today -- but applying this fix could be easier than actually explaining to others how you did it. You may still have to protect some secrets, and even if you don't, putting an elaborate idea into words can be challenging in its own way. You might feel bad if someone harasses you for information that you just can't share, but as long as the work gets done, everything should turn out fine.","You may have always assumed you knew how you would handle a particular difficult situation if it happened to you. Hearing from a friend who has actually experienced that specific challenge could suddenly make it less theoretical for you. While your hypothetical ideas might have provided a tidy answer, watching your friend negotiate a murky reality could show you that things aren't so simple. You might feel down on yourself for having seen it differently in the past, but focus on being supportive going forward.","Your professional life may have been on a roll lately, but today's events could reveal that your personal relationships haven't caught up to your new role in the world. If it becomes obvious that someone close to you is still working from an outdated view of you, they might need to be corrected. During any delicate communication around that, try to separate any sensitive feelings about your metamorphosis from whatever they said! Change isn't easy, and handling it in a dramatic way just makes it harder.","Your intellectual life could be buzzing today, as you may encounter a new book or website that really makes you think. Though you might be seriously excited, you may need to take some time alone to make sure you fully understand the details of the basic idea before you try explaining it to others. Reviewing it in a methodical way can also help you find holes in the narrative, if there are any. Trust your passion, but remember to verify the facts.","An organization or community you care about could ask for your financial support today. While you may be aware that they do important work, you might need to balance your desire to help them with the capacity of your budget. However, be on the lookout for an unconventional way of collaborating with them! Even if you can't give them exactly what they're asking for, there may be something else you can contribute -- consider doing some volunteer work or donating other materials.","Power dynamics in your family may not be what you expect at this time. Regardless of how much the logic and facts involved favor your side, it could seem that someone else's emotions hold greater sway. Trying to make them follow your rules may only frustrate you, but directly asking them what they want the rules to be could lead to a more interesting outcome. Giving them the opportunity to explain their strategy out loud might provoke them to reconsider it.","The people around you may have an obnoxious number of questions about a new diet or routine that you're pursuing these days. Of course, you probably aren't obligated to tell them everything they want to know! On the other hand, admitting that you don't know the answer to some questions could actually help you. You may be stuck trying to concoct elaborate justifications for your choices, but if the truth is that you're just doing what feels good for you, then you should own it!","Financial clarity is actually possible at this time! That said, if someone close to you makes an emotional plea for money, you could be tempted to toss your careful planning and give in to their request. Before you open your wallet, ask yourself if money is really the biggest challenge between the two of you. If there is an established dynamic where you always defer to them, no matter what, standing up for yourself could clear the air and improve this relationship in the future.","Changes at home could be exciting for you now, but others involved may not share your view of the situation. You might need to hear out someone else who seems needy or emotional. Even if you think they shouldn't be reacting to things that way, you can't control how they feel -- plus, they could have some valid points that you haven't considered. Finding a way to address at least some of their grievances may help heal any tension in your relationship with them.","Using your words to shock people might be really tempting for you today. If you absolutely can't hold back from telling a secret, at least make sure you have all of the details right before you spill it! Checking the facts could reveal that you misunderstood something along the way, perhaps because your misunderstanding supported what you already thought. It would be better to share the whole truth, no matter how dramatic the story you wanted to tell could have been."
2022-01-19,"Finding our own voices amidst the world's noise may be challenging today. The pace-setting Sun enters social Aquarius at 9:39 pm EST, encouraging us to connect with each other -- but it could be difficult to balance our personal needs with what's best for the group. The individualistic Moon in Leo faces a disappointing opposition from stern Saturn, plus awkward nudges from harmony-seeking Venus and idealistic Neptune to try and keep the peace, but tolerating uncomfortable conversations might be good for us in the long run.","Some peer pressure could be stressing you out right now! The powerful Sun enters your 11th House of Friendships and Community today to turn up the heat. Although the group can ultimately work with you rather than against you, you might have to assert yourself first. Whatever frustrations you experience now are most likely stemming from people being too caught up in their own stuff to notice how they come off to you, and hearing your concerns could help them shape up.","Keeping track of all of the big ideas swirling around in your head could be challenging for you now. As the dynamic Sun moves into your 10th House of Career today, you need to minimize distractions so you can focus on your major goals. One way to thin the herd of your ideas might be implementing some of them in your home life. Any theories that don't work in practice are ones you can remove from your list of things to think about.","The need to talk to someone about your beliefs may have been brewing for a while, and it might finally come out today. Major differences in how you two see the world could really matter -- especially if the other person is deeply embedded in the logistics of your life. You may want to look at the possibility that you'd find the ideological disagreement more bearable if you had more space from them. Too much togetherness can be hard regardless of your views!","You may have high hopes for combining finances or other resources in a significant relationship of yours, but taking the first steps toward this goal could be a revealing moment. Bringing this collaboration from something in your head to something that exists in real life might shock you more than you expect. Finding the right balance between feeling committed and feeling trapped can be hard, so be aware of your reactions at this point. If anyone involved needs more personal freedom, make adjustments accordingly.","Socializing could feel a little exhausting if it seems like everyone wants something from you. As the illuminating Sun enters your 7th House of Relationships today, you might take this opportunity to develop a clearer view of what exactly you're willing to give to others. When you are fully aware of your limits, you can relax a bit and stop waiting on the edge to see where someone will push you next. You may even find you begin to enjoy having company again!","Sacrificing yourself for relationships might seem appealing for you right now, but you could end up feeling burned out. You may be concerned that people love you for what you do rather than for who you are. If you start to spiral, ask yourself if this perception is based more on the behavior of others or on your own thoughts. You might want to take some space to rest and reflect by yourself in order to gain the needed perspective on the situation.","You may see yourself as a rock of stability maintaining peace at home and at work. If a friend asks how you're REALLY doing, though, you might start letting out everything you've been holding inside. Venting could feel great in the moment, but you may still wonder how to solve any underlying problems. The relaxed atmosphere of friendship might be a hint! If you enjoy your friends without feeling responsible for them, you could try carrying this attitude into your other relationships.","Deciding what to do with your life might seem like an overwhelming task at the moment. However, the things around you that you take for granted may give you some clues toward a direction that would be fulfilling for you. Read your room like a detective encountering it for the first time, and try to figure out what kind of person lives there and what they might enjoy. Your curious Scorpio nature could help you rediscover a part of yourself that you may have forgotten!","Recent dreams about improving your home might at last be ready to move from mere possibilities to real plans. Talking with others involved in the situation at the moment is definitely necessary, although they might be focused on different parts of it than you are. Try not to get frustrated if they bring up too many questions that seem petty to you. While your efforts to grasp the big picture are important, the details will ultimately be needed to fill in that picture.","Having confidence in yourself, as well as being able to communicate in a way that stirs the idealism of others, could help you find someone willing to invest in you at this time. As you turn your focus to getting assistance from others, don't totally forget about the resources you already have! You may be considering the possibility that your prospective benefactors would be more sympathetic to you if you seemed less well-off, but just focus on portraying the truth, whatever that is.","An opportunity to focus on yourself might fall into your lap today. As the radiant Sun enters your sign, a powerful encounter with someone else could kick off this Aquarius season by giving you an idea of which parts of yourself you need to understand better. While you may be drawn to defining your identity and making clear statements about who you are, you might also need to remain aware that some experiences of yours don't easily fit into any labels or boxes.","Checking things off your to-do list could be good for you right now. No matter which specific tasks are on it, simply getting stuff done in general may help you shake off some potential distractions that have left you feeling scattered. You might especially want to focus on making your personal space clean and free of clutter. As the almighty Sun enters your 12th House of Contemplation today, giving yourself room to relax could be rewarding both now and in the future."
2022-01-20,"Our enthusiasm may wake us up early this morning! The Moon in flamboyant Leo makes a great alarm as it forms an encouraging trine with active Mars. The vibe on this high-energy day might shift into something more realistic as Luna moves into detail-oriented Virgo at 9:02 am EST. We can still be visionary and optimistic when the Moon goes on to oppose exuberant Jupiter, but staying in touch with our practical side can help us direct our passion toward accomplishing things that will last.","The idea of pursuing an adventure where you get to see new places or learn new things may be very exciting for you now. Unfortunately, figuring out the practical details of how to make it happen could be more difficult. If there isn't an obvious answer to your logistical or financial frustrations right away, don't lose heart! Help could come from a hidden or unexpected source, so trust that things will work out if your dream is meant to take place.","Some financial support for a major goal could come from your family at this time. However, they might not quite understand the details of what you're doing or why it's important. This kind of specific emotional validation may have to come from your peers who are following the same or similar paths to your own. Cultivating the support network that you need is a good step for you now, but keep in mind that different people will help you in different ways.","You may be tired of waiting for others to read your mind today -- which could be a really good thing. If a personal or professional relationship isn't all you want it to be at the moment, you have the power to start a big conversation and change whatever is unsatisfying. You may especially benefit from entering the interaction with a clear idea of what you want the other person to do about a situation where you feel a lack of security.","Taking care of your possessions may be a priority for you today. Though cleaning or maintenance might produce immediately satisfying results once you make the effort to do it, the benefits you experience could be bigger than that. As you pay attention to what you own, you can also develop better ways to organize your space. Giving yourself easy access to the things you actually use in your daily routines can make your life more comfortable in a practical way.","Actively seeking pleasure can be a worthy pursuit for you right now. While you might worry that this is selfish, a wholehearted embrace of your own needs and desires can, in the long run, inspire you to be more generous toward those around you. When you are at your best, you likely want everyone else to feel good too. Do what makes you happy for now, but be on the lookout for opportunities to help others follow their bliss as well.","The people in your life might be important to you, but you probably have your own personal space to take care of too. Allowing yourself enough downtime to start your day in an organized way, perhaps with a little cleaning up around the house, can give you the mental energy to be fully present for your loved ones later. You'll be able to enjoy a good conversation better when you aren't distracted with your to-do list running in the back of your mind.","Information you need could arrive through an easy flow of communication you have with your social network today. Your sign is not known to enjoy making decisions, so crowdsourcing a necessary choice might be tempting. Even so, it may be necessary at some point for you to shut off the spigot of chatter and sort through everything you've taken in by yourself. There is a limit to how much advice is useful, so try to be aware of when you begin to feel overwhelmed.","Your passion to make more money could be strong at this time. Although this may motivate you to pour effort into your current career, you might also be open to finding additional income streams. Fortunately, a friend, or someone you follow on social media, could have a tip of that sort for you. Do your own research before you act on it, but you might have a good eye now for which speculative investments or alternative work styles are likely to work out.","You may be in touch with your desires now, and this could inspire you to shift some of your basic ideas about the world. While there is a risk you might adopt a self-serving view to justify something you were going to do anyway, the benefits of making a needed adjustment to your attitude toward authority probably outweigh that. You will always have to contend with the limits of reality, but there is no need to defer to boundaries that aren't real.","You might be working hard behind the scenes to get your life in order right now. A prime target for your energy at the moment could be complicated financial stuff like taxes, insurance claims, or investments. While you may not know everything you need to know at this point, your grasp might be solid enough that you can at least ask the right questions. The answers you receive could be exactly what makes your understanding of the big picture finally click into place.","A group that you're part of may demand a lot of effort from you at this time, but your personal connection to the other members can make the work bearable. That said, you may notice if your friends don't seem as into it as you are. Although it is important to respect that people bring different abilities and resources to the situation, you might need to dial back your own intensity if you feel resentful about the contributions of others.","Your professional ambition could motivate you to work hard today. However, don't forget the people who have helped you get to where you are. Nurturing your professional relationships can remind you, in a comforting way, that it's not all about you! Reconnecting with someone in your network could help you discover that you have a potential opportunity to offer them. It will likely feel great to support them -- especially if you're returning the favor for something they've done for you."
2022-01-21,"Practicality and beauty can go hand in hand today. This is especially true when the reserved Virgo Moon trines traditional Venus in Capricorn at 8:19 am EST. However, we might need to know when to stop doing things the way we've always done them. Some awkward energy between the sensitive Moon and both wounded Chiron and frustrating Saturn can show us what isn't working. If we take these messages seriously, the Moon's trine to innovative Uranus may help us make the changes that we need.","Your suspicions that your peers don't respect your work could get you feeling down on yourself today. It may be hard for you to distinguish your own frustrations from the signals others are actually putting out, as you might not be entirely objective about your own performance. Try to see your job in a fuller context. If you're earning the money you need and learning skills that can advance your career, things are probably going better for you than you think!","Doing something fun and relaxing could be worthwhile for you today. Although you may worry that you shouldn't slack off from your responsibilities, taking your nose off the grindstone for a moment might actually be quite educational. If you go beyond your normal boundaries, seeing things you don't normally see can really stimulate your mind. The things you learn by doing something new could give you exactly the insight you need to solve a problem you have been wrestling with lately.","You could learn a surprising secret about a loved one or close friend today. Though you may be grateful that they trusted you enough to open up, you also might not know what to do with the new information. Retreating to a private place can give you room to reflect on what to do next. You may worry that your peers will judge you harshly for associating with someone controversial, but try to keep this concern separate from determining what your loved one needs.","Connecting with your broader social network could go well for you now, as you're likely to be able to turn an acquaintance into a closer friend. You may bond over having surprisingly similar frustrations involving your careers. Sharing too much too soon can be a risk when you suddenly feel understood, so try to stay attuned to the other person's comfort level. If you work to build a harmonious connection now, you may have opportunities in the future to communicate on a deeper level.","You may feel like you aren't living up to your own expectations of how much money you should be making at this point in your life. While this type of judgment isn't always a helpful force, the current moment might be the right time to take another close look at your finances. Even if you are generally on the right track in your career, you may be able to make some adjustments in that area to get paid what you're really worth.","A new way of understanding your priorities could help you feel free today. Your responsibilities and your commitments to others might still be important to you, but you may need to bring them into a more stable balance with everything else that matters. When you take care of yourself, the others you're intertwined with will also benefit from your more relaxed attitude. Try to be aware of how your own feelings of stress and resentment can leak out and contaminate an entire situation.","Time spent alone can be productive for you today. Though you may feel inhibited from expressing yourself in some of your relationships, you might benefit from at least gathering your thoughts on a complicated topic. This can be good groundwork to complete, in case you do wind up discussing things with others later. Without the fear of judgment holding you back in the moment, you may be able to see the situation more clearly and come up with a truly innovative solution.","Matchmaking could sound like a fun way to spend your day, as you may be able to see how one of your friends or separate groups of friends would benefit from knowing another. Saying the right words to make it happen probably won't be difficult -- thinking about how shifting the established boundaries could affect your friendships might require more effort! You probably can't predict everything, but having a general idea of how change might trigger your insecurities can help you weather any surprises.","Following the money can help you make a good decision in your career at this time. If you're stuck in a loop of deliberating about how some work that isn't what you expected may not fit with your sense of self, you might be making things more complicated than they need to be. Though you could be concerned about having to explain your situation to others, they might be more understanding and less insistent on getting an explanation than you imagine.","Pleasure could be a complicated experience for you today. While your background might have left you feeling like you must be productive every single second to justify your existence, appreciating the way you feel when you take a more relaxed approach could give you permission to rethink things. Think about reading what someone else has written on this subject! That can help you feel less alone and potentially give you a new authority figure to replace the destructive one lurking inside your head.","Unsnarling a detailed money matter, like something to do with taxes or insurance, could go well for you now. The most challenging part may be keeping your own ego out of the way, especially if you have to collaborate with a partner or family member on solving the problem. Fears about your security, though understandable, could block you from seeing the best option. If you can try looking at the situation like an outsider would, that might help you make a thoughtful decision.","Being seen in a generally positive light in your community may be easy for you to do right now, but you might crave to be understood on a more personal level. You can have both today, but you may have to take a risk to reach out for the connection you want. While your inhibitions could leave you feeling shut down across the board, taking your fears with a grain of salt might help you identify the opportunities that are likely to be fulfilling."
2022-01-22,"Fights may be dangerously easy to pick today. The finicky Virgo Moon may be inciting them as it squares aggressive Mars. Instead of responding to every irritation, we could use the Moon's trine with penetrating Pluto to reach deep insights about what's really bothering us. A second wind of energy could arrive when Luna, by then in Libra, makes a friendly trine with the lively Sun at 10:43 pm EST. The Moon trines chatty Mercury even later, so getting to sleep could be difficult.","You may be frustrated that someone else doesn't seem to be following the rules of a routine activity today. However, you might need to take into account the power dynamics of the situation, where the rules, in practice, seem different for some people than they are for others. Asking friends for advice on the situation could be helpful for you. While you may be locked into a specific view based on some of your personal relationships, they might have a larger perspective.","Someone close may want you to spend the day working on a shared obligation with them, but you could be really drawn to do your own thing instead. You are better off being truthful about your needs instead of going along resentfully, but perhaps you can make a compromise where you get some time for having fun as well as doing practical work. If you can bear to focus on something boring -- especially later today -- you might actually be good at it.","Quiet may be appealing to you now, but someone else might insist on engaging with you. If you can't persuade them to wait until another time, try to steer the conversation straight to their deeper concerns. You'll probably be less annoyed by a surprisingly intense conversation than by chatter that just seems to pointlessly disturb your peace. Letting this kind of interruption in could end up giving you a worthy tidbit that will inspire you to pursue further intellectual exploration on your own.","Communicating about routine tasks could frustrate you today. Although you may just be trying to get things done correctly, you might wind up hurting someone else's feelings, which could in turn hurt your feelings. It would be wise to take a break from the task and focus on your relationship with the other person, because the fight is probably not really about what set it off. With patience, you might come to deeper insights that will definitely be worth the trouble.","Your passion for fun might be straining your budget at the moment. The current need to look at your finances, however, could motivate you to figure out a way to get more money from your work, allowing you to increase your income as well as reduce your expenses. In the meantime, having a good conversation with someone close might let you enjoy yourself without breaking the bank. Remembering your wealth of relationships can help you get perspective on your money frustrations.","Exasperation could provoke you to snap at whoever is around you at home today. If you can push yourself to look within rather than focus on how others are annoying you, you may be able to make an important insight about which need of yours isn't being met at this time. Taking practical action to meet this need can help you regain a sense of control over your life. After you make progress in this regard, others may seem less irritating to you.","You may think you're keeping some current frustrations to yourself, but they could emerge in passive-aggressive speech. Consider the possibility that your snarky remarks make you sound just like a parent or other caretaker who shaped your youth. You have an opportunity to learn how to express yourself in a more productive way going forward, and understanding how you developed your present approach could be the key to unraveling it. If it comes from fear, confronting that fear can build the confidence you need.","You could have tension with your friends at this time, as they may seem to be insulting your deeply held values. However, it might be hard for you to determine what's truly setting you off about whatever they did or said. You may get a better chance at clarity if you step away from the situation and spend some time alone to reflect. When you are in touch with your own foundation, others might not be able to rattle it as easily.","Asserting yourself could be frustrating today, as you might seem to offend an authority figure no matter how innocent your intentions are. Perhaps you triggered a sensitivity of theirs about money that you didn't know was there. It's also possible that you would be perceived as offensive no matter what you did, as they might view you as a threat to their power. You may want to run the situation by some friends for their take on whether or not you objectively did anything wrong.","No matter how subtly you present yourself, you can still give quiet hints of any personal beliefs that shape your life. While you may be frustrated that it doesn't seem appropriate for you to be more vocal about your views, an indirect approach may be more persuasive than you realize. If you can't resist commenting openly, though, the financial or logistical aspects of a cause you're concerned about may be less controversial and more compelling than other potential arguments in your favor.","A friend may push you too hard on a personal subject where you would prefer privacy today. Though you have the right to keep some things to yourself, this encounter might provoke you to wrestle with the idea that you're genuinely interested in sharing your views on the topic at hand. As long as you get to control the way you tell the story and which information you include, you may realize your words have the potential to help others.","Ambition could be hard on your personal life at the moment, as someone close to you might feel like you're neglecting them in favor of your work. Though you may be grateful for other friends who are more understanding of your limited availability, you might miss seeing everyone frequently. You may need to rework some of your obligations in order to give yourself more time with everyone who matters to you. Don't forget to include your own downtime in your calculations!"
2022-01-23,"Thoughts may come to us at an electric pace today. We can thank the intellectual Mercury in innovative Aquarius meeting the bright Sun at 5:28 am EST for that. Meanwhile, the balanced Moon in Libra forms a trine with practical Saturn, helping us identify which of our brainstorms are most likely to succeed. The Moon also challenges status-seeking Venus, suggesting that we may need to let go of time-honored ways of doing things if pursuing an opportunity for change will actually make us more secure.","Joining a new community to explore exciting ideas might seem like a great opportunity at the moment. However, you may worry that following this impulse would make a respected authority figure think less of you. While your concern about status shouldn't stop you from joining, this group's detractors could have a point. An unhealthy or cult-like dynamic might be a valid reason to avoid that crowd! If the only problem seems to be unfair prejudice, though, reaching out to them might be good for you.","Adventure may call to you now, but you might wonder how to get that when you feel like you must stick to your daily responsibilities. Fortunately, your routine work could turn out to be more exciting than normal! You may find yourself in the role of bringing order to chaos, but at the same time, you might enjoy the disruption enough to not be too resentful about it. Today's challenges can ultimately invigorate you and give you an opportunity to take pride in your skills.","You may have the support you need from others to take some time for yourself today. The best way to use this opportunity could be to construct a thoughtful self-care routine that you can implement going forward. Others have probably dealt with some of your frustrations, such as having trouble finding the time to do everything you need to do, so try reading up on their experiences. Once you understand their strategy, you can adapt what they have written to your own unique challenges.","You may understand that your home life requires sharing resources with others, and today you might need to turn your attention to reworking the details of whatever arrangement you have. However, your home also needs to be a place where you can rest. As you take care of anything truly urgent, know your limits. Another person may want to have a big conversation about other interpersonal relationships, but that might need to wait for another day when you have more energy for it.","Taking a break from your responsibilities to have a long conversation with someone important might be worthwhile for you today. Their perspective could really intrigue you. Though you may have to intensely focus to keep track of their potentially long story, it might ultimately put into words a complicated feeling that you've been trying to pin down for some time. With your own thoughts better organized, you could find you have a clearer mind whenever you do get back to work.","Taking a risk to make money could tempt you right now, especially if you otherwise feel blocked from improving your financial status. Even if your risk turns out to be successful, that doesn't rule out the need for you to look at your budget as a whole. You may also be able to get more money than you think out of your regular and predictable work. It might not be an improvement on the scale of winning the lottery, but every little bit helps!","You may discover that what you find beautiful today is different from the idea of beauty you were raised with. Even if you have already been drifting in this direction for some time, being able to clearly articulate what you do and don't like in the moment can help you make decisions more easily about how you'll style yourself going forward. Once you have the idea of a general style you want, you may really enjoy shopping for some of the specific items.","An exhausting amount of activity could be going on in your home life at this time, and you might feel like the frenetic atmosphere generally lacks sympathy for your need to rest. People who mean well may want to talk to you about whatever is driving the chaos, but if you're not really in the mood to talk, then you're better off being honest. A story worth telling might emerge after the dust settles, but trying to share it now may be too frustrating.","It might come out now that a friend you care about doesn't share your values on an important topic. If you want to preserve the friendship regardless, you may need to talk to them about why you like having them in your life. While a long history can't necessarily save all relationships, it can be an important factor for both of you in this case. You might want to keep in mind that you've weathered other storms of this sort before.","A get-rich-quick scheme might be appealing to you today, especially if you feel like the progress you're making with your career is too slow for your comfort. It's not necessarily a bad idea to have multiple income streams, but be honest with yourself about how much energy you have to put toward a side gig. You aren't going to get something for nothing no matter how you try to make money, so you might consider putting more effort into your current profession instead.","It could surprise you that everyone seems to suddenly want your opinion right now, even though you've had the same public opinion all along. Fortunately, you may be able to express your perspective more eloquently than usual today. If you can stay focused on the big picture instead of getting lost in the details of your ideas, you might be able to win some supporters. They may not be willing to make their agreement public right away, though, so try and be patient with them.","Unraveling a complicated issue of shared property or finances may require you to be more honest than you'd prefer at this time. The possible judgment from your peers regarding whatever information you're holding back is probably not as bad as you imagine! However, you still have a right to prefer privacy in almost every situation. You can make it clear to the person you're dealing with that you want your details to be handled with discretion, and proceed according to their response."
2022-01-24,"Efficient plans could excite us at the moment! Active Mars enters determined Capricorn at 7:53 am EST, giving us a productive burst of energy. However, even our most well-planned schemes might get temporarily derailed by unexpected hurt feelings when the impressionable Moon in optimistic Libra squares withholding Pluto. Luckily, once Luna enters intense Scorpio, she'll be able to work harmoniously with Mars. We may discover our emotions can guide our actions in helpful ways as long as we accept even the difficult ones.","Your professional ambition may be too much for one of your close relationships now. It's OK to feel bad if the other person makes a snarky dig about how you never have time for them anymore, but try not to spiral into feeling like you have completely failed. After you take some time to calm down from any provocations, you may be able to talk things out with them. Deep honesty can help the two of you address your real issues.","Work may demand a lot from you at this time. You could find the effort that you're putting in becomes more bearable if you have an idea of what you're working toward. Making plans with someone close to go on a trip or take a class together might be just what you need to remind you that you still have a personal life! If you don't know who to plan on going with, flying solo could give you the opportunity to meet new friends.","You might want to focus on yourself today, but your responsibilities to another person in your life could get in the way. While you may feel resentful about that intrusion on your schedule, you might be able to get into a really productive groove once you start working on the task at hand. Even if it isn't as much fun as whatever else you had in mind, you may wind up proud that you can cross it off your to-do list.","Insisting that anyone living with you should do things your way could be a recipe for tension at this time. Instead, try supplying everyone with enough space to find their own style -- you may be pleasantly surprised at the results! It might turn out that you're all closer to the same page than you expect. Getting most of what you want without a fight will be easier than dealing with a confrontation over trying to get every last bit of it.","You may be able to work hard today, but you might not want to talk about it. The more you try to politely answer someone who peppers you with questions, the more questions they could have for you. The best option might be to simply tell them right away that you need to work uninterrupted, because you're likely to snap sooner than they're likely to take a hint. When you feel like you can focus without being bothered, your productivity could soar.","Your desire to have fun might not go away just because you didn't make room for it in a carefully constructed budget. Things you don't acknowledge probably have ways of sabotaging your plans, so you may be better off being realistic about your need for pleasure. Talking to someone you trust can help you find the right balance between your competing priorities. While you must ultimately decide what works for you personally, hearing about the similar struggles of other people may be reassuring.","Asserting yourself could be irritating today, as it might seem like the requirements of someone else in your family are always more important than whatever you need. Fortunately, making an effort to actually solve your problems at home could go better than usual for you now. It may turn out that sometimes the cheapest way to deal with things is with money. Although watching your wallet makes sense, keep in mind that your time and your sanity are also limited and valuable resources.","Hiding what you want won't be easy right now. Determined Mars enters your 3rd House of Communication today, making you more than ready to be direct. The best results can be found by speaking clearly, as you're likely to come off sounding manipulative if you try to hold back any pertinent details. The people you're in contact with could respond favorably to a well-supported argument your desired goals will work wonderfully for them as well, so just go for it!","Spending money to keep up with your friends could be tempting for you now, as you may feel insecure if you see they have certain things you don't. As assertive Mars enters your 2nd House of Finances today, you might be better off taking some time alone to sort out how you can use your resources to achieve your own goals. Your needs might be different from those of whoever you're comparing yourself to, so learn to listen to your own voice.","Standing up for yourself should come easily today. However, you might be surprised to discover that a small part of yourself is still worried about status in a way you wouldn't expect or have forgotten about. It's OK to reach out to your friends to get some help shedding this inhibition. While you might not react well to being flippantly told to shake it off, just having someone hear out your concerns can let you reach a satisfying answer in your own way.","Working hard behind the scenes can currently win you the respect of people in authority. Though you may not get public recognition at the moment, you might be more influential than you realize in shaping the direction of whatever you're working on. Being aware of the impact you have can help you decide how to use it wisely. You may be able to thoughtfully set aside your own ego and make choices that will benefit everyone involved -- happily, ""everyone"" also includes you!","You may be motivated to take your commitments to friendships or organizations up a notch today! Powerful Mars enters your 11th House of Groups and urges you onward. Before you start working, try to devote some thought to what level of intensity you're really ready to deal with. Insisting on discussing very personal issues might be uncomfortable for everyone involved. However, initiating an intellectual or philosophical conversation could be just the right depth for you and your associates at the moment."
2022-01-25,"Excitement may be in the air today, but we'll likely enjoy the ruckus. The intense Moon in Scorpio tangles with the assertive Sun and wild Uranus in a contentious T-square configuration, so being mischievous could be hard to avoid. However, Luna also forms friendlier aspects with harmonious Venus and fortunate Jupiter, so we might somehow end up seeming nice. Meanwhile, intellectual Mercury, still retrograde, moves back into practical Capricorn at 10:05 pm EST, so we can work to bring structure to any wild brainstorms.","A financial matter may be dragging you down at the moment, but some parts of the story that you thought were resolved might not be. An authority figure could change their mind in a way that benefits you, perhaps inspired by recent events in the news. Be alert and make yourself aware of what you need to do to take advantage of any shifts. It might involve something like completing additional paperwork, but the effort could be well worth it for you.","The most important journey for you right now might be one of self-knowledge. As wandering Mercury returns to your 9th House of Travel today, you may need to review your plans for an upcoming trip. Any misunderstandings can probably be resolved in your favor as long as you put in the effort. What you might have to work out on your own, though, is whether or not you still want to go. Ask yourself if what you want has substantially changed lately and act accordingly.","An unexpected disruption could throw off any careful efforts to get your schedule in order right now. As frustrating as that might be, you may need to accept the difference between true accidents and things you could have seen coming with more thoughtful attention. Other people might also be going through rough patches -- make an effort to accept everyone's limitations and keep your plans firmly grounded for now. Let your wilder pitches wait in the wings until things shift in your favor.","Drama within your friend group or a community of yours could affect you emotionally today. The group dynamic may be too out of control for you to get a word in, but talking to people one on one could be more productive. When you zoom out beyond the details to look at the big picture, you may be able to give thoughtful advice. Whether or not your suggestions are followed, you can find comfort in knowing that you did what you could.","Improving your routine may be a work in progress at the moment. If you aren't getting the results you need, you may need to talk to someone who seems to keep getting in your way and find out what they really want from you. A shift in your power dynamic with them could be long overdue -- they might even realize that while telling their side of the story. You should still be able to work with them on their more legitimate requests.","Telling people what's on your mind may tempt you more than usual at this time, but you might need to consider your audience. In the context of a close, supportive relationship, opening up can be a good thing. However, having coworkers or people you see for routine services know all of your personal views could make it harder for everyone involved to take care of business. Try to stop yourself before your friendly chitchat crosses the line into creating a dramatic distraction.","You may now find yourself pushed to the limit of your patience by an awkward arrangement for sharing resources. Though you might have put up with this for a long time because you thought you couldn't afford anything better, your situation could have changed since you last crunched the numbers. You may want to acknowledge any recent improvements or plausible developments you can see coming soon in your work life. That can help you feel secure and make a decision that meets your current needs.","Sweet talk may seem to help you be everything to everyone now. Although, as quick-thinking Mercury moves back into your 3rd House of Communication, people might start to remember promises you made to them in the past. If it becomes apparent that you can't follow through on your words, the resulting confrontation could be unexpectedly liberating. While getting called out may be uncomfortable in the moment, discovering your limits can help you develop enough self-respect to avoid similar mistakes going forward.","Hidden things could both help and harm you at this time. As messenger Mercury retrogrades back into your 2nd House of Finances, you might get a pleasant surprise -- perhaps by discovering money you had forgotten about. On the other hand, unexpected drama could pop up as you try to communicate about your routine work. You may accidentally step on someone else's unique sore spot that you had no way of knowing about in advance, but try to avoid wading into any obvious controversies.","Being true to your values could be important for you today, which might be surprising to your friends. They may not have guessed you felt that way about a particular issue, but you are more likely than normal to be able to express your point of view articulately. Even if you don't convince everyone to agree with you right away, you'll most likely feel at least a little relieved to have people know for sure where you stand instead of letting them assume or speculate.","Security may be hard to find at the moment, but blazing a new trail could be more rewarding for you anyway. The chaotic energy the whole world must contend with today is a good example of what it might be like to be you on a regular basis, so your ability to guide others through a moment of upheaval may be quite appreciated. Be patient with the anxiety of others. There might even be a financial reward in it for you!","You may find yourself getting some attention from your peers now, but make sure you use this opportunity for the highest good of everyone involved. Any gossip you indulge in has a greater chance than usual of getting out and causing trouble for you at this time. Fortunately, there is no need for you to sneak around and be manipulative. You can probably get what you want by simply asking for it! People will likely appreciate a refreshingly direct approach from you."
2022-01-26,"Our passionate emotions could have trouble finding an outlet this morning. The tempestuous Scorpio Moon may invite trouble as it squares cold Saturn at 12:42 am EST. Though forcing all that energy inward could be uncomfortable, having to sit with it may lead us to powerful insights. Luna also trines intuitive Neptune and sextiles penetrating Pluto, painting our personal concerns on a cosmic canvas. What we discover at this time might be bigger than we think it is, even if we can't put it into words.","Intense issues involving power dynamics could be on your mind at the moment, but sharing your thoughts with your friends might be a disappointing experience. You may have learned too many lessons the hard way from difficult encounters with authority figures throughout your life, and your knowledge could sound harsher than some people are prepared to hear. For you, knowing the truth is probably more liberating than depressing, but you may be better off savoring it in private for now.","Figuring out what others expect from you may be challenging at this time. It might seem like the social norms are vague enough that you have room to navigate in the way that makes the most sense to you, but be careful! You could get reprimanded for something you didn't think would be a problem. It's not always better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission. You can avoid trouble by asking someone you trust to help you understand the underlying logic.","Your responsibilities could seem exceptionally heavy today, but the way you think about them might be making them worse than they have to be. In the absence of clear direction from whoever is in charge, you may tend to assume the worst of things. Consider taking a look at how others handle similar tasks. If they're doing the same stuff with a lot less drama over the process, you may be able to benefit by adjusting your approach to match theirs.","Your current obligations to others could block any efforts to do something good for yourself. That said, the people you're worried about disappointing might be more understanding of your needs than you think! In the end, the main thing standing in your way right now may be your own overly idealistic view of yourself. When you let go of the belief that you can be everything to everyone, you can find more manageable ways to honor the responsibilities that are truly yours.","You might feel like you're just going through the motions in your current relationships with any housemates. Though part of you may crave more engagement or emotional warmth, you might also be relieved to have everyone else out of your hair while you focus on your own responsibilities. Acknowledging the quiet commitment that keeps you all together can help you feel supported, even if the support is not as demonstrative as you may want it to be at the moment.","Talking to someone significant about a confusing matter could go about as well as possible for you at this time. Even if you may come out of the conversation with more answers than you had before, you might still want more concrete details that the other person just can't give. Consider the possibility that this desire for specifics could be more about your own personality than about this situation! Try to engage productively with whatever facts they can share with you now.","Your budget may aggravate you at the moment, particularly if it doesn't seem to have room for a lot of fun. You may need to examine some of the basic building blocks you take for granted in your life. While your living situation and job might run smoothly enough, there could be things associated with those arrangements that are draining your resources in an unnecessary way. A small irritation today could help you notice -- and solve -- a potentially bigger issue!","Figuring out who you are and what you want could be hard right now, and you may want to find someone to blame for your feelings of frustration. A current situation might remind you of times when your family didn't understand you, especially early in your life, and you may wonder how your life would have been different if that hadn't happened. However, some thoughts might just take a long time to develop, no matter what anyone does. Be patient with your process.","Speaking your mind could be hard for you at the moment, as you may feel like you need to keep whatever is really bothering you private. It's OK if you need to take some time away from others and visit a place where you don't feel like you have to explain yourself. An activity like maintaining a collection of cherished possessions could lift your mood, in the sense that it may be comfortingly simpler than whatever you're unable to resolve your feelings about.","You might seem like a stick in the mud today, as far as an organization you belong to is concerned. While any concerns you may have about finances or other practical matters are probably valid, being vague about these issues in an attempt to sound kinder could just lead to someone misunderstanding you. You may not be able to make people understand the true depth of your commitment to your organization's cause, but you can give your feedback as clearly as possible.","Others may look to you for leadership today -- even the person who's actually in charge officially might lean on you for help! Even if you don't mind the opportunity to show your stuff, trouble could result if there is a mismatch between the responsibilities dumped on you and the power you're given to meet them. It may matter that you're still not technically the boss, so be careful not to overstep crucial boundaries. That might be difficult, but you can get through it!","You may really want to like a book or philosophy that all of your friends seem to be obsessed with, but you could find that you just can't get into it, no matter how much you try. Though you might feel left out of the excitement, this probably doesn't upset your friends as much as it upsets you. Vague and noncommittal responses should be sufficient to get you through most conversations about it until the fad passes, so just be patient."
2022-01-27,"Our dreams may seem closer than ever to reality today! We can thank the passionate Sagittarius Moon's square with exuberant Jupiter for that. Improbable things could actually work out now -- even the ideas that are too far out there can teach us valuable lessons with the help of the Moon's trine to sensitive Chiron. Our life force is strengthened when the Moon sextiles the bright Sun at 3:47 pm EST, fueling the pure joy of being alive within all of us.","A fascinating intellectual discussion with friends could be quite important for you now -- perhaps more than the other people involved realize. Something about yourself that you're ashamed of might seem less painful when you learn a different way of looking at it. You may or may not want to bring this revelation into your conversation with others, as it could be a bit of a tangent. You might want to continue contemplating your discovery on your own for a while.","The way you share money or property might be more stressful than it needs to be at the moment. Your embarrassment about a personal matter could be getting in the way of building the most functional arrangement possible for you. If you can muster the courage to be honest about your true needs, an authority figure might actually be on your side! It's probably possible to do this without looping in your whole social network, but even they may be kinder than you imagine.","Getting noticed for doing a good job at work could get you some new responsibilities. Even if you're flattered, you might be a little anxious about your ability to step up to the next level. Even if you don't feel afraid of looking stupid in front of your peers, confiding in someone you trust about the gaps in your knowledge could be very helpful for you now. They can help you get the education you need in a way you feel good about.","Your attention to detail could be useful now for improving an arrangement where you share money or property with others. It might be important for you to look at the actual laws or rules related to what you're trying to do. You may discover that authority figures are less harsh about certain details than you had assumed. However, don't go to the other extreme of scheming to game a vague system. Make a point to stay balanced as you take care of business.","Connecting with someone close could be exciting for you at this time, but you may have to be careful not to lose sight of your own limits in the relationship. It might be easy to get so caught up in the moment that boundaries don't seem important, but getting things off on the wrong track now could lead to problems later. Your idea of what a good relationship should look like is important -- just try to be aware if it needs to be updated.","Adjusting your routines at home can be empowering for you today. However, you might need to accept that you can only control your own routines, as others you live with likely have their own ideas about how they want to do things. No matter how much room there is for everyone's preferences, you can't just optimistically assume that everything will work out on its own. Looking at your situation with care and intention may be necessary to make sure that everyone's boundaries are respected.","A big talk in one of your close relationships could go well for you at the moment. You have a healthy sense of your own needs, but you can express them in a way that honors the other person's freedom too. It may, however, be harder for you to maintain a realistic sense of your regular daily capability. Be careful about taking on new responsibilities that look cool at first glance, as they may wind up being more work than you expect.","Ways you can use your money or possessions to make things better for your family may seem crystal clear at this time. If you don't also consider your own desires, though, they might pop out of seemingly nowhere and sabotage even your best-laid plans. It may be time for you to thoughtfully check in with your sense of what you are and are not responsible for. This can help you make decisions that honor your own needs as well as benefit others with theirs.","Oversharing in conversation may be all too easy for you today. You might be in touch with your thoughts about your upbringing and your personal wounds, and they could come out as you chat with others. Try to be aware of whether or not your audience seems comfortable, as not everyone is necessarily up for those discussions. If you do find someone who's genuinely interested in pursuing these issues with you, your greatest challenge might be pushing yourself to listen as well as you talk.","You may know how much money you really have, but bluffing to others that you have more might sound rather alluring for you now. As long as you don't start believing your own exaggerations, you could run into an odd situation where this is actually a helpful approach. Insecurity about finances stemming from your upbringing could positively motivate you to get creative about doing whatever you must to get ahead. You can take pride in your ingenuity, as long as you know when to stop.","Hearing about a friend in need could motivate you to help in any way you can today. That said, try to make sure your feelings of generosity are coming from a healthy place. Your friends probably love you for who you are more than you realize, so there's no need for you to buy their affection. Whatever assistance you give, do it in a way that has an obvious path to return to a balanced relationship after the crisis has passed.","You may be recognized for an achievement of yours at this time, but there might be more to the story than the world hears. Even if you aren't entirely comfortable with this way of handling it, try to defer to the judgment of those in authority. They may have to consider other factors that aren't on your radar. Respecting their sensitivities can help you advance further with them, but remember that you might not be able to rely on them for all of your needs."
2022-01-28,"Knowing the truth immediately might feel vitally important today. As inquisitive Mercury meets penetrating Pluto at 11:16 pm EST, we may feel like there are no limits on what qualifies as our business. Pushing back against that, the sensitive Moon squares ungrounded Neptune, so fact-finding missions that get too aggressive could be met with hurt feelings or simply noncommittal responses. However, Luna also interacts harmoniously with practical Saturn. If we can accept reasonable boundaries, we may get at least some of our questions answered.","A boss or other authority figure might seem to be picking at you for petty things today, and you could feel down on yourself if you see it as important to please this person. It may be necessary to consider whether the complaints are about keeping you in your place rather than about whatever you allegedly did wrong. Your friends or a favorite advice blog may be able to give you a helpful outside perspective on how legitimate this person's grievances are.","Figuring out where you stand on a controversial issue could seem urgent to you today. You may see the point in keeping up with changing times, but it might not be clear what the people affected actually want from you -- they might not even agree with each other. Consider looking into the words of a relevant authority figure to cut through any confusion. Even if they aren't necessarily the final word on the subject, they can at least give you a place to start.","Unrealistic expectations could be blocking your view of the smoothest path toward achieving a working arrangement for sharing money or property. You may secretly want the other person to take care of you -- or you might want to be seen as the powerful provider who takes care of them. Though you may not need to discuss such private feelings with the other person, admitting them at least to yourself can help you think more clearly about what would work best in the real world.","You may believe that acts of service will get you what you want in one of your close relationships now. However, you could wind up feeling burned out and resentful if the other person doesn't pick up on your hints in the way you expect. You might be better off initiating a direct conversation with them, even if the idea intimidates you. They may turn out to be willing to share some responsibilities with you once they become aware of the need.","A clear vision of a diet or schedule that could solve your problems may come to you now, but you might also see its potential to disrupt the comfortable coexistence you currently have with others. As long as you warn the people you're concerned about in advance, they could take the upheaval better than you expect. Instead of worrying about their reactions, try to acknowledge your own fears about trying something new. It's OK to be both excited and scared at the same time!","Your inner child could have something useful to say today, but you might have to make an effort to hear it. While you don't have to abandon your responsibilities, you may need to approach them in a way that's more fair to your own limits. Someone else might be holding you to standards that just aren't realistic for anyone -- including you! If your instinctive reaction is that they've crossed a line, trust that instinct. Sometimes the truth isn't any more complicated than that.","You may feel intensely devoted to your work at this time. That said, if you try to talk about it with others, hearing out loud how much you have embraced an attitude of martyrdom could shock you. You might need to think about whether the attitudes toward responsibility you learned while you were growing up are still working for you. Taking care of yourself is just as important as any other responsibilities you may have, and embracing that can help you find a healthy balance.","A potential financial opportunity may be hard to see clearly right now. Remembering your more serious obligations, like rent or family expenses, might help you determine how much you can risk on something uncertain. You could also benefit from taking a good look at your motivations before you move forward, because even an idea that has some realistic potential might not succeed if you approach it in an emotionally unbalanced way. An intense conversation or journaling session may lead to some surprisingly helpful insights.","Getting to the root of a money problem could be important for you at this time. However, acknowledging your own contributions to the issue might be difficult, especially if complicated family dynamics are involved. Insight on your past is great if you can achieve it, but even if you can't make that happen right now, you should still benefit from practical guidance on what to do going forward. Talking to someone else who isn't involved can get you a more objective perspective if necessary.","Some things may be best kept to yourself for now. While you might have to reveal just enough to keep the practical side of your life humming along smoothly, you can probably do this without getting into whatever details you think are too controversial or private to share. Vague communication could help you hide the rest. Be careful not to focus so much on keeping one secret that you let another one slip out! Remember that there is only so much you can hold inside.","You can be a genius today! Your peers may perceive you as a stable and rational presence amidst a potentially chaotic situation and believe that you make complex things look easy. However, they might not be aware of everything going on inside your head that you don't share. Hiding some practical details from other people to keep them calm may make sense, but don't let your bravado hide important facts from you! You have the potential to do good, but know your limits.","Feeling pressured by friends who want to know your views on an important topic could just make you less inclined to give them an answer. Although you might be certain of your own beliefs, you could suspect that they aren't what others want to hear. Your sense that you have to hide important things about yourself may ultimately be a bigger issue than whatever the conflict of the moment is about. For now, hiding behind ambiguity can give you space to plan your next moves."
2022-01-29,"Our connections could start off running smoothly today, but we can't take harmony for granted. Social Venus turns direct at 3:46 am EST, easing some frustrations in our relationships. However, the security-seeking Moon joins with Venus and assertive Mars, all in the efficient sign of Capricorn. We may be able to successfully pursue what we want, but slowing down enough to acknowledge the emotions of others could be more challenging. Remember that kindness will ultimately be less of a speed bump than a fight.","Clarity on a money matter that has been holding you back in your career lately could finally be coming. As you sort out the last few details, you may need to acknowledge that getting the professional progress you crave will likely require you to move past the comfort zone of your current knowledge. Being anxious about this is understandable, but try to avoid taking your fears out on others as you negotiate. There are probably things they can't make as definitive as you would like.","You may be excited to learn about another culture at the moment, but you could discover that you like the idea of leaving your comfort zone more than the actual experience of it. You don't have to be ashamed of whatever your honest feelings are, but you may need to decide what to do next. If continuing to engage in this situation is really important to you, you might want to proceed at a slower pace that is realistic about your limitations.","An investment you may have been watching for a while could seem to take off today. While adding more money to the same pot in hopes of getting an even bigger return is likely tempting, try to keep your big picture in mind. You might need to balance the uncertain prospect of increasing your income against your known obligations like paying off debt. Taking some action toward both ends could be appropriate, but only gamble with money you can afford to lose.","Starting a new partnership, or deepening an existing connection, could be exciting for you now. Though it may be tremendously validating to feel like someone really understands you, watch out for potentially moving -- or trying to move -- too fast. You might not be aware of the other person's sore spots yet, and asking them too many questions at once in an effort to get to know them could potentially hit one. Give them space to share in their own way instead.","Beautifying your surroundings could be incredibly compelling for you today. You may, however, need to make an effort to know when to stop. Even if you can envision exactly what you'd do with a clearer space, you might not be emotionally ready to get rid of the excess possessions that currently fill it. You probably have more time than you think to carry out any plan in your mind, so slow down to honor the feelings that may come up for you.","Pursuing your own pleasure may seem urgent right now. While you might think it's out of character for you to be this self-focused, maybe the bigger change is actually your awareness of your desires. Fortunately, your potential fear that doing what you want will somehow hurt others doesn't have to be reality. When you acknowledge that your needs for fun are real and have a right to exist, you can rationally plan to meet them in a way that doesn't trample others.","Building your desired home life may be possible at this time, but the process might not always be comfortable. Trying to make even small or necessary changes could trigger conflict, as the other people involved might feel threatened. They may fear that what you are proposing will take away their current security and leave them without anything to replace it. If you have solid reasons to believe that you can offer them a better future, do your best to communicate that to avoid any issues.","Misunderstandings may be easy to come by at the moment, as you might be in such a hurry to get things done that you don't think through the way your words sound to others. Hearing from someone you have offended could be the wake-up call you need to correct your course! You probably have more time to fix things than you think you do. Slowing down enough to nurture your relationships might even get you some outside help with any tasks you're worried about.","Paying attention to your finances is especially important right now, but the first idea that pops into your head might not be the best one. Your longing for security may actually tempt you to do something impulsive. If you can be a little more patient, thinking about what's really important to you can help you come up with a strategy to secure stable funding for your top priorities. It may be as simple as dropping some recurring charges that are no longer relevant.","Impatience with others who don't agree with you could strike you today, but you might need to be realistic about the limits of your control. While the domestic Moon, graceful Venus, and strong Mars are all in your sign to teach you what's best for you personally, no planet can give you the right to make certain decisions for others. You might have to settle for leading by example. Fortunately, with Venus moving direct in your sign, your example could look even better than usual!","Letting a new connection develop outside of the public's view could make sense to you now. Whether it's a business or personal relationship, you might want to get to know each other before you let the world know you are an item. However, the greatest threat to your privacy could be your own tendency to talk about each other. A boisterous partnership is not a problem as long as it works for both parties, but you need to be aware of its limitations.","Drama could erupt in your friend group or a community you belong to at this time. Before you try to decide which side to take, look at whether or not the people involved feel connected to each other in any positive ways. Conflict may appeal to people if the only alternative appears to be an absence of emotion. Instead of getting lost in any current uproar, you might be able to work toward peace by helping people find more fulfilling ways to engage."
2022-01-30,"We may be torn between openness and secrecy today. The bright Sun squares shocking Uranus at 2:32 pm EST, so we might feel like it's the right time to make a dramatic announcement. However, as the protective Moon in Capricorn meets thoughtful Mercury and withholding Pluto in the same sign, it may seem important to keep some things to ourselves. It's fine for a story to have limits, but the most important limit might be telling only the stories that are truly ours to tell.","A risky financial move could be going well enough for you that you're tempted to brag about it to someone. However, you may not want people you're connected with through a more conservative setting, like your job, to know about this side of you. Anonymous boasting on social media might work, but that can be less secret than you think! You may be better off sharing a limited version of things with whoever you're worried about, so they at least hear it from you first.","You may find yourself shaking things up in your career at the moment -- whether you want to or not! That said, the ruckus might at least concern something you've been thinking deeply about for a long time. While people may not be ready to process the details today if their initial shock is too great, your knowledge that there is more to the story can help you maintain your own calm. Try to remember that it was once new to you too.","Sharing your view of the world may be tempting now, but finding the right boundaries could challenge you. Your opinions on contentious subjects might have been formed by very personal experiences that you didn't necessarily have alone. Telling these stories in a way that protects the privacy of other people who were involved may be difficult for you. It might be necessary to let go of the idea that you can make everyone happy, but don't let go of your sense of decency.","You may want to update how your social network sees you now, but the thought of very publicly revealing new parts of yourself could be intimidating for good reason. Perhaps the situation calls for a more casual approach. Slipping your news into whatever conversations you would ordinarily have might be all you need to do! Others may not find it as controversial as you expect, but your attitude could also make a difference. Almost anything can become less dramatic when presented in a low-key way.","Having a strong grasp of the day-to-day details of your work could support a big idea you have about the overall direction of your career. However, someone important to you might not be on the same page. You may have to decide if upsetting this person in the moment is a price you are willing to pay in order to move forward. That said, without taking the risk, you'll never get to see if they might come around to support your position later.","Getting work done may come easily today, as you can be in tune with your own unique strategies -- ones that are potentially a better fit for you than the methods that authority figures recommend. If anyone hassles you about not following the rules, or if you have your own concerns about it, try looking at your results. While you should change any tactics that aren't effective, it's currently more likely that the rules should shift toward your approach rather than the other way around.","Family secrets could be on your mind at this time, but you may need to consider how necessary keeping them private is at this point. Since you got into the habit of silence, a significant person might no longer be in the picture, or times could have changed so that an issue involved is no longer considered shameful. Speaking your truth may be liberating for you now if you're ready, but be aware that beginning to process it openly could awaken new challenges for you.","You may want to portray a particular image of your family, but you might not be able to control how someone else tells their side of the story. If you're put off by a perspective that is different from yours being shared, you may need to be honest -- at least with yourself -- about what you could be editing out of your narrative. The honesty of others might feel less threatening when you expand your own truth to acknowledge the full complexity of reality.","Worries about money could be weighing on you now, but don't let anxiety distract you from potential solutions. If you remain attentive in any conversations that come up for you today, you may hear of an opportunity to earn additional income. Though it might not be what you expected for yourself, you aren't likely to solve your problems by ruminating over the existing facts. Trying something new, even if you don't stick with it for long, can help you get out of your rut.","A financial risk you're considering at the moment could turn out well for you, but you might need to be aware of what's motivating you to pursue it. You may feel like money would help you impress others who aren't taking you seriously. Even if such a strategy succeeded, the feeling that you can only meet your needs through manipulation could make it a hollow victory. Go for the gold, but also look for people who accept you just the way you are!","You may now be doing something very differently from how your family handled similar situations when you were growing up. However, there might be more subtle ways that you're still influenced by your upbringing. Acknowledging this fact can help you intentionally take advantage of your sign's unique gift for blending the best of old and new influences. Whether or not you're already well aware of why change is sometimes necessary, keeping past techniques that work can help you build lasting innovations.","Adjusting some boundaries might be necessary today. Hiding some of your private life from your larger social network can make sense at times, but you may need to remember what you're hiding and why. If you aren't careful with some of your friendships, a secret could be about to come out. If it doesn't really need to be a secret, though, maybe it's simply a piece of information about you that the other person didn't know yet. Sharing things about yourself can help build trust."
2022-01-31,"Our rational side may be powerful today, though it could also be obvious that there's more to us than that. After the Moon enters thoughtful Aquarius at 4:43 am EST, she sextiles sensitive Chiron, helping us get objective insights on any of our pressing emotional matters. When Luna squares active Uranus, though, just doing something different immediately may seem more important than carefully considering our options. Even if we're not sure about it in the moment, we can learn from our experience later.","Your friends may see you more kindly than you see yourself at this time. Although you might be focused on your flaws, they can see things in you that you've forgotten about. Let them remind you of this, even if they don't say so out loud! Just the way they interact with you can show that you have value. Keeping this perspective in mind may help you make more thoughtful decisions, as you can impress others without taking crazy risks.","An authority figure, like a boss or older relative, could be using the threat of their emotions to keep you in line. You may fear that expressing yourself in the way that feels most natural or important to you will push them into a breakdown. Understanding that someone else probably manipulated them in the same way they are now manipulating you could help you have empathy for them. As you may have discovered, having the courage to break the cycle is harder than it sounds.","You may be able to comfort a friend going through a rough patch by taking a philosophical perspective at this time. Though that approach can't soothe every type of suffering, a situation where it does work reasonably well might give you a glimpse of its limitations. One unusual experience can sometimes do more for your understanding of the world than years of intellectual labor. Your thoughts might be on to something, but they could still need work to equal all your experiences.","A heavy issue might be on your mind now, but the thought of airing it with friends could be unappealing. They may not understand all the nuances of a complicated situation. You may be better off talking to an authority figure who's more directly connected to your dilemma. Though past experiences with people in charge might have been disappointing for you, trying again and getting a better result could help you heal old wounds as well as make progress on your current problem.","You may know what you need to do to make progress on your major life goals, but the feelings of security you get from keeping your relationships just the way they are at the moment could get in the way. Talking directly with the people you're concerned about might be more helpful than you expect -- even if it's also rather intimidating. If they're truly in favor of you doing whatever you're afraid to do, you can't hide behind them as an excuse any longer.","Taking action to address a situation where responsibilities aren't being shared fairly could go surprisingly well for you at this time. However, your victory celebration could be marred by regret over all the times in the past you didn't speak up and just let unfairness go unchallenged. Knowing what is possible right now can help you reshape your views of what you're actually responsible for. Abandoning one assumption you long took for granted could set off a domino effect of questioning others as well.","You may need to ask yourself how you would share resources differently if you knew a particular relationship was a safe place where your kind nature wouldn't get exploited. Though having your own space and possessions can certainly be important, collaborating with others in some ways could free up money for you to spend on different things. A good conversation in a relevant relationship may help you uncover some options. The freer you feel to reject an offer, the better it probably is.","Any efforts to find peace and quiet at home could be blocked by someone else's current turmoil. While you may be frustrated that you can't entirely solve the other person's problem, you might still be able to help them in some practical ways. This could relieve your feelings of powerlessness over the immediate crisis, and also leave you wondering what your obligations to others are going forward. There may not be an easy answer, but asking the question could be good for you.","Errands could have some fun surprises for you today. If you've been feeling bored with your routine lately, getting out and seeing even a little bit of the world may help you escape your rut. The goofy quirks of ordinary people who aren't you can be wonderfully refreshing. This kind of small pleasure might give you a tidbit to bring up in conversation with others later, which could cheer you up even further. You need people -- especially those you take for granted.","Thinking about the struggles of your early years could motivate you to focus on financial safety today. However, it may be hard for you to appreciate the extent to which your life has changed since then. While you don't want to take a chance with your funds for the wrong reasons, avoiding risk for the wrong reasons might not be much better. Making lists of your specific assets and obligations could help you get an accurate view of your current situation.","Achieving security could be hard for you right now. You might hate to admit that you even want that stability, but it's OK to be looking for that in your environment. Even you are human, after all, and that part of your life may need attention. A good conversation with someone that you trust can help you find a path to balance the competing needs of your visionary intellect and your primal body. Your solution will probably be just as unique as you are!","Saying something shocking to get attention may greatly tempt you now. Keep in mind that acting in a way that's out of line with your values could just leave you feeling more alone than you did before, as even you might not be comfortable with yourself at that point. If you don't see a good way to get the connection you need from others at the moment, you might want to figure out how to make your own company more exciting and fulfilling."
2022-02-01,"Realism and inspiration can blend to bring about wonderful change today. An intriguing New Moon in Aquarius is hugging sensible Saturn closely for extra support by 6:01 am EST. All New Moons prod us to make a change, and none more so than an Aquarian New Moon, which demands plenty of consideration for those around us. Collaboration is the key! Taking small steps as a group can have long-lasting benefits and take us all closer to where we want to be.","Inspiration could strike at any moment! In fact, you might feel ready to change the world all on your own -- but you might want to remember that you can achieve far more in a group than you could alone. Even the smallest activities will be easier with some helping hands. Don't hesitate to expand your network with new members or to reach out and call someone you may have lost track of. After all, someone has to make the first move.","Breaking free from whatever may be holding you back might feel easier than ever today! You'll likely need to speak up and be clear about what you want -- happily, there's no need to follow this path alone. Don't hesitate to share your goals with others and, by extension, make connections that will help you build the future you really want. They could show you how to clarify your goals and take the first step toward turning your dreams into reality.","The last thing you probably want today is to feel bored. Waiting for an adventure to drop into your lap could take a long time -- it might be a better idea to pull some ideas from the back of your mind and follow up on them. They may not be something you would normally do, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth trying. Whether or not the end result is what you planned on, you could make some wonderful memories in the process.","Your relationship with the resources of others may feel out of balance right now. In particular, if you feel like someone is taking advantage of you, it's time to do something about it. Whenever you find yourself only giving and never getting anything back in return, remember that you'll eventually run out of things to give -- metaphorically or literally. You can start a conversation about this by talking about smaller things and building up to any bigger issues on the table.","You may be able to find fresh clarity with others today. While it's normal to need someone to rely on, you can't expect people to guess how you feel. If you need more support in general or someone specific to be more available, that's more likely to happen if you tell them. All relationships -- familial, platonic, and otherwise -- are two-way streets, so you might need to ask yourself how companionable you're being in return. Treat others how you'd like to be treated!","Being a little too hard on yourself for not meeting your own standards will be all too easy today. No matter how fit or healthy you are, you may get stuck in a spiral of worrying that you could do better. You can banish these concerns by taking a close look at what you've actually been doing lately. If you've been procrastinating, now is a good time to make a change. If you're doing well, give yourself a pat on the back!","Life is more enjoyable when you know your efforts have been appreciated! You might currently be in charge of doing whatever's necessary for you and your friends to go out and have a good time. That might sound boring, but it doesn't have to be. As long as you take into account everyone's feedback and don't just go your own way regardless of what anyone else thinks, you'll likely be able to take the credit for some truly delightful adventures with enthusiastic friends.","Insecurity can creep in all too easily if you aren't getting the support you need. No matter how capable you are at this time, it's OK to reach out and ask for help! Speaking up about it shouldn't cause drama as long as you respect the needs of others as well. Just keep in mind that it isn't personal if the answer is no. People have their own hassles to deal with, and you might need to make your plans around those.","A genius idea may burst into your mind at any moment -- but it'll stay just an idea unless you work at it. Let today's busy energy inspire you to come up with some realistic ways of getting things done. The process might become even easier if you take a moment to write down your process and tick things off your list once they've been completed. That said, don't waste time. Ideas that arrive quickly could vanish just as easily if you aren't careful!","Some pertinent details in your financial goals could catch your gaze at this time. You might even want to rework your budget to achieve them more efficiently! That doesn't necessarily mean that you want to turn everything upside down and find a new way to make money. As long as you make sure that you're clear about the nitty-gritty pieces of your plans, you should be able to make -- and keep -- some sensible plans for both your current and future finances.","There's nothing wrong with letting people know when you feel let down. Fortunately, it shouldn't take that much effort to turn things around -- just stay focused on putting your best foot forward. Even if things don't turn out quite as you'd hoped they would, those around you should notice your effort and appreciate that you tried! Everyone's self-confidence gets dented from time to time, but sometimes you just have to push through it and believe everything will turn out fine. You've got this!","When there's a lot going on, it can be hard to stick to your plans -- or even to work out precisely what those plans are! Some time out to recharge your batteries might be necessary. Spending a few hours of the day enjoying your own company could allow any confusing thoughts that are spinning around your head to start making sense. People may be more likely than you'd think to understand if you need to step back for a little while."
2022-02-02,"A dreamy haze could conceal much of today from our logical minds. Thanks to the emotional Moon slipping into Pisces this morning, we may forget more than a few details of our plans. That shifts when the Moon sextiles go-getter Mars at 5:33 pm EST and conjuncts optimistic Jupiter later. We could feel uplifted and able to get things done -- even if we get a little carried away or can't finish it all, this boost of enthusiasm might make all the difference.","You may be so good at relaxing today, you could take it up as a career. Getting some peace and quiet will likely be your goal, thanks to the gentle Moon conjuncting generous Jupiter. Everyone needs to step back and smell the flowers once in a while -- even you! If you aren't careful, you could end up in an argument later in the day, but it's unlikely to be too serious. An intense debate would take more energy than you want to expend.","The people around you can bring out the best in you right now. Socializing with peers or loved ones should help you feel like a part of things, especially if you can connect with those who see the world in the same way as you do. What others think about you may matter more than usual -- don't let anyone bring you down, but it's OK to try and work with other people's opinions. Hearing some different philosophies could inspire you to expand your own.","Your intuition could be boosted into the stratosphere at this time, making it much easier than usual to work out what people really mean. As the sensitive Moon sextiles intense Mars, allow yourself to focus on really listening to the people around you. When they feel appreciated and heard by you, they may be more inclined to listen in return and realize what matters to you as well. Let positivity guide your interactions with others -- it won't steer you wrong.","There's no need to take life too seriously right now! The current lightness in the air may inspire you to bring up a potentially controversial topic. Let the universe help you express yourself in a way that's clear, firm, and honest, while still being kind enough to avoid causing any offense. You never know -- a friend may have agreed with you all along but simply didn't know how to bring the subject up. Even if they disagree, you could have a fun debate.","Clashing with the people around you is possible today, but it can be avoided. As the thoughtful Moon sextiles protective Mars, you can focus on the needs of others to avoid potential issues or misunderstandings. You might also be prone to reading too much into a situation, so try to minimize any particularly dramatic feelings. Sometimes situations really are as they appear to be! Staying on the sidelines until your mind can get on more stable ground would be a good idea.","Honest communication is rarely easy, and today it might be more difficult than usual to walk the tightrope of sharing versus listening. Expressing your feelings is great, as long as you're not talking over whoever's on the receiving end. You and any conversation partners both need to listen to each other's points of view. It might not be necessary to share every last detail about yourself to them, or vice versa -- a little bit of sharing can go a long way!","Getting things done properly can soothe your worries today. Even if others aren't prepared to deal with any tasks that pop up, you probably won't want to stop until everything is completed! You may not be known as the most organized sign, Libra, but right now you may have a good sense for where your efforts are most needed versus where any attempts to help might incite some chaos to rise from beneath the surface. Try to avoid biting off more than you can chew.","Indulging in something that makes you feel good is probably a tempting way to spend your day. This doesn't need to be a big deal or a long vacation -- you just need something to help you throw off any stress you've felt lately. Of course, you probably need to get some daily responsibilities out of the way first. It may take some effort to finish them, but you can stay motivated by reminding yourself of the potential rewards to come.","Most of the day is likely to be peaceful, but you may still need to be a little on guard. While it can be nice to spend lots of time with your loved ones, everyone needs space sometimes. If tempers start to flare later today, ask yourself if you're being a teensy bit unreasonable. You could also make an effort to be upfront about why you want whatever you're asking for. When people understand where you're coming from, they're far less likely to get annoyed.","Your emotions could feel more intense than usual today -- which can be both good and bad. Being in touch with your feelings is healthy, but remember that not everyone will be interested in hearing about them. There's no harm in explaining yourself when necessary, as long as you listen to others as well. You could also go too far in the other direction and act nosy when it comes to someone else's business. Just do your best to stay balanced between the two extremes.","Financial honesty will serve you well today. If you're genuinely low on necessary cash, a loved one or lending agency may be able to help you out. On the other hand, if you just feel like you need more money because you can't quite afford something that's taken your fancy, you might want to wait until you have more solid resources. This is a great time to cut away any monetary waste so you can afford a real treat at a later date.","You've got cosmic permission to feel good and take it easy! The soft Moon enters your sign today, so while you may feel a bit over-sensitive, that doesn't have to be a major problem. If you take your time and make sure that you're able to relax when you need to, you can avoid getting overwhelmed. Spending some time alone could help rejuvenate you -- feel free to put off what you can until tomorrow and enjoy some quiet contemplation in your inner world."
2022-02-03,"We can all breathe a sigh of relief today! Speedy Mercury turns direct at 11:13 pm EST, and we should start feeling the effects even earlier than that. Any leftover frustrations should, at last, be able to find resolution. However, the moody Moon does conjunct elusive Neptune this evening, so it might remain hard to get a completely clear picture of what's going on. Still, there's nothing wrong with a few daydreams -- after all, that's often how new plans are born.","A little bit of clarity can go a very long way! Cerebral Mercury has finally turned direct, so when people have misconceptions about you, correcting them is a good idea. It may be a bit of a bore, but it will bring you benefits in the long run. In fact, the connections you build at this time may make all the difference in the future. True friendships aren't built in a day, but you can begin them with a solid foundation right now.","The big picture might seem too big for you to make sense of it at the moment. Don't worry too much about any false starts or missteps you may have made lately -- no one can be perfect all of the time. Once rational Mercury turns direct, you should finally be able to correct any recent errors and get back on the right path -- or an even better path! You could have a greater impact than you think, so it's making an effort.","Getting a favor from someone or borrowing something may be a lot less complicated today. That said, you might not even need to do so at all! Make an effort to take a close look at your own resources and see how far they will stretch. It's alright if you do need a helping hand, but it's best not to rush into anything. Avoid confusion and future snags by allowing yourself time to consider the pros and cons of any potential agreements.","Personal differences may make it difficult to get things done today. No matter how it seems, you might have more in common with your opposition than you think. Maybe you won't be the best of friends, but there's probably no reason to be mortal enemies either. Working together to resolve your differences -- or at least to agree to disagree -- could be to your mutual benefit. Try your best to keep your eye on the ball rather than worrying about who's throwing it.","Delays, mishaps, and scheduling conflicts may seem to be the story of your life today! At least, it might feel like that until busy Mercury finally turns direct in your routine sector. Although it might feel like you've done little except run in circles, chances are you've actually been pretty productive. Do your best to reach out if you have concerns about anything -- ironing out potential misunderstandings will be worth it later. Any lingering sense of uncertainty should fade once your questions are answered.","This is a great day to get things done -- especially if you've felt unable to get started on any creative projects lately. As shrewd Mercury turns direct and gets to work in your 5th House of Inspiration, you too can push the world's distractions aside and make firm plans to start any projects that you've been saying you would do tomorrow or just as soon as you finished some other task. Sometimes you have to stop preparing and just go for it!","Your past could be weighing you down right now, dragging you into a rut that seems to be getting deeper all the time. Do your best to tell yourself that any recent delays and detours to your plans were only a temporary glitch. Sometimes you just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other to make it through the day. Before you know it, things might not only be back to normal, they may be even better than before!","It may seem like people have been deliberately trying to baffle you lately. Even if they aren't, it's likely been all too easy to grab the wrong end of the stick. Luckily, now that logical Mercury has turned direct, you can get back on track with a greater sense of purpose. Plus, it wasn't all a waste of time. Although some confusion might have felt silly, it also could have highlighted some formerly hidden issues that need to be sorted out.","Your life may be tangled up with several loose ends at the moment, but you've finally got the power to pick them all up and get things in their proper place. Any setbacks or self-esteem issues could seem to melt away as focused Mercury turns direct in your personal worth sector. Even if you've had to take things slow lately, that just means you've been taking the time to do them right. Now you can get out there and make your move!","You can truly kick your life into gear today. Thanks to discerning Mercury moving direct in your sign, your attitude matters! At times like this, how you feel about the way you look matters just as much as your actual appearance. What feels good probably is good. You might want to test a few changes -- even if they don't stick, it's a good idea to at least try them out. You might discover a part of yourself that really likes something new.","Procrastination might actually be your best option at the moment. While things on the surface are likely to become clearer when brilliant Mercury turns direct in your 12th House of Contemplation today, some chaos may be bubbling deep down. That added information can make all the difference, and you never know when it will rise to the surface. Instead of tying yourself down to any specific decision or cause, take this time to start gathering any relevant information you can.","Working out who your real friends are may not be easy today. Whether you expect too much from the wrong person or ignore someone who wanted to be there for you, things might be pretty muddled until smart Mercury finally turns direct in your 11th House of Community. By the end of the day, things should become much clearer -- you could realize that you've already got plenty of reliable pals. Don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help from a true friend!"
2022-02-04,"Today is meant for getting things done! Sometimes impulsive actions are just what we need to get going. Following our whims is encouraged when go-getter Mars sextiles optimistic Jupiter at 8:38 am EST. We may be itching to get on with things by the time the changeable Moon moves into action-packed Aries. While that combination could make us cast caution to the winds, the Sun conjoins sensible Saturn and makes it easier to consider our decisions before we commit to them.","Something needs to be done at this time -- the question is what? A mild feeling of discontent might make you feel that whatever it is, you need to get moving. Being clear about your feelings on any pertinent issues isn't a bad thing unless you stomp over the feelings of those closest to you. Fortunately, as the day continues, you can realize that people around you aren't trying to put a damper on your day -- they're actually attempting to offer some sensible advice.","You might be kept on your toes by lots of things happening today. Chances are high that you're craving some peace and quiet so you can mull things over before you work out which way you want to turn. Your opinion might be swayed if you gain recognition for a recent achievement -- perhaps the path you want to follow right now relates to that. Still, there's no mad rush! Taking the time to contemplate your options today can avoid problems tomorrow.","Success is almost within your grasp today! However, regardless of any obstacles in your way, it'll probably be worth it for you to do things your way. That doesn't mean you want to act alone, of course, but in the end, you do make your own decisions. An extra dose of skepticism later in the day could help ensure that you don't get led off course. Understanding the difference between procrastination and waiting until the best moment should take you in the right direction.","Getting what you want will be much easier at this time when it's in line with what other people want. Even if they don't offer actual support, at least they won't get in your way. If their potential opinions bother you, it would be wise to ask them directly. Think of it this way -- no matter what they say, you'll have a clear answer to work with rather than anxious speculation about what they might think. You just need to start the conversation!","You might be a little over-optimistic about your capabilities at the moment! Even though you're like to get the favors you want right now, you will have to pay them back in the future. Take a moment and make sure that whatever you want is worth it! If you don't rush into things, getting people to cooperate might be easier, and it could also stop you from asking for things that both of you might regret later. Do your best to be reasonable.","Resentment may churn in your heart if someone else takes the initiative and tries to pull you along with them without asking what you wanted to do. It's good to stand up for yourself, but keep in mind that it isn't just about you. There's no need to be dramatic if you disagree -- simply state your case calmly. Getting things into order before making a move might particularly appeal to you, Virgo, so everything should turn out just fine in the end!.","A lot of voices could be shouting different opinions at the moment. Other people's plans or ideas can be a pain when they mess up your own, but sometimes you simply have to keep moving through the chaos. Your words could be overlooked in all the fuss, so try to keep any snarky commentary to yourself and remember that this is only temporary. Thinking things through before opening your mouth isn't exciting, but it can stop you from creating even more of an unnecessary ruckus.","Taking a risk could pay off in a big way today! Nothing is guaranteed, but things are more likely to go your way. It helps that right now you can notice all the little details that sometimes pass you by. Once you're aware of the details, it'll be easier to make everything work smoothly. You should be able to fulfill your responsibilities without too much trouble -- you might even discover some items on your to-do list that can wait until tomorrow.","Paying some extra attention to your home life at the moment can nip problems in the bud before they become a real hassle. There may be some fun and games on offer later, and you'll be able to dive in and enjoy yourself more once you've removed any potential stress. In order to solve current debates and avoid future ones, consider paying close attention to how you talk to people and making sure that there's no room for any misunderstandings.","Today is likely to be really hectic. As soon as you've paid attention to one thing, three more pop up, which you can blame on energetic Mars in your sign forming a sextile with extravagant Jupiter in your multi-tasking sector. Staying as grounded as possible is the best approach -- even if that's easier said than done! One thing you could focus on is getting your finances in order. A close look could reveal that things are a lot more positive than you'd thought.","Wanting to make some waves right now is understandable, but you might want to make sure it's only a splash and not a tsunami -- especially when it comes to your finances. It may be all too easy to let money trickle through your fingers! You're capable of being sensible when you need to be, but you might have to give yourself a few stern reminders. Try to remember that keeping yourself busy doesn't have to include constantly spending money on new and expensive experiences.","Whatever you decide to do today, you can be more confident than usual about asking for what you need and making sure you get it. On the other hand, if what you need is outside of your comfort zone, you might prefer to stay tightly snuggled in it instead. That isn't necessarily a problem -- unless you use it as an excuse to procrastinate and avoid dealing with any urgent unfinished business. Things won't go away just because you're ignoring them!"
2022-02-05,"Motivation might be in short supply today. The sensitive Moon makes a stressful square to Venus at 7:56 am EST, making the idea of staying cozied up in bed more attractive than it's ever been. The best option might be to promise we'll give ourselves a treat for later, so we can have something to look forward to. Things could get busier as the day goes on, and we'll probably be very pleased that we've planned some time to take a fun break.","Someone might grate on your nerves by demanding one thing after another from you. While they may be entitled to ask things of you, you're allowed to ignore them and pay attention to your own life instead. You may have to simply shrug your shoulders and get on with things. On the other hand, spending a bit of your time with old and comfortable friends can add some cheer to your day without weighing you down underneath any unnecessary burdens.","Dealing with people who don't see the world in the same way as you can be tiring -- right now, it might be downright stressful. Happily, all you need to do today is be prepared to ask if there's something going on that you don't understand. People might not realize you need any help unless you ask, so saying something the moment you feel lost is a good idea. A small amount of effort now could save you a lot of grief later!","A little bit of self-indulgence shouldn't do you any harm right now. In fact, it may help you feel better able to face the world. The key thing is to keep it only to a little bit! Getting carried away could make it difficult to get anything else done. If you need help motivating yourself, think about why you want to do the things that you're doing. It may take a while to find the answers, but the questions are worth asking.","You may be too concerned about manipulation from friends at the moment. It's possible that you're blaming others for cramping your style when you've done all the cramping yourself! Consider taking a close look at the ties that bind you to see if there are better approaches. You may be worried that if you let someone take an inch, they'll take a mile. In reality, it's more likely that your loved ones or peers will offer you some of their inches in return.","Currently, people could seem to lack respect for your boundaries. It may feel like they're calling in favors solely to be a nuisance! That said, you might need to consider the idea that their requests are reasonable -- you're just tired. Even if doing anything feels exhausting, you should make an effort to ensure you at least cover what you promised. A commitment's a commitment! Once you've dealt with any necessary tasks, you can get back to relaxing and recharging.","Having fun might seem to involve far too much hard work, right now! It's OK to hit pause on a hobby if you aren't enjoying yourself. Plus, you can take this time to get some work done on other things. When it comes to your daily tasks, there is probably plenty of help available as long as you politely tell people when you need it. Today is a day for being practical -- and making space for the fun that will come again later.","Domestic obligations can be tiresome today, perhaps even completely cramping your style. In fact, you might start to wonder if you have a style at all! There's no point in moping about and moaning. Maybe there isn't as much fun and excitement on offer as you'd like, but that doesn't mean you need to completely write off today. It's OK not to be happy all the time -- feel free to show your true feelings as you get things done in whatever way you can.","You could be distracted by countless people requesting favors from you right now. Fortunately, you don't have to say yes just because someone asks. You don't have to say no to everything either, but it's fair to pick and choose. Your best option is to do your best to work out whether you have enough free time and enthusiasm for the task. If not, you might be able to pass it on to someone close to you who could actually help.","A bit of retail therapy might be quite fun today, but throwing money at anything that bothers you may not solve any underlying issues. In fact, it could bring about more problems later. The solution? Take an extra moment today to ensure that the spending you have in mind is a good idea. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. As long as you don't impulsively buy everything that strikes your fancy, you can probably avoid landing yourself in any serious financial bother.","An offer that sounds wonderful could have some strings attached at this time. That doesn't have to be a problem if you're aware of those strings and happy to accept them, but make sure you have the full picture first. Taking the easy way out by simply saying yes could lead to plenty of regrets. Don't be too worried about refusing -- if someone has assumed you'll go along with what they want without even asking you, that's their problem, not yours!","You might have to accept that this isn't a day for getting lots done. Couch naps may call your name and it'll be all too easy to put things off. Happily, there are probably at least a few things on today's list that can wait until tomorrow for your attention. Figure out which ones need to be finished right away and get them done as soon as possible. Once you're free, you can kick back and relax as much as you want!","Chattering pals might bore you almost to tears today. This could be especially irritating if you were hoping for a bit of peace and quiet. Still, these people are likely your friends for a reason. Try to have patience with any tedious conversations until you can politely disengage. Then you can take some time to enjoy being in your own space! You may want to spend a few hours reflecting on your next move -- any actual movement can wait until tomorrow."
2022-02-06,"Serious trouble may be brewing today! As the emotional Moon clashes with intense Pluto at 12:21 pm EST, resentment might fill the air and make it all too easy to take offense at something that really wasn't intended to be rude. Fortunately, we shouldn't have to bite our tongues for too long. Once the Moon slinks into grounded Taurus later in the day, the pressure could begin to lift. We can finally prioritize feeling comfortable and settled over any perceived slights.","Being objective might be difficult today. Due to the square between the melodramatic Moon and severe Pluto, it might be best to put off decisions where you can. This applies especially if jealousy is tempting you to push yourself forward. That probably won't gain you the respect you crave! Instead of giving in to the envy of others, try to soothe yourself with some well-deserved rewards. Eating a nice meal or buying something new to wear could put a real spring in your step.","Thoughts buzzing around your head could be putting you on edge at the moment. Do your best to keep your concerns organized, because a burst of energy is likely just around the bend, helping you actually get things done instead of just saying you're going to do them. Give yourself a bit of a shake and remind yourself that some of the things needling your pride really aren't worth wasting your energy on. Before responding to any comments, ask yourself if you're overreacting.","Myriad worries may feel like they're consuming your mind right now. People around you might not understand why you're so wound up, which could be frustrating. Still, keep in mind that they're probably busy with their own hassles. Taking some time out to enjoy your own company should help you feel refreshed and rejuvenated. You could also get involved in some sort of creative activity -- releasing your emotions in a healthy way, such as through writing or art, can help your spirit soar!","Someone close to you could be acting irrational today, but pointing it out won't suddenly make them more sensible. Consider the possibility their rationale is different from yours. There's no harm in seeing the world differently, so try not to get frustrated if you can't talk them into your point of view. Do your best to have patience as you socialize -- you might even begin to enjoy seeing people's little quirks. Being part of a group won't make you any less your own person.","A minor health worry could be nagging at you right now. There's no need to panic. You may simply be overthinking things -- however, it's possible that you need to surround yourself with people who are more supportive in general. Today you might receive an opportunity to do just that! No matter what happens, being sensitive to what people think doesn't have to be a bad thing. If you take their words with a grain of salt, others can be a good source of advice.","Causing friction with thoughtless words is dangerously easy today. The odd misunderstanding won't hurt, as long as you don't hunker down and stubbornly insist on sticking to whatever you said in the first place -- even if you're certain that you're right. Let Luna help you settle down as she moves into easygoing Taurus. You don't need to take absolutely everything so seriously. Instead of telling people how they're wrong, why not focus on how you can make your own life better?","Things may be getting on your nerves at home at this time. Do your best to stay calm and think about where others are coming from rather than shouting at people. You might be reading too much into a situation with someone that shares your living space. Instead of being resentful, take a deep breath and make an effort to find out what their point of view is. Your considerate actions could help them relax and be more understanding as well.","There's nothing wrong with airing your current grievances with people -- as long as that isn't all you do. Working out how you feel about a relationship, for better or for worse, will take less effort than usual, especially once the Moon enters reasonable Taurus. It may also become much easier to see things from another's point of view. Just remember in return that if you ask people what they think, they're likely to tell you. Are you sure you really want to know?","Something shiny could dig its claws into you and make your funds burn a hole in your pocket, but keeping a strong grip on your self-control now might be really worth it later. Do your best to stay busy with other things and avoid giving in to temptation. The trick is to work out what needs your attention now and what can wait until later. You can be much more productive and thrifty if you take a moment to think that through.","Your head and your heart could be yanking you in entirely different directions at the moment. The easiest option may be to avoid making too many decisions and just plan to have a good time. You might be itching for a temporary escape from your responsibilities, and so long as you don't over-indulge, relaxing can ease away any stresses you have. Just make sure that you finish anything that needs to be done today before you let loose and have fun!","With your mind wandering here, there, and everywhere, it could be hard to focus for much of today. It's OK to retreat into your safe space if necessary to help you feel better. Rather than rushing about, it'll likely be more productive in the long run to sit back and let your batteries recharge for now. Spending a little time alone with your thoughts should allow you to clarify precisely what those thoughts are -- and that's the first step toward acting on them!","Being surrounded by too many people today might put some pressure on you! You may want to keep busy, but you also probably prefer to do tasks in your own way and not deal with things imposed on you by others. The best approach could be to try to cut down on the chatter a bit. If everyone gets talking, no one is listening! You can set an example by stopping to draw breath from time to time and asking what other people think."
2022-02-07,"Today we're unlikely to sit twiddling our thumbs. With the sensitive Moon trining go-getter Mars at 2:12 pm EST before slinking alongside Uranus, things may get chaotic, but they aren't boring! The lesson is that the less we demand from others, the more they're likely to offer. We may be capable of doing things without help, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't appreciate aid when it's offered. Making a point to show our appreciation will likely be worth it in the future.","You may feel weighed down by your possessions just now. It could be a great day to clear some of them out! They're only things when it comes down to it, and others may be able to use them more than you do. Whether you give things away, have a garage sale, or list things online, the effect will be the same. You can finally have clear space for the things that really matter to you or simply enjoy more room to breathe.","Today is a day of relying on yourself. That doesn't mean you're necessarily on your own -- unless you want to be. Still, it's likely that you can get more done by focusing on what you're capable of achieving without help. If you do get some assistance, or even just some encouragement from the sidelines, that would just be a bonus. It's up to you to take the first step! Plus, doing things your way will be easier if you take the lead.","Acting on impulse could be your downfall at this time. If you hear something that catches you off balance, you may react before thinking things through. What feels like the right move in the moment might not be better in the long term. In fact, it could make things worse! The trick is not to rush any decisions, especially because you may not know everything about the situation. Doing nothing -- at least for the time being -- might be the wisest option.","The advice you receive today might be good, but it could also be hard to follow. No matter how well-intentioned people are, their main focus is likely on themselves rather than you. A helping hand is always good, but some people offer the wrong hand entirely! As long as you're prepared to rely on your own devices if need be, it shouldn't be a big problem. You may be pleasantly surprised by a bright idea that comes your way from someone you hardly know.","A burst of efficiency could make you get a lot done right now. It helps when other people are prepared to cooperate, but if they don't, you've still got this! Your energy level may be higher than usual, meaning you can charge about and help the world shape up -- even before stopping for a nice cup of coffee. Just beware of placing too much value on any offer that comes your way. They might be a lot more short-lived than they first appear.","Dreamland could feel like a lovely place to spend your day. Letting thoughts run wild might help you sort out what will work for you later. However, you need to ensure that you're grounded in reality before acting on your bright ideas. Being focused on the bigger picture means you might ignore details -- and those pesky little things can be the difference between success and failure. It might be worth dipping your toe in the water, but don't commit too deeply for now.","It might be wise to keep a closer eye than usual on your finances to avoid bother at the moment. If you're owed money, it would be best not to count on it until it's actually in your hands. Chances are that it's no one's fault, but a technical glitch could make things take extra time. It should be sorted out soon, but not by anyone stomping about in frustration. Once you've pointed out the issue, try to step back and have a little patience.","Someone close to you may seem distant today, but don't panic! They probably just have other things on their mind or want to spend time doing something that bores you even to think about. Either way, it's OK not to spend every moment with your loved ones. You could see this as an opportunity to do something you've been thinking about but never got around to before, or call someone you keep thinking you'll call next week. There are lots of ways to stay busy!","Being pragmatic can take you a long way right now -- even if you aren't usually the most organized sign. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how put together you are if everyone else is working in happy chaos. It could be frustrating, but you can't force people to stick to a routine. Try not to fret too much. Let the results of your good work speak for themselves! You might have to wait a while, but you'll be able to reap the rewards sooner or later.","You might experience a burst of creativity today, but it could be a very short burst. Acting fast can help you take advantage of it if you act fast, but it's OK if you find yourself struggling for the next bright thought. One good idea might be one more than most people you know receive today! You can expand your options by working with someone who shares your interests. If nothing else, they may help increase your motivation. Some healthy competition can be really inspiring.","Your domestic obligations could feel like a real drag at this time. As soon as you've dealt with one task, another might demand your attention. That said, you may be making a bigger fuss about the situation than necessary. Will the world really end if you embrace your lazy inclinations and leave some of those tasks for a day or two? A few of them could need your attention, but you can probably create a little bit of space to enjoy being yourself.","Endless entertainment might be found by listening to gossip today. You could be downright astonished by what you hear! Perhaps you had thought of a certain person in a particular way, and they've turned out to be someone entirely different. It may also make you see a situation in a new light. Of course, when you come down to it, hearsay isn't the most reliable source -- make an effort to verify the facts before you do anything based on what you hear."
2022-02-08,"Today likely feels far from restful. With assertive Mars trining disruptive Uranus at 9:57 am EST, it's tempting to throw off our inhibitions and do something crazy for the sake of it. Tempting, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't pay attention to the consequences of our actions -- though a few of us might not anyway. Forewarned is forearmed, so it would be wise to think things through first. Even so, making mistakes is always possible and taking a risk could be fun!","Indulging in a small treat could give you a boost today. However, being too lackadaisical with your cash at the best of times can lead to money becoming quite tight. You never know -- you might be able to have fun and avoid spending money by window-shopping or browsing online. You can always buy things later once you can afford them. Still, if your budget will allow it, a minor extravagance could make you feel a lot better than you imagined.","Change is favored by the universe right now. Think about letting your hair down and taking a risk! Maybe it won't work out, but if you don't try you'll never know. It doesn't have to be a big deal -- even a small change to your routine could brighten things up. Let your instincts guide you through your day, without worrying too much about whether or not you're being sensible. Despite what you might think, being practical isn't always the right approach.","Your past could be affecting you in the present. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can throw you a little off course. You may need to retreat for a short time to consider your next move. Your intuition is likely to serve you well at the moment, so even if you can't figure out exactly why something will work, there's a good chance it will. A few extra moments of reflection now could save you from a lot of grief later.","Connecting with new people could liven things up at this time. That doesn't mean you should ignore your current friends -- instead, seek out space to add more. Joining forces with someone who shares your interests could add sparkle to your life. Make today the day you join a new group or club! It could turn out to be even more enjoyable than you'd anticipated. New connections or fresh activities found in that community might even lead you in a totally different direction.","Today is about grabbing opportunities! It's best to react as soon as you can. Despite how things may appear, something within your grasp might not be around for long. You could end up kicking yourself later if you lose out due to procrastination. The only bad response would be not bothering to respond at all. If you're not convinced, you can stick with a firm negative answer. However, chances are that you'll be ready to agree and that you won't regret your decision.","You might need to temper your enthusiasm a little at the moment. Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion and allowed to share it with others. Still, try to read the room before volunteering your ideas about things. Your friends are likely already willing to listen, but remember that it isn't a personal attack if they disagree with your plans. It would be a boring world if all of us thought the same -- plus, they might have some good points.","Getting into an argument about money will be all too easy at this time. Try to remember that shouting about it will likely result in more fighting and won't resolve the issue. Though it may take some effort, biting your tongue and listening to the opposing view will be worth it in the long run. There's a chance they're right! Even if you still decide they're in the wrong, they'll probably be more prepared to listen to you once you've listened to them.","You're probably even more irresistibly fun than usual right now! It might be hard to put your finger on it, but something you're doing could be pulling people to your side. If you want to spend a few hours with a loved one, you may be spoiled for choice. There's no need to waste too much time analyzing what's going on. You can still enjoy something -- even if it doesn't make sense to you. Don't be afraid to take a chance.","A burst of daring energy could fuel you at the moment. If there's something you've been meaning to get around to, consider moving other plans to make the time. You can probably achieve much more than you realize -- you just need to get the ball rolling! Though it might look like it requires some serious effort from you right now, the results will probably be more than worthwhile. Plus, it might not require quite as much hard work as you first think.","It's up to you to stop life from being too dull today. Not everything has to last forever -- it's OK to enjoy having a good time simply for the sake of it. That said, fun may not come knocking at your door. You might have to get outside and chase it! Even if you have other things you need to do, those tasks should go more smoothly if you allow yourself time to have fun before you get started.","This could be a great time to tackle a few home repairs or DIY. An extra burst of energy should help you get more done than usual, though you might have to beware of rushing things and being too slapdash. If things have waited this long, they can likely wait a little longer. Make an effort to focus on getting one or two things done well instead of diving into everything at once. The long-term results could make it more than worth it.","You don't need to share everything that pops into your head today. Your mouth is likely moving much faster than your brain -- you could easily offend someone. Instead of going through a long explanation about how you didn't mean that in the way it came out, it would be better to think twice before sharing information. Some stories aren't yours, so if you aren't sure whether or not to be discreet, you probably should be. You can always update people later if necessary."
2022-02-09,"There's a fine line between interest versus gossip and curiosity versus nosiness today. The trick is to stay on the right side of that line! With the inquisitive Moon moving into chatty Gemini at 5:27 am EST, grabbing at new information is instinctive for many of us. It's what we do with the information that could cause problems. Some stories aren't ours to tell -- and no matter how much we know, there's probably more to learn. It's best to avoid jumping to conclusions.","You probably won't have time to feel bored today. Regardless of your actual plans, it's likely you'll be busy. With so much going on, you might find it hard to focus. As soon as one thing grabs your attention, you may be distracted by the next one. Even if things seem clear in your mind, it would be wise to stop talking once in a while and simply listen. Otherwise, you could miss out on something that would make all the difference.","Pragmatism is valuable at the moment. Rather than seeking excitement, try to seek out what's tried and true. Your weak spot could be your spending. It might be hard to ignore the temptation to splurge on something that's no more than a momentary whim. To avoid trouble, ask yourself if you really, really want whatever's grabbed your interest -- and be honest with yourself! If you aren't sure, you can almost always wait a day or two to make any major purchases.","Today is about being led by your feelings rather than by logic. If it feels right, it probably is! That doesn't mean you should ignore the facts -- in fact, the more information, the better. Of course, sometimes there can be more than one right answer, and your intuition can lead you toward the answer that works for YOU. Remember that there's no need to turn your life upside down unless you really want to. Even the tiniest changes can have a long-lasting effect.","Some solitude might be necessary right now! Taking a few hours alone with your thoughts could be on the agenda today. Even a little bit of time can make a difference. Before you can chase your dreams, you need to be clear with yourself on what those dreams are -- they probably aren't what they used to be. Actually acting on a decision can come later. For now, it should be enough to decide the type of decisions you need to make.","Life is simply more interesting with others around right now! Don't hesitate to surround yourself with people. Whether you're with friends, coworkers, or even just acquaintances, there are lots of intriguing conversations to be had. Just avoid taking things too seriously! The more that people chatter, the more likely it is that someone will say something rude. Still, it's probably less of a big deal than you think it is. If you need to respond, try to be more polite than they were.","Feeling rather unappreciated could really wear on you today. While getting a bit more respect shouldn't do you any harm, consider the possibility that you're just feeling a touch over-sensitive. You don't have to work every hour of every day to receive respect! The easiest way to encourage positive feedback would be to offer it freely -- to others and yourself. They'll probably appreciate the kind words and may also be inspired to offer some genuine appreciation to you in return.","You deserve an adventure! This could be a great moment to break free from your usual routine. It might not be practical to drop everything and run off into the sunset, but you can still make plenty of plans for later. Knowing you have something better and brighter waiting for you could be enough to put an extra spring in your step. Your plans don't even have to involve lots of time or money, as long as they can expand your horizons in some way.","You could need to be wary of over-reacting at this time. It's not necessarily wrong to take offense to what someone says, but their words might not be the end of the world, either. To be fair to them, they simply may not know what you want. Make a point to think your desires through and be objective before picking a fight with anyone. You might decide you were right in the first place, but at least you'll be certain about your motivation.","Today could bring the perfect moment to stand up for yourself. However, leaping in expecting an argument to become a knock-down, drag-out fight isn't the best way to go about your life. Even a tiny bit of consideration for other people's feelings and different points of view could nip most debates in the bud before they even get off the ground. You don't have to give in right away, but keep in mind that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.","Today's task list might seem like it was specifically designed to get on your nerves -- even more so if everyone else seems to be hanging around in a really relaxed way. No matter how organized you usually are, taking time to lay out your thoughts might help. Even the best arrangements need tidying up from on occasion! A little tweak here and there could make all the difference. Try not to let it stress you out. After all, you're only human.","Having good fun with good company may be on your to-do list right now. Enjoy yourself and indulge your whims when you can -- but don't forget to be at least a little sensible. It's all in the planning! Instead of casting caution to the winds and launching into something that sounds fun, make an effort to secure all the ins and outs of your plans. That way you can avoid any potential disappointments and maybe have an even better time than you expected.","Having a safe space that you can retreat to is very important at the moment, no matter what's going on in your general life. Feeling safe and supported could help immensely when it comes to dealing with what the world throws at you. One way of ensuring support for yourself is by being prepared to offer to others. Have you told your loved ones how much you appreciate them or asked if they need a helping hand? Consider reaching out and making the first move!"
2022-02-10,"A firm dose of pragmatic and changeable energy is in store for us today. The changeable Moon makes a flowing trine to down-to-earth Saturn at 3:20 pm EST, and Saturn is comfortably at home in its home sign, Aquarius. While being more sensible probably doesn't sound exciting, the dull part of it should be short-lived. Flexing a little bit of self-discipline could bring us much better results than we thought. In the end, doing things properly can bring its own special satisfaction.","You're now very likely to recognize the value of some of your old friends. There's a reason why they're still around after all this time! While that doesn't mean you don't want to bring new people into your life from time to time, it can be tiring getting to know new people and all their quirks. Sometimes being able to cut right to the chase is nice. Knowing what to expect can also be comforting, especially when you want to focus your energy elsewhere.","Balancing your work and personal lives can be easier than usual today. The trick is showing others how dependable you can be when it really matters. It isn't that you aren't usually reliable, but sometimes when people do their jobs skillfully and quietly, no one notices their hard work. Wanting to be seen is natural! It won't do you any harm to blow your own trumpet a little, so you can get the credit for your efforts that you deserve.","You might question whether you're just going through the motions at the moment. Some of your ideas have been around for so long, you might be wondering if they're still you. Consider taking a closer look at your belief system. While you may decide that those philosophies do still suit you, you might realize you aren't that person anymore instead. Whether you choose to make changes or not, the process of figuring yourself out can help you have more confidence.","Dealing with money issues that involve someone else might not be too complicated at this time. Whether you owe money or something less tangible, you could make a better deal than usual by focusing on the details. Maybe paying up a little earlier than you originally planned could make a small difference, or perhaps you don't owe quite as much as you thought. Taking a closer look at your finances can help answer your questions and clarify your available options.","Your closest relationships might currently be a lot more logical and pragmatic than you'd prefer. No matter how much fun you want to have, building practical partnerships will be healthier in the long run -- and this is a great opportunity to lay their foundations. Try to address any small problems before they grow into major issues, no matter how dull that seems. Taking care of those things the moment that they pop up can pave the way for a smooth future.","There's no need to rush! Being even more practical than usual today could help you reduce your workload. Even so, if things start to get on top of you, all you need to do is ask for help. People might not realize you need it if you don't say anything, so don't hesitate to make your voice heard. Working together with others and using tried-and-true methods may bring amazing results. Even if there are technically better approaches, something familiar would probably be best right now.","Taking risks might be more enticing than ever. Usually, games of chance could go in either direction. Right now, though, you're likely to be great at working out if the odds are in your favor. Of course, there are never any guarantees, but things should be alright if you can act sensibly enough not to risk more than you can afford to lose. This isn't just about money -- whether you're gambling with physical resources or with your emotions, the principle remains the same.","This is an ideal time to deal with minor issues at home. You might prefer to kick off your shoes and relax, but that could be cut short when thoughts spin around your head about things that need doing. Contrary to what you may think, it will likely be easier to deal with them than it would to try and avoid them. They probably won't go away if you just ignore them! Once you get them out of the way, you can relax without stress.","You may need a helping hand at this time. You don't need to fret if that's the case, as there could be plenty of assistance available. It might not have occurred to you before, but an older peer, or someone else you have only a passing acquaintance with, might be more than happy to step in and offer some helpful advice. Trading favors with neighbors can be a great way for everyone to get things done, but it may never happen unless you reach out!","Your finances are likely to be working well for you now. Being thrifty and economical isn't always exciting, but it can remove a lot of potential worries. Though you might feel you have to make changes to how you spend your money, that may not be necessary. After all, if it ain't broke, don't fix it! Keeping the same budget could also make life easier. However, if a close look tells you that a tiny change could benefit you, today is when to make it.","Today may be less about fun and more about getting things done. You might feel slightly irritable at first, but that should wear off soon. If you've been keeping on top of things, what you have to do could be downright easy. Even if you haven't, your tasks aren't necessarily as big a deal as you might think. As long as you stay level-headed, you can probably get everything done and still have plenty of time left to enjoy yourself later.","You may enjoy spending time by yourself right now. As a private Pisces, you're likely to know better than most people that there's a difference between being alone and lonely. You might not have any firm plans or be trying to avoid anything, so feel free to simply exist in your own space and contemplate your own thoughts. Finding calm time like this can be difficult in this busy world, so it would be wise to take full advantage of it when you can."
2022-02-11,"We're drawn to consider who's in control today. When thinking Mercury catches up to sit next to intense Pluto at 9:04 am EST, it heralds a time for getting to the bottom of things. Maybe not all the answers are out there, but until we ask questions, we won't find any of them. The planets encourage us to dig deep and cast a wide net to learn as much as possible! There's always more to find out, but we can get a great start right now.","Knowing who's who and what's what could be your special power at this time. Joining the dots between the facts you pick up here and there can be invaluable, but that information won't get you very far unless you're willing to use it. If you've been waiting for the right moment to convince someone important that you're worth paying attention to, that moment may arrive before the end of the day! It's simply a matter of being alert and grabbing the opportunity when it presents itself.","Being convincing and being right aren't the same thing, which you may be particularly aware of now. Some people are better at making their point than others, but that doesn't mean they have all the answers. They might not even be asking the right questions! If you aren't careful, you might end up ignoring people who aren't as eloquent, even though they really do know what they're talking about. It could help to step back and consider what's actually been said before committing yourself.","Working things out for yourself can be more satisfying than usual today. Mysteries are always much more interesting when they stay mysteries! However, you probably want to get to the bottom of things now, regardless of how much effort it takes. If the end result is a little disappointing, you might have to remind yourself that there are still plenty of other things to learn. Plus, if you share what you've learned, you might find that other people are much more impressed than you'd anticipated.","What you say matters almost as much as what you do today. A close friend may be hanging onto your every word! If that's the case, you'll want to make sure they're really good words. Even if it isn't, gathering your words before you share them with others can help everyone better understand you. This is also an ideal time to make a specific point or to talk someone into something. Your skills of persuasion are likely to be better than they've been for ages.","It could feel as if someone is constantly looking over your shoulder at the moment. That may make it hard to get on with your daily tasks -- particularly if your audience offers some unwanted commentary. Unfortunately, if you fight back they might believe that you're trying to hide something. The best approach could be to grit your teeth and try to let it wash over you. Once your critics realize there's nothing to worry about, there's a chance they'll back off.","Small steps can get the ball rolling right now -- especially creatively. It's one thing to come up with innovative ideas. Acting on them is quite another! If you're not sure exactly how you should go about things, maybe you need a bit more information. Try to get to figure out what inspires you by spending a bit of time researching the facts online or leafing through a good book. The sooner you start, the sooner you can spark any vague ideas into real action.","You may think that someone close to you -- perhaps a family member -- is keeping a secret from you today. Even if they are, try to consider their point of view. They might be worried about how you'll react or not have all the facts they need to share. There's no need to make a big deal out of something that might turn out to be trivial in the end. A bit of patience can go a very long way.","What people say and what they mean can be very different things at this time. Listening very carefully will serve you well, because what others don't say might be just as important as what they do say. Fortunately, there's no need to feel paranoid. People probably aren't trying to keep you out of the loop so much as they think you already know what they're referencing. You might have to ask more questions than usual, but the answers should arrive soon if you persist.","The world isn't conspiring against you right now -- even if it feels like it is. It may be way too easy to misplace things, so it's worth thoroughly searching and asking around for any items before giving up on finding them. Plus, if it is genuinely lost, fretting about it won't help. You may need to find a replacement or try to manage without it. Once you push yourself to do something productive to resolve the situation, you'll probably feel a lot better.","Today is a great day to talk someone into something. You're likely to be blessed with amazing powers of persuasion, so you may as well use them! Even if you don't, people are more likely to agree with you than usual. They may also find you particularly trustworthy -- and you can prove yourself worthy of that trust. Between your powerful focus helping you get to the point and your ability to keep a secret, you can be a communication powerhouse today.","You don't need to make excuses about what you're doing today -- it's probably no one's business but your own. Wanting some privacy doesn't mean you're up to anything dodgy. When it comes down to it, others might be less interested than you thought they would be. It isn't that you're boring or what you're doing doesn't matter, it's likely more that they have their own things to worry about. If you feel like quietly getting on with things, you can do just that.","There's nothing wrong with taking your friends seriously, but right now you might be acting a little intense. You may worry that they're trying to manipulate you, but the truth could be simpler. Maybe they enjoy your company and want to hang out with you, or perhaps they really like that place they're suggesting you go to. There's a difference between sharing fun and trying to make sure things go their way, but you might have to pay close attention to get it right."
2022-02-12,"Tension might try to drag us down today, but it shouldn't be more than a minor blip. With the feeling Moon making a trine to positive Jupiter at 2:35 pm EST, contentment and optimism are available if we can be bothered to reach for them. With minimal effort, it should be possible to hold onto our good moods. Even though we might have to fake it till we make it if someone winds us up, we can still remain wrapped in a warm, happy glow.","Some serious shopping might be tempting you right now. On the other hand, you may wonder if you already own too many things and should start shedding a few. Don't worry -- as long as you spend reasonably, it's OK to buy something small that brings you joy. Treating a friend could also make you feel good, but that positive feeling won't last for too long if you can't really afford it. Be wise with your budget and you can have lots of fun!","Running errands is probably very low on your list of priorities at this time. You may have much more interesting ways to spend your time. Although some things may demand your attention, there might be others that you can leave until later. That being said, it's OK if you need to get out and about. That trivial chat you have while waiting at a store or getting something repaired could supply you with information you didn't even know you needed!","This is a great day for sitting back at home and chilling out. While you may have a few nuisances to take care of before you can really relax, you should still have a few opportunities to wind down. Make an effort to take care of any unfinished business before stuffing yourself with snacks, watching TV, or having fun in your own favorite way. Just a few minutes doing the boring thing should allow you to let loose in the way you deserve.","Taking a minor chance right now could pay off in a big way later. You may come across someone who could really help your career. Even if your arrangement doesn't work out in the long run, you probably don't have anything to lose by taking them up on their offer -- and you could have a huge amount to gain! Stay on the ball and be prepared to say ""yes"" if someone makes you an offer that seems worth your time.","Any personal vices could look extra tantalizing at the moment. No matter what delicious treats or activities tempt you, keeping a close eye on them could pay off later. Plus, not paying close attention to what you put into your mouth could lead be regrettable. Keep in mind how moderation -- or lack of moderation -- affects your image. Stuffing your face with donuts or getting distracted by games while someone important is trying to get your attention might not be a great look.","Someone in your life right now could back you up before you even realize you need the help. Life can be much easier when someone confirms you have the right approach! However, you might be a little too unrealistic about what you're capable of. No one wants to suggest that you shouldn't chase your dreams, but some desires are more practical than others. Whimsical ideas that pop into your head one minute and are gone the next probably aren't worth wasting much energy on.","Money matters may weigh on your mind right now. If you ask for a loan, there's a good chance you'll get it -- but you should first ask yourself if you really need it. If you have a little patience, you might end up being able to manage perfectly well without putting yourself into debt or increasing any debt you already have. Try to wait and see how the day pans out. You never know what good things the future could hold!","You could take move further along the path to achieving your dreams today. The trick is to look more closely at why others do what they do, to understand their motives as well as your own. The information is probably there if you look for it, but you may have to work a little harder than you'd anticipated. It shouldn't be a big deal, though. Just remember the bigger picture and where you fit into it -- that knowledge can be invaluable.","Confidence can fill your heart at this moment, as the universe encourages you to ask for all the recognition you deserve. Even if people don't have the time or ability to reward you, at least you'll have reminded them of the good work you do. Happily, there's a decent chance that they'll be able to do something if you put yourself out there! You might already be happy with the way things are, but that doesn't mean that they can't be even better.","Surrounding yourself with people could give you a real buzz today. Just listening to everyone chat and hearing the thoughts and ideas of others can be inspiring. At the very least, you should enjoy yourself, and there's nothing wrong with that! Your inhibitions are likely to take a dip, which could make expressing your true self much easier. Those around you may appreciate it even if they can't put their finger on what exactly is giving you that extra sparkle at this time.","The world could seem plagued by unreality today. Working out where your focus has gone may feel almost impossible. Luckily, that befuddlement is unlikely to last long. If you allow yourself, you could even enjoy letting your thoughts wander where they may. There might be some excellent ideas in the back of your mind if you give them space to emerge. You may also be able to get out of a familial obligation to allow yourself even more time to let your thoughts run wild.","You could be the most important person in your life right now, and that's OK! Valuing yourself and your time is an important part of having a healthy self-image. It may feel easier than usual to believe in yourself today, which makes it easier to do what you enjoy. That said, you don't need to make every moment of your day about feeling good. Some moderation won't do you any harm. Just don't let yourself be bogged down by obligations to people you barely know."
